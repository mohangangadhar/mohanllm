It\u2019s worth reflecting on how close the world came to an indescribable catastrophe last November. Another 4 years of Trump\u2019s race to the abyss might have had incalculable consequences. His worshippers of course don\u2019t see it this way, but, remarkably, the same is true of segments of the left. In fact, liberal litanies of his abuses also largely skirt his major crimes. Worth consideration when we recognize that he or some clone might soon regain the levers of power. Also worth consideration are the warnings by thousands of scientists that we are approaching irreversible tipping points in environmental destruction. We can read all about it in Aljazeera."

    "output": "Even during the Obama years, international polls showed that world opinion regarded the US as the greatest threat to world peace, no other country even close. Americans were protected from the news, though one could learn about it from foreign media and dissident sources. Sometimes illustrations are reported. Thus there has been some mention of the recent UN vote condemning the savage Cuba sanctions, virtually a blockade: 180-2 (US-Israel). The NY Times dismissed it as a chance for critics of the US to blow off steam. That\u2019s quite normal. When there are reports of how the world is out of step, the usual framework is curiosity about the psychic maladies that lead to such pathological failure to recognize our nobility. There\u2019s nothing new about that stance. It\u2019s typical of imperial cultures. Even such an outstanding figure as John Stuart Mill wondered about the world\u2019s failure to comprehend that Britain was an angelic power, sacrificing itself for the benefit of the world \u2013 at a moment when Britain was carrying out some of its most horrifying crimes, as he knew very well."

Both Russia and China claim they are merely responding to intimidation and military threats posed by the U.S. What\u2019s your view? Do Russia and China have imperial ambitions or are they just trying to defend themselves against what they see as an increasingly aggressive U.S. military?",
    "output": "Some background facts may be useful. According to the major international monitor, SIPRI, \u201cThe growth in total [military] spending in 2020 was largely influenced by expenditure patterns in the United States and China. The USA increased its military spending for the third straight year to reach $778 billion in 2020,\u201d as compared with China\u2019s increase to $252 billion (far less per capita of course). In fourth place, below India, is Russia: $61.7 billion. The US is alone in facing no credible security threats, apart from alleged threats at the borders of adversaries, who are ringed with US nuclear-armed missiles in some of the 800 US military bases around the world (China has one, Djibouti). There have been international efforts to prevent the militarization of outer space, a major threat to survival. They have been initiated primarily by China and Russia, blocked for many years by Washington."

What is the justification for what Russia and China see as provocations and aggressiveness, if not actual preparation for a war?",
    "output": "It\u2019s extremely dangerous. Strategic planning has been redesigned to focus on war with China and Russia. Provocative actions have been taken on their borders, already bristling with US offensive weapons. China is violating international law in the South China Sea \u2013 though the US, the only maritime power not to have ratified the UN Law of the Sea, is not in a strong position to object. The right response to China\u2019s violations is not a dangerous show of force but diplomacy and negotiations, led by the regional states most directly involved. The major threat is over Taiwan. Again thoughtful diplomacy, not provocative actions, can avert what could be disastrous."

    "input": "In a democracy, at least in theory citizens have a say in all matters of public policy. Yet, in the end none of the recent military campaigns and undeclared wars seem to achieve much popular favor or support. What is and what should be the role of everyday citizens in determining the foreign policy and military priorities of the country? Or are such matters better left to the \u201cexperts\u201d?",
    "output": "According to the Constitution, Article I, Congress has the sole right to declare war. But that provision has long been dispatched to the ashcan, along with other inconvenient provisions of the document that we are taught to revere. In a functioning democracy, citizens should have the primary role in affairs of the state. Not here. And they should be informed citizens. Not here. World War I is a classic example. In 1916, Wilson won on a platform of \u201cpeace without victory.\u201d He then launched an impressive propaganda campaign to inflame a pacifist population with bitter hatred of all things German, fortified with fabrications about Hun atrocities concocted by the British \u201cMinistry of Information\u201d; Orwellism was alive and well long before Orwell. It was highly successful. It wasn\u2019t the first such occasion, nor the last. State propaganda remains highly effective, everywhere we turn, reinforced by the loyal media and intellectual class. striking example, with considerable import, was just released a few hours before I sat down to write: \u201cmore Americans think Iran possesses nuclear weapons than think Israel does. While Israel has been known to possess nuclear weapons for decades (without officially acknowledging it) and Iran is not known to have ever possessed any, the American public perception presumes a different reality: 60.5%, including 70.6% of Republicans and 52.6% of Democrats, say Iran possesses nuclear weapons \u2014 compared to 51.7% who say Israel does, including 51.7% of Republicans and 51.9% of Democrats.\u201d. The achievements of unremitting propaganda can be quite stunning. Again, the media help in a variety of ways. To take one highly relevant case, the NY Times editors recently joined virtually the entire world, including Iran, in calling for a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle East. That would end the alleged threat of Iranian nuclear weapons and radically reduce severe and very dangerous regional tensions. One small matter was omitted in the editors\u2019 proposal: Israel, the one regional power with nuclear weapons, in fact, a formidable supply. Also omitted was why this critically important proposal is not implemented: the US blocks it, to ensure that Israel\u2019s massive armaments will not be inspected. In fact, the US government refuses to recognize officially that Israel has nuclear weapons, though it is not in doubt. If it were to do so, US law might become applicable, arguably banning all aid to Israel. Best for the rabble not to know that their lives are being threatened in order to protect Israel\u2019s malfeasance and US participation in it."

They might say Noam Chomsky, we associate him with anti-interventionism, with opposition to U.S. foreign policy, and U.S. military interventions abroad. Why are the Kurds the exception to that, you know, life-long, career-long opposition to U.S. military interventions, especially in the Middle East?",
    "output": "If you take a look at what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s not intervention. Syria was already invaded by Turkey. The troops that are there were essentially doing nothing except deterring an expansion of a further invasion. You have to not deal with slogans as if it\u2019s a religious catechism. You have to ask how they apply in particular to complex human circumstances. MH:I take your point. But I do want to explore this a bit more broadly because I\u2019ve agreed with a lot of what you\u2019ve written over the years in terms of U.S. foreign policy in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Latin America. And as you know, and you\u2019ve written so eloquently on, a lot of these interventions, invasions, bombing campaigns, regime changes, are justified on humanitarian grounds, with leaders saying what you\u2019re saying that we should protect civilians. A liberal interventionist listening to you speaking now might say, \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t Noam Chomsky support the Kosovo intervention to protect Albanians? Why didn\u2019t he support a no fly zone for Syrian Arabs in Idlib or Aleppo who were being bombed by Assad? Why only the Kurds?\u201d Let\u2019s take your first example, Kosovo. I opposed the NATO bombing because it was known both to the Clinton administration and to the press, which refused to report it, that the bombing would radically increase the level of crimes and atrocities against the people in Kosovo. General Wesley Clark informed the Clinton administration weeks earlier that that\u2019s exactly what would happen. He informed the press when the invasion began that that\u2019s what was gonna happen. The reason I opposed it was because there were diplomatic options available. And instead, NATO, meaning the U.S., chose to undertake a major military attack consciously knowing that it would greatly increase atrocities as the Serbs couldn\u2019t react by bombing Washington. So they\u2019d react on the ground. You have to ask yourself, in each circumstance, what are the consequences of your decisions? If you don\u2019t do that, you\u2019re not a moral human being. Now you\u2019re perfectly right that every monster you can think of in history has declared that whatever acts they\u2019re going to carry out are for humanitarian reasons. Now, if you have a brain functioning, what you do is ask is this correct? Or isn\u2019t it correct? You don\u2019t say, because Hitler said it was a humanitarian intervention in the Sudetenland therefore, there are no humanitarian interventions."

Why only for the Kurds when they\u2019re being butchered by Erdogan?",
    "output": "Because there was no way for a small contingent of U.S. troops to deter Assad.

    "output": "Well, first of all, let\u2019s separate those two issues. A small contingent of troops to deter Turkish aggression would have nothing to do with Iran. So we put that aside, what are the prospects for a war against Iran? It\u2019s hard to say. I don\u2019t think the Trump administration could answer. I don\u2019t think they want a war. A war could have extremely harsh effects not only out of Iran, but much more generally. So for example, Saudi Arabia\u2019s major oil production, almost all the oil production is in the northeast corner right in the Shiite areas, very close to Iran. They have missile capacities. They could devastate one of the main oil producers in the world. There could be many other consequences. So I don\u2019t think the United States wants a war with Iran. What they want to do is torture Iranians as much as possible in the hope that destruction of the economy will lead to some breakdown inside Iran. But that can easily get out of hand. Any accidental incidents in the Gulf, could blow up suddenly and could lead to an attack. Newscaster:Tensions on the rise in the Persian Gulf once again. The United States says Iran is behind attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf. Now, lawmakers say the Trump administration says it already has the legal authority to begin a war with Iran. It wouldn\u2019t really be an invasion. The U.S. is not going to invade Iran. That\u2019s much too costly. It would be an attack from a safe distance."

So the mainstream Democrats, the ones who are now meeting with their billionaire friends to try to figure out how to get rid of Sanders and Warren, they\u2019re basically what used to be called moderate Republicans. The Democrats abandoned the working class by the late \u201970s. The last bit of a show of interest was the Humphrey Hawkins 1978 Full Employment Bill which Carter watered down so that it had no teeth. And after that, they kind of gave up.

Given the last three years, the Charlottesville, the, you know, what\u2019s been going on recently, the attacks on synagogues and mosques, his far-right rallies where they chant \u201csend them back,\u201d it\u2019s pretty clear that he has now gone in a full on white nationalist white supremacist direction, isn\u2019t it?",
    "output": "But that\u2019s part of the problem of the Republican party. Its primary constituency is extreme wealth and corporate power. Those are the ones they serve. So you take the one legislative achievement of the Trump administration, the tax scam. That was for the rich and the very rich and the corporate sector. Take deregulation, does it help working people to eliminate eliminate health and safety conditions in the workplace? Does it increase profits? Okay, we know the answer. Same across the board. So you run across the legislative programs, the ones that are carried out by the really evil characters, Mitch McConnell. Before him, Ryan and so on. Those, those policies are dedicated to the traditional Republican constituency. But you can\u2019t get votes on those policies. So you have to mobilize some kind of a voting base. And the way they did it is, as I described it, as you know. MH:Mobilize the racists. So if it turns out that white nationalists are the voting base that you can mobilize, Trump will become a white nationalist. I think it does him too much credit to attribute to him beliefs like support for white nationalism, or fascism or anything else. His motive is himself. And he\u2019s a good enough politician to understand that the only way he\u2019s going to get support is by appealing to those sectors of those sectors of the population. One should bear in mind the utter cynicism of the Republican Party since Reagan. Take their actual planks. One unbreakable commitment of the Republican party is anti-abortion. What\u2019s called pro-life. Where\u2019d that come from? You go back to the 1960s. The leading republican figures, Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, all the rest of them were what we call pro-choice. What changed? Well, in the 1970s, Republican strategist, Paul Weyrich, had the brilliant idea that if the Republicans pretended, I stress pretended, to be anti-abortion, they could pick up the evangelical vote and the northern working class Catholic vote. So they turned on a dime. They all became passionately anti-abortion. Take climate change. That\u2019s an interesting one. You go just 10 years, 2008 John McCain when he ran for president had a global warming plank, not very strong but something. John McCain:There are vital measures we can take in the short-term even as we focus on long-term policies to mitigate the effects of global warming. The Republicans were in fact toying with cap and trade. What happened to it? Very simple. David Koch, died recently. The Koch brothers launched a huge campaign, major juggernaut, bribing congressmen, threatening them, intimidating them. Huge lobbying organization, fake popular organizations to you know, knock on doors and so on. They switched. Now, part of the catechism is you have to be against climate change."

Do you support the House Democrats\u2019 decision to finally start an impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump?",

Is it the right thing to do? I mean, Trump is impeachable 100 times over. You know, he\u2019s a major crook. There\u2019s no doubt about it. Is it politically wise? I frankly doubt it. I think it\u2019ll turn out pretty much like the Mueller report, which, that I thought was also a political mistake. What\u2019ll happen is probably the House will impeach, goes to the Senate. The Republican senators are utterly craven. They\u2019re terrified of Trump\u2019s voting base. So they\u2019ll vote to turn down the impeachment request. Trump will come along, say I\u2019m vindicated. Say it was the Deep State and the treacherous Dems trying to overturn the election. Oh, vote for me."

MH:How would you define that to someone listening at home saying, \u201cWell, what does that mean if Noam Chomsky is an anarchist?\u201d Well, what does anarchism mean? And it\u2019s the whole long tradition actually going back to classical liberalism. It fundamentally means opposition to structures of authority and domination unless they can justify themselves. Illegitimate structures of domination and hierarchy ranging from paternalistic family to business which is a tyranny in which people rent themselves as slaves, to international affairs. Anywhere across this domain if you find illegitimate authority, it should be eliminated. I suspect most people believe that. Of course, that means lots of consequences. It means they should be opposed to private tyrannies. People who are called libertarians in the United States, strange notion, very anti-libertarian, are fundamentally calling for rule by unaccountable private tyrannies.

We are now in a situation where this generation, in fact, in the next few years, is going to have to make a decision of cosmic significance which has never arisen before: Will organized human society survive? And there are two enormous threats. The threat of environmental catastrophe, which at least is getting some attention, not enough. The other is the threat of nuclear war, which is increasing sharply by the Trump administration, in fact. These have to be dealt with quickly. Otherwise, there\u2019s nothing to talk about. And notice that the wrecking ball in the White House just doesn\u2019t give a damn. He\u2019s having fun. He\u2019s serving his rich constituency. So what the hell, let\u2019s destroy the world. And it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t know it. Some months ago, maybe a year ago by now, one of the Trump bureaucracies the National Transportation Administration came out with what I think is the most astonishing document in the entire history of the human species. It got almost no attention. It was a long 500-page environmental assessment in which they tried to determine what the environment would be like at the end of the century. And they concluded, by the end of the century, temperatures will have risen seven degrees Fahrenheit, that\u2019s about twice the level that scientists regard as feasible for organized human life. The World Bank describes it as cataclysmic. So what\u2019s their conclusion? Conclusion is we should have no more constraints on automotive emissions. The reasoning is very solid. We\u2019re going off the cliff anyway. So why not have fun? Has anything like that ever appeared in human history? There\u2019s nothing like it. MH:There\u2019s nothing like this administration in particular. One last question before I let you go, you\u2019re about to turn 91 years old. You\u2019re still going strong doing interviews like this one, teaching at the University of Arizona. What keeps you going? What motivates you? I\u2019m sure a lot of people listening would like to know. What\u2019s the alternative? It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s easy, personal life.

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: It\u2019s been said by far too many, including myself, that we live in dark times. And for good reasons. We live in an era where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, authoritarianism is a global political phenomenon, and life on Earth is entering a state of collapse. From that perspective, human civilization is on an inexorable course of decline and nothing but a radical overhaul of the way humans conduct themselves will save us from a return to barbarism. Yet, there are at the same time signs of progress on numerous fronts, which are hard to overlook. Societies are becoming increasingly multicultural and also more aware of and sensitive to patterns of racism and discrimination. In the light of all this, do we see the glass half empty or half full? Moreover, is it possible to evaluate the qualities of decline and progress scientifically, or do we have to rely purely on normative evaluations and value judgments?",
    "output": "There are attempts to measure the contents of the glass. The best-known is the Doomsday Clock of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, with the hands placed a certain distance from midnight: the end. Each year that Trump was in office, the minute hand was moved closer to midnight, soon reaching the closest it had ever been, then going beyond. The analysts finally abandoned minutes and turned to seconds: 100 seconds to midnight, where the Clock now stands. That seems to me a fair assessment. The analysts identify three major crises: nuclear war, environmental destruction and the deterioration of rational discourse. As we\u2019ve often discussed, Trump has made a signal contribution to each, and the party he now owns is carrying his legacy forward. They are also currently hard at work to regain power by overcoming the dread danger of a government of the people, with plenty of far right big money at hand. If the project succeeds, emptying of the glass will be accelerated. There has indeed been progress on many fronts. It is startling to look back and see what was regarded as proper behavior and acceptable attitudes not many years ago, even written into law. While substantial, the progress has not, however, been sufficient to contain and reverse the continuing assault on the social order, the natural world and the climate of rational discourse. Without disparaging the great activist achievements, it\u2019s hard sometimes to suppress memory of an ironic slogan of the \u201860s: They may win the battles, but we have all the best songs. The glass that is before our eyes is not an encouraging sight, to put it mildly. Take the state of the three major crises identified in the setting of the Clock. The major nuclear powers are obligated by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \u201cto pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.\u201d They are pursuing the opposite course. In its latest annual survey, the prime monitor of global armament, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, reports that \u201cThe growth in total spending in 2020 was largely influenced by expenditure patterns in the United States and China. The USA increased its military spending for the third straight year to reach $778 billion in 2020,\u201d as compared with China\u2019s increase to $252 billion. In fourth place, below India, is the second U.S. adversary, Russia: $61.7 billion. The figures are instructive, but misleading. The U.S. is alone in facing no credible security threats. The threats that are invoked in the calls for even more military spending are at the borders of adversaries, which are ringed with U.S. nuclear-armed missiles in some of the 800 U.S. military bases around the world (China has one, Djibouti). Further threats, in this case quite real, are the development of new and more dangerous weapons systems. They could be banned by treaties, which were effective, until they were mostly dismantled by Bush II and Trump. The current mythology concocted to justify escalation of this suicidal enterprise is carefully dismantled by nuclear physicist Lawrence Krauss, who for many years had the responsibility to present publicly the setting of the Clock. He also reminds us that \u201cthe US and Russia have both come within seconds of launching nuclear weapons due to software or human errors that erroneously indicated an incoming nuclear missile strike\u201d and now have \u201cmore than 5,000 nuclear weapons each, with more than 1,000 of these on high alert, launch-on-warning status\u201d just waiting for another accident or human decision. That might be by someone well down the chain of command, as we learned from Daniel Ellsberg in his essential book,TheDoomsday Machine. The bloated military budget could be sharply cut without harm to authentic security \u2014 in fact enhancing genuine security if undertaken as a project of international cooperation, which is not an idle dream as history reveals. That would free up badly needed funds for urgent necessities. But it is not to be. The military budget remains untouchable, the example of the cherished ideal of bipartisanship. For some, it is not enough. Three influential Republican senators have just introduced an amendment to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill (BIP) now being debated, calling for another $50 billion for the \u201cundernourished\u201d Pentagon. One consequence is a substantial contribution to environmental destruction: recent studies show that \u201cthe US military is one of the largest polluters in history, consuming more liquid fuels and emitting more climate-changing gases than most medium-sized countries.\u201d That brings us to the one comparable threat to survival of organized human life: environmental destruction. In this case, unlike the nuclear menace, there is at least discussion and sometimes even corrective action, though nowhere near what is urgently needed. For years, scientists have been warning of a \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d Thousands more are joining the call as the world is swept with disasters intensified by heating the atmosphere. A few weeks ago, we reviewed recent discoveries that show, once again, that the dire predictions of earlier studies were too conservative. Inexorably, the grim tale continues to unfold. To mention a few more recent examples, new research has found that thawing of permafrost in rapidly heating Siberia may be releasing the \u201cmethane time bomb\u201d that scientists have long feared \u2014 a rapid release of massive quantities of methane, which is not as long-lasting as carbon dioxide (CO2) but far more destructive. The main surprise is that the release is from hard rock, not wetlands, as previously anticipated. The lead researcher cautions that data are still uncertain; interpreting it correctly, he says, \u201cmay make the difference between catastrophe and apocalypse\u201d as the climate crisis worsens. Those are in fact the likely alternatives on our current course. An accompanying report calls for a \u201cglobal state of emergency\u201d as temperatures continue to climb in Siberia and other Arctic regions. \u201cScientists have been shocked that the warm weather conducive to permafrost thawing is occurring roughly 70 years ahead of model projections,\u201d the study warns. \u201cThe story is simple,\u201d the report concludes. \u201cClimate change is happening faster than anticipated. One consequence \u2014 the loss of ice in the polar regions \u2014 is also a driver for more rapid global heating and disastrously rapid global sea level rise.\u201d Turning elsewhere, new studies find alarming signs of collapse in major ocean currents that regulate global climates, possibly with an impact on the Gulf Stream, all with incalculable but likely far-reaching effects. If we return to the topic in a few weeks, there will be more unpleasant news. Meanwhile, political leaders dither, or even act to amplify the threats. That is the state of threats to survival \u2014 threats that could be overcome in a world of rational deliberation and judgment; we know the means. That brings us to the third factor in the advance of the Doomsday Clock to midnight: the decline of rationality. Illustrations are so numerous that any small sample will be hopelessly misleading. The most extreme form of irrationality is flat denial of what you don\u2019t like. In the case of nuclear weapons and climate, the word \u201cdenial\u201d translates asDoom, and not in the distant future. Lesser examples illustrate the depths to which the malady has penetrated. One example has to do with nuclear weapons in the Middle East, an obsession of the political class and the media for years. Anyone in the vicinity of the real world knows that Israel has a substantial arsenal of nuclear weapons and that there is universal agreement among intelligence agencies that Iran has none. Trump didn\u2019t get his \u201cbeautiful wall,\u201d but in protection of beliefs from reality, it may not be needed. Polls reveal that \u201cmore Americans think Iran possesses nuclear weapons than think Israel does ... 60.5%, including 70.6% of Republicans and 52.6% of Democrats, say Iran possesses nuclear weapons \u2014 compared to 51.7% who say Israel does, including 51.7% of Republicans and 51.9% of Democrats.\u201d We have frequently discussed the obvious solution to the concern that Iran might develop nuclear weapons: a nuclear weapons-free zone (NWFZ) in the Middle East. In that case, there would be no constant tensions, no threat of major war, no murderous sanctions that the world must honor or be thrown out of the U.S.-run global financial system. In short, an ideal solution. few weeks ago, it seemed that there was finally a convert: the editorial board ofThe New York Times, who concluded that, \u201cIdeally, the result [of current negotiations] would be a nuclear-weapons-free zone in the Middle East.\u201d The editors acknowledge that there are some problems, not least \u201cIsrael\u2019s unacknowledged and nonnegotiable possession of nuclear weapons\u201d \u2014 also unacknowledged by the U.S. to avoid the embarrassment of opening the question of the status of U.S. military aid to Israel under American law. Unmentioned is that Washington has unilaterally blocked moves toward the \u201cideal\u201d solution for these reasons (notably Obama). And that the U.S. has some means to pressure Israel when it cares to, wielded by all pre-Obama presidents. The editorial also states that there is an African NWFZ, failing to mention that it cannot go into effect because of the U.S. military base in Diego Garcia, part of Mauritius in Africa according to the World Court, the United Nations and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. But not according to the U.S. and its British client, which claims the island in order to provide Washington with the base. Meanwhile the U.S.-U.K. righteously proclaim their leadership of the \u201crules-based international order\u201d challenged by forces of evil. Defiance of law is no minor matter in this case, not only for the expelled inhabitants and Mauritius, but also for the targets of U.S. bombing in the Middle East and Central Asia. Nevertheless, at least the \u201cideal\u201d solution is on the table, though it will plainly be a long struggle to free the public mind from the impressive grip of propaganda. In a different domain, the gap between prevailing invented reality and old-fashioned reality is illustrated by the fealty of the Republican voting base to, for many of them, their bitter enemy. Under Trump, the one legislative achievement of the self-declared party of the working man was the tax scam to enrich the very rich and harm the rest that we\u2019ve already discussed. The practice nowextends to the BIP. It has to be funded somehow. \u201cCongressional Republicans objected to tax hikes on the rich or corporations, while also eventually ruling out other measures proposed by the White House, such as stepped-up IRS enforcement on tax cheats. The White House, meanwhile, ruled out higher taxes on Americans earning under $400,000, including a proposed gas tax.\u201d An instructive impasse. Another illustration of deep loyalty, well reported, is the \u201cstolen election\u201d charade, still upheld by nearly two-thirds of Republicans. more subtle though highly consequential case is vaccine rejection, persisting in the face of overwhelming evidence of the efficacy of the vaccines and the grave danger of refusal. The danger, of course, is not limited to the refuser. On a sufficient scale, refusal will prevent herd immunity so that the plague will persist, and worse, will expedite mutations that may reach beyond control. Inquiry has identified many factors in refusal. A careful statistical study by Anthony DiMaggio reveals that the culprit, for once, is notFox News, which has had no statistically significant effect on refusal. Rather, the most salient sector is Republicans confined to social media bubbles, already primed for distrust of science by decades of right-wing propaganda. Refusal is no small matter. Nearly 60 percent of Republicans say they are unwilling to get vaccinated. Meanwhile, Republican leaders continue to oppose vaccine requirements, arguing that it\u2019s up to the individual \u2014 whatever the lethal effect on others. The most outspoken is the new heroine of the party, Marjorie Taylor Greene, whose fans cheered when she heralded the low vaccination rate in Alabama, which tossed 65,000 unused doses \u2014 badly needed elsewhere \u2014 in the midst of another sharp spike in cases. This is the barest sample. The task of restoring a measure of rationality is daunting, and a responsibility that cannot be shirked."

Human agency is essential for achieving progressive social change. Almost invariably, it crucially involves collective action. The great historian and activist Howard Zinn dedicated his life\u2019s work to \u201cthe countless small actions of unknown people\u201d that lie at the roots of \u201cthose great moments\u201d that enter the historical record, small actions almost always undertaken in concert. Labor historian Eric Loomis adds the crucial qualification that the labor actions that have commonly been in the forefront of the struggle for a better world have achieved success when a sympathetic administration contained state-business violence. The usual path to success is a combination of radical goals and pragmatic choice of tactics, but there cannot be a general formula for the proper course."

    "input": "Looking at the state of the contemporary United States, one is struck by the nearly simultaneous explosion of two highly contradictory phenomena \u2014 white supremacist ideology and a new civil rights or social justice movement known as Black Lives Matter, respectively. How do you assess the historical significance of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, and do you see it as a pragmatic or a radical response to the plague of systemic racism?",
    "output": "Black Lives Matter has proven to be a highly significant social movement. The \u201csimultaneous explosion\u201d is real, and not too surprising. BLM is an activist manifestation of a long overdue reckoning with a shameful past and its bitter surviving legacy. Many want that history erased, and its legacy ignored. One salient reason, it seems, is fear of the \u201cGreat Replacement.\u201d It\u2019s easy to scoff at Great Replacement absurdities, and to condemn the demagogues and cynics who exploit them for their ugly purposes. But it\u2019s not hard to see why they appeal to parts of the population \u2014 mostly rural, white, Christian, less educated, relatively affluent, often tending toward white supremacist commitments and Christian nationalism. The absurdities resonate because they rest on a core of fact: Those who have survived under the jackboot for centuries are demanding basic rights and are receiving more general support. BLM and its broad outreach have significantly advanced this cause. The \u201ctraditional way of life\u201d that rests on denying these rights is facing threats, including demographic realities. It\u2019s not necessary here to trace how these conflicts have poisoned American society from its origins. They remain virulent, unpredictable, affecting many aspects of life and the social order."

    "input": "noticeable change is also being observed among a growing segment of American citizens, from both political parties, with regard to attitudes toward Israel and the Palestinians. How significant is this shift in public opinion, and how do we explain it?",
    "output": "Highly significant, and unmistakable. The poll I cited earlier on the astonishing perception of Middle East nuclear weapons found that the latest Israeli assault on Gaza \u201cappears to have led to the largest increase to date in the number of Democrats, especially young Democrats, who want the U.S. to lean toward the Palestinians.\u201d Each of the murderous Israeli assaults on Gaza has had that effect. The regular crimes of settlers and the army in the West Bank mostly pass under the radar. But the longtime tendency is very clear. In earlier years, even at moments where there was some recognition of the brutality of Israeli crimes, in the eyes of liberal America, Israel remained \u201ca society in which moral sensitivity is a principle of political life\u201d and which \u201cthrough its tumultuous history\u201d has been animated by \u201chigh moral purpose\u201d (New York Times, Time, fall 1982, at the peak of condemnation of Israeli crimes after the Sabra-Shatila massacres). That has changed. Now support for Israel has shifted to Evangelical Christians, right-wing nationalists and military-security sectors. The shift largely traces the drift to the ultranationalist right within Israel, along with the increasing difficulty of covering up its brutal actions and increased sensibility on a broad scale in the U.S. The shift among the population has so far had little impact on policy, in fact runs counter to it. Obama was more supportive of Israel than his predecessors, even if not sufficiently so for the ascendant far right in Israel. Trump pulled out all the stops. Biden, so far, has scarcely modified his extremist stance. If the growing opposition to Israeli crimes crystallizes into an effective solidarity movement, it could bring about significant changes in U.S. policy. That could not fail to have major effects in Israel, which has been dependent on U.S. protection since the 1970s, when the Labor governments made the fateful decision to reject live diplomatic options, choosing instead expansion and construction of Greater Israel in violation of UN Security Council orders and international law."

    "input": "The so-called radical wing of the Democratic Party, which is most vocally represented by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is coming under rather enigmatic criticism, at least as far as I am concerned, by various left-minded groups and individuals for allegedly not doing enough to push forward a radical agenda of social change, which includes, among other things, Medicare for All. How justified is this criticism considering that the so-called radical wing of the Democratic Party consists of just a handful of individuals, which means that they obviously lack the power to be movers and shakers in Washington, D.C.?",
    "output": "Much of the criticism seems to me misguided in two respects: First, it focuses on alleged failures to achieve what is beyond reach under existing circumstances; and second, and more significant, it largely ignores very serious failures to achieve what is well within reach, and crucial for survival. In the first category, it makes very good sense to strongly advocate for Medicare for All and other measures that would bring the U.S. into the \u201ccivilized\u201d world, and enable it to realize its potential to become a leading force for progress, as it was in many ways in the New Deal years. It is a stunning fact that despite its unique advantages, the United States ranks last among the rich societies in health care. The most recent international study of 11 high-income countries finds that, \u201cThe United States ranks last overall, despite spending far more of its gross domestic product on health care. The U.S. ranks last on access to care, administrative efficiency, equity, and health care outcomes, but second on measures of care process.\u201d This scandal is mirrored in other measures of social justice. And efforts to overcome it are imperative. Choice of measures to do so has to begin with assessment of social and political reality. The reality is that the levers of power are in the hands of concentrated wealth, the corporate world and their political representatives. The labor movement has been severely weakened by the neoliberal assault, and other popular movements are in no position to challenge concentrated political-economic power even when their goals are backed by a majority of the population. The Republican half of the Senate is opposed, rock solid, to change that impinges on the welfare of their actual constituency of private wealth and corporate power (posturing aside). Simply look at their conditions on funding the BIP. And enough (so-called moderate) Democrats go along with them to block progressive legislation. Vigorous advocacy should continue, accompanying the educational and organizational work that is needed to overcome dominant reactionary forces. It is idle, however, to direct criticism to a scattered few for failing to do what cannot be done until this foundational work is accomplished. To do that work is the proper task for the critics. The second category of criticisms, which is largely lacking, should be directed at failures to undertake actions that are within reach and are of immense significance. I have already mentioned one: sharply cutting the Pentagon budget. A related concern is provocative foreign policy stances, dangerous and readily avoided in favor of diplomacy. Keeping just to the domestic scene, there is a great deal that merits serious critical attention. The major Biden initiative is the BIP. As the business press reports, referring to climate policy, \u201cmost of Biden\u2019s plans for radical change can\u2019t be found anywhere\u201d in the bill. The \u201cradical\u201d proposals that can\u2019t be found are in fact moderate measures that are essential for escape from catastrophe. The few progressives in Congress, backed by Sunrise Movement, have said they will not vote for the BIP unless Congress moves on a subsequent legislation that includes the full range of necessary proposals. The fate of the contemplated larger bill is very much in doubt. While this failure is receiving at least some attention, there is more that is passing in silence and is truly ominous.APreports that, \u201cApprovals for companies to drill for oil and gas on U.S. public lands are on pace this year to reach their highest level since George W. Bush was president, underscoring President Joe Biden\u2019s reluctance to more forcefully curb petroleum production in the face of industry and Republican resistance.\u201d The reference is to reserves already under lease but not authorized. While there are legal issues about blocking prior leases, there seems to be plenty of room for executive action. Much had been hoped for from Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who while in Congress had adamantly opposed drilling on federal lands and opposed fracking, and had co-sponsored the original Green New Deal. But the signs so far are hardly encouraging \u2014 and one can\u2019t reiterate often enough that there is not much time. In this domain, critical commentary is well warranted. And even more so, direct engagement and action."

Biden is promising to heal and unite the nation. Does Chomsky think this can actually happen?",
    "output": "\u201cWe\u2019re going in both directions,\u201d he responds. \u201cThere\u2019s much more sensitivity to racial oppression today than there was in the past. Take the response to the George Floyd murder [last May]. There have been murders of Blacks by the police forever, but this was unique. Within days you had mass protests as well as Black and white solidarity all over the country, and enormous popular support \u2013 something Martin Luther King Jr. never reached. This is a sign of change,\u201d he says. But Chomsky also believes there\u2019s a fierce backlash among other Americans that must not be ignored. \u201cYou have the Republican Party and their voters, [who] are largely white, Christian and traditional from rural America. And what\u2019s their main concern? That their traditional way of life is under attack. And what\u2019s their traditional way of life? Keeping their jackboot on the necks of Blacks,\u201d he states. \u201cIf you look at the birth rate in the U.S. right now, the majority are non-white,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to know the statistics to know what that means. They will lose the white supremacy. The concept of being white is not a race concept, but rather sociological. If you go back, not very far, Jews were not considered white. Neither were the Irish. In late-19th century Boston, you could find signs at restaurants saying \u201cNo dogs or Irish.\u201d They gradually became white as they assimilated into the culture, especially when they gained wealth and political power. And that\u2019s now happening with the Hispanic population,\u201d Chomsky believes. Every four years, the merits of the Electoral College system are vigorously debated. Chomsky is one of many who believe the system is flawed and outdated. \u201cWe\u2019re facing a constitutional crisis. You can see it in this election. Biden is winning by more than 3 million votes [currently over 5 million], but nobody even looks at that. We\u2019re still living with a system that was created by wealthy white slave owners,\u201d he says. Biden\u2019s Middle East policy On foreign policy, Chomsky is also far from convinced that Biden will bring sweeping change of the kind progressives are seeking. He does think Biden will rejoin the Iran nuclear deal from which Trump withdrew in May 2018. But he has no expectations of Biden promoting a nuclear arms-free Middle East \u2013 something that would require a confrontation with Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple: just join the rest of the world. If you do that, you reconstitute the deal,\u201d Chomsky says regarding Iran. \u201cEven if the U.S. isn\u2019t a trustworthy partner, Iran would probably still be well advised to join the deal. But notice, there\u2019s another point that\u2019s so untouchable, nobody is willing to discuss it. There\u2019s a very simple solution to the problem of Iranian nuclear weapons: Impose a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle East with intensive inspections.\u201d says such inspections work \u201ccontrary to Israeli propaganda. The Arab states and Iran have been calling for a nuclear weapons-free zone for a long time. In fact, the majority of the countries in the world support it. So why isn\u2019t it instituted? Because the U.S. vetoes it. The most recent veto was by Obama, simply because Washington doesn\u2019t want Israeli nuclear weapons to be inspected. \u201cThe U.S. doesn\u2019t recognize that Israel has nuclear weapons, even though everyone knows they do. And there\u2019s a reason for that too \u2013 it\u2019s called American law, which bans any military or economic aid to states that have developed nuclear weapons outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty,\u201d Chomsky says. Israel\u2019s policy of ambiguity about its alleged nuclear weapons is considered a key component of its national security doctrine. Netanyahu, for his part, is also concerned that after benefiting politically over the past four years from his close relationship with Trump, he could now pay a political price at home for any tensions with the incoming Biden administration. Chomsky, once again, is skeptical that any large-scale change will take place in America\u2019s Middle East policy. \u201cLet\u2019s assume Biden goes back to Obama\u2019s policies. Contrary to what many Israelis think, Obama was the most pro-Israel president prior to Trump. He never imposed any demands on Israel. Israel\u2019s settlement freeze in 2010 under Obama was a complete farce. And everyone knows it. The Israeli press reported correctly that it had no effect. Instead of building new settlements, they called it expansion,\u201d Chomsky argues. The Palestinians, on the other hand, are looking forward to ending four years of hostility between Ramallah and Washington. \u201cThere is hope for the Palestinians, but it doesn\u2019t lie with Biden,\u201d Chomsky says. \u201cIt lies with the public opinion in the U.S., which can\u2019t be suppressed forever. If you go back 20 years, the support for Israel would be among liberal democrats. Now it\u2019s shifting to evangelicals and ultranationalists. And support for Palestinians is growing among liberals \u2013 especially the young ones. Sooner or later that might influence policy.\u201d"

As you know, I fought with the YPG in 2017 against ISIS in northeast Syria. Today, the United States is still illegally occupying northeast Syria while imposing brutal sanctions on the Syrian people. What is your perspective on Syria and the Kurdish question?",
    "output": "Well, the United States pretty much abandoned the Kurds in Rojava after they had served the purpose of the United States. [They] had provided basically the ground forces for driving out ISIS and suffered over 10,000 killed. Then President Trump just told them to get lost and handed them over to the Turks, their most bitter enemy, who proceeded to move in and drive them out and slaughter them. They\u2019re holding out for the time being. The sanctions on Syria are brutal and destructive. Sanctions generally attack the civilian population. They have no effect on the leadership. They\u2019re murderous and brutal. That\u2019s what sanctions are like. The sanctions on Iraq, for example, devastated the country. [They] didn\u2019t harm Saddam Hussein, and his coterie, in fact, it probably strengthened them because the population had to rely on them for survival. In fact, they might have been overthrown from within if it hadn\u2019t been for the sanctions. Well, we\u2019re seeing that again in Syria, as we see it in other places. It\u2019s a horrible situation. It\u2019s hard to see anything good, almost anywhere."

    "input": "CH: Thinking of the state of the U.S. empire today and the anti-imperialist movement, do you have a theory of imperialism? What does imperialism mean for you today? Is anti-imperialism still relevant?",
    "output": "These general terms of political theory are really not terribly useful. It doesn\u2019t make sense to try to define them. You can look at particular cases and describe them, figure out what the factors are. What term you decide to use for them isn\u2019t all that important. The current stage of American global domination has many factors, many. One of them, concerning Syria in the Middle East region, is the one significant geostrategic initiative that was undertaken by the Trump administration and so far, is being pursued by Biden. Trump, he probably didn\u2019t know it but whoever was planning for him, had the idea of constructing a reactionary international, of the most reactionary states in the world run from Washington. In the Middle East that would include the family dictatorships of the Gulf, Israel, which has moved very far to the right, and any other right wing extreme forces that they could find. Moving to the East, includes Modi\u2019s India. Modi\u2019s busy crushing Kashmir, destroying Indian secular democracy. Obvious candidate in the western hemisphere is the proto-fascist, destructive tyrant Bolsonaro in Brazil. Orban in Hungary and a couple of others. The main target is Iran, not because of the ugliness of the state, which indeed is very ugly but the US tolerates the same or worse elsewhere. But because Iran is the one country in the region which is not succumbing to U.S. power and that can\u2019t be tolerated. Therefore, it\u2019s an enemy that has to be destroyed. When Israel talks about Iran being an existential threat, and that\u2019s echoed in the US media commentary, what that means is Iran is a deterrent to Israel\u2019s initiatives to rampage freely in the region. Iran is in the way. Actually, US intelligence says the same thing about Iran. They say the threat of Iran is that it\u2019s a deterrent. If Iran were to develop nuclear weapons, according to US intelligence, they would be part of its deterrence strategy. Of course, they\u2019re not going to use them, in which case they\u2019d be wiped out in three seconds. But they are a deterrent, and countries that want to rampage freely don\u2019t want to tolerate deterrence. So, Iran is an enemy and has to be destroyed. Looking around the world, it\u2019s a dangerous situation. The Biden administration has had pretty reasonable domestic policies, better than I expected, but on foreign policy, it\u2019s very dangerous. They have undertaken unnecessary, provocative actions where diplomacy is in order with regard to China and Russia. Biden has basically continued Trump\u2019s policy with regard to Iran. Some nicer words but the policy is the same. The US pulled out of the joint agreement in violation of Security Council orders, but it\u2019s Iran\u2019s responsibility to initiate a return. Biden, following Trump, says the return must be to a new agreement, not the joint agreement, but a much harsher one. Essentially, Trump\u2019s policy. That\u2019s leading to very serious threats and dangers, which could be easily dealt with. In other areas, there is a problem in the South China Sea. Undoubtedly, China is undertaking actions which are in violation of international court decisions. They\u2019re trying to establish in the seas off their coast, what the United States establishes all over the world. Of course, the US doesn\u2019t want to accept that. It wants total control, not just control of the Eastern Pacific, but also the South China Sea. So, there\u2019s a conflict. The answer to the conflict is not to send a naval armada into the South China Sea, but to move towards negotiations and diplomacy to try to work it out together with the other countries in the region who would much prefer a diplomatic settlement than a war which would destroy everyone. The provocative actions with Russia are similar. Not that Russia is blameless by any means, but the answer is not more provocation on the Russian border. Biden has done some good things. He managed to salvage the new START agreement. Russia had been calling for negotiations to resolve and continue the last of the arms control regime. Trump managed to destroy all the rest of it, but one part was left, the new START agreement, which limits the number of missiles. It\u2019s mostly symbolic, but important. Biden did rescue it literally within hours of its expiration. It was due to expire on February 5th (2021). So that was good. But in foreign policy, it\u2019s hard to find anything else. I mean, he has eliminated some of the more savage and brutal, gratuitously brutal, elements of Trump\u2019s policies, like punishing the Palestinians in Gaza who were barely surviving. According to Trump, you have to punish them by taking away the little support they have because they weren\u2019t grateful enough to him for selling Palestinians down the river. Okay, Biden relaxed on that now. Restored some of the aid from before, so it\u2019s less savage, less brutal, but not very different."

    "input": "CH: In 2015 I was honored to see you and Dr. Mads Gilbert together at MIT speaking on Palestine. Since then, so much has changed and worsened for the Palestinians. What is your perspective on Palestine today? Is the two-state solution still viable or do we have to envision some other alternative, like a one-state solution?",
    "output": "Well, I\u2019ve been in favor of a one-state solution all my life, but it\u2019s not enough to be in favor of it. It has to be feasible. At the moment, it\u2019s just not an option. Israel will never agree to go out of existence and become a minority Jewish population in a Palestinian state. Just simple as that. If they had to, they would use nuclear weapons to prevent it. It\u2019s just not an option. What you can do is begin to move towards some sort of integration of the societies. But the problem with that is Israel doesn\u2019t want it. Israel is dedicated to the Greater Israel policy [Eretz Yisrael Ha-Shlema] that has been pursued relentlessly for over 50 years. The idea is to take over in the West Bank everything of any value and leave the population to somehow survive if they can. So actually, Israel doesn\u2019t want to take over Nablus, doesn\u2019t want Palestinian population concentrations, wants to get rid of the Palestinians, not to incorporate them. So, it doesn\u2019t take Nablus, it doesn\u2019t take Tulkarm. Palestinians everywhere are left in about 160 isolated enclaves surrounded by checkpoints cut off from their fields and olive groves and pasture. If they can survive somehow it\u2019s their business, or otherwise just leave. That\u2019s the policy, and it\u2019s not hidden. You can see it right in front of your eyes. The Israeli settlers in Ma\u2019ale Adumim, right in the middle of the West Bank, don\u2019t even know they\u2019re in Palestine. They think they\u2019re in Israel. They get subsidized housing, health care, even better than living in Israel because they get their housing and maintenance subsidized. They ride on superhighways to their jobs in Tel Aviv. They wouldn\u2019t even know there\u2019s a Palestinian around. That\u2019s the policy that\u2019s being implemented. Meanwhile, they sort of dangle two states as an option, but one state is just not an option Now the hope for the Palestinians, I think, is actually in the United States. If the United States were to change its policies even slightly, that would have a big effect and it could happen. What\u2019s happening in the United States is interesting to see. It\u2019s important. You go back to 10 or 15 years, support for Israel was the darling of the liberal community. You could say no wrong about Israel. Couldn\u2019t even give talks about it. Meetings would be broken up, needed police protection, that sort of thing. That\u2019s all changed. Liberal Americans now actually are more supportive of Palestinians than of Israel. Support for Israel has shifted to the far-right. It\u2019s based in the Republican Party, of course, in the evangelical community for the wrong reasons. Many of them anti-Semitic reasons. The far-right nationalists, the military industries, security industries and so on. Well, that could sooner or later lead to a change in policy. In fact, if there were serious activist groups in the United States working on this, I think the terrain is possible. So, for example, there are real soft spots which the mainstream tries to cover up. I\u2019ll take you to Iran again. The Iranian nuclear program is supposed to be the biggest threat in the world. There is a very simple way of stopping them. Namely, institute a nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East. Everybody\u2019s in favor of it. Iran is strongly in favor of it. The Arab states are in favor of it. Global south is in favor of it. Europe has no objections. The one barrier is the United States won\u2019t permit it. Obama vetoed it every time it came up. The reason is perfectly obvious. The United States does not want Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons to be inspected. In fact, the United States does not even officially recognize their existence. There is a reason for that too. Under American law, U.S. aid to Israel is arguably illegal because of Israel\u2019s development of nuclear weapons outside the framework of international agreements. None of the political parties, neither of them wants to open that door. Mainstream commentators don\u2019t want to, either. But the American people would be concerned if they knew about that, all across the spectrum in fact. Plenty of say, my right-wing neighbors here in Arizona wouldn\u2019t like the idea of paying billions of dollars to Israel to conceal the fact that U.S. aid is illegal. There is plenty of room for activism on that. It\u2019s not being done. There are other things, they\u2019re just not being done. But it\u2019s an opportunity. Even a mild threat in the United States to reduce military aid would have a big impact. It could put some form of two-state settlement back on the agenda. It\u2019s not there now, but it could be. That could be a step towards the kind of interactions, erosion of borders, commercial cultural interactions, which could lead to a unitary Israel-Palestine, maybe a federation of some sort. I think those things are all conceivable."

    "input": "CH: Do you think there\u2019s a place for Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) in the struggle for Palestine?",
    "output": "It could be if it were directed. The BDS movement could be important. The problem is that it\u2019s wedded to a catechism, and it cannot think tactically. There\u2019s a catechism handed down originally by Omar Barghouti, has three things, have to keep to those, can\u2019t think of anything else. So, you can\u2019t bring up what I just discussed because that\u2019s not in the catechism. Now, if you look at the catechism, part of it makes sense. Boycott. There are no sanctions, of course, but a boycott of anything related to the occupation is a very effective tactic. You can bring in lots of support. It\u2019s got a simple basis, even in international law. Overwhelming support. So, you focus on that, and you get somewhere. Soon as you bring up say, calling for all refugees to return, you\u2019re finished. Everyone knows it\u2019s not going to happen. Secondly, it just is a gift to the Zionist right wing. It says \u201cOh look, a bunch of anti-Semites who want to destroy Israel by letting hordes of Palestinians come in.\u201d I mean if you\u2019re a serious activist organization you don\u2019t pick tactics which are suicidal. It\u2019s as simple as that. Saying the third element of the catechism, \u201cwe\u2019re going to boycott Israel until they have equal rights for Palestinians within Israel,\u201d actually, that\u2019s a good point. But it immediately directs attention away from the Palestinians because the reaction is predictable, and we\u2019ve seen it over and over. Why single out Israel? Why not your own country, which has plenty of repression and violence? So, if you\u2019re singling out Israel it\u2019s because you\u2019re anti-Semitic? So, let\u2019s have rules blocking your activities because they\u2019re anti-Semitic. And the next thing is you fight the rules and so on. Meanwhile, forget about the Palestinians. It\u2019s a crazy tactic. I mean, you know, if you want to get somewhere, you adjust your tactics, so they\u2019re going to work. Not so that they\u2019re going to undermine your efforts. So, I think the boycott of anything connected with the occupation makes very good sense. That was actually initiated in the 1990s by Uri Avnery and his Gush Shalom organization in Israel. Some have picked it up. The Presbyterian Church, a major institution in the US does follow that. That makes sense. As long as the BDS movement does that, they\u2019re helpful. When they go in other directions, it\u2019s harmful. It moves attention away from the Palestinians to issues like academic freedom or hypocrisy or anti-Semitism. That\u2019s of no help to the Palestinians to move attention over in those directions. There are opportunities being lost like the one I mentioned, which could have a lot of appeal."

    "output": "It\u2019s a repressive, authoritarian state. On major issues like global warming, it\u2019s a mixed story. It\u2019s always called the highest polluter in the world. That\u2019s not quite accurate. In per capita terms, which is the only relevant measure, it\u2019s way below the United States. But it\u2019s instituting more coal plants and shouldn\u2019t be doing that. On the other hand, it\u2019s way ahead internationally in renewable energy. Not only in scale, but even in quality and it\u2019s increasing. We should be cooperating with it on that. We should be cooperating with them on issues of common concern. One of them is global warming. It\u2019s an international issue. They have a mixed record. We have a mixed record. In fact, [we have] one of the worst records. We could get together with them to improve the global situation. Same is true of international conflict. Take the major issue of repression, that\u2019s getting huge publicity in the United States. The reeducation camps for one million Uyghurs. That\u2019s clearly severe human rights abuses. But how about being honest about it? I mean, is the situation of the Uyghurs worse than the situation in Gaza. Two million Gazans, twice that many people facing virtual destruction. No potable water, Israeli attacks destroying sewage plants. Barely surviving under constant attack of one sort or another. The difference between that case and the Uyghur case is that we can do something about it. In fact, we could end it. In the case of the Uyghurs, we can complain about it. That\u2019s a very consistent pattern. I\u2019ve written reams about it. My colleague and friend, the late Ed Herman, did tons of work on it. Case after case of what we called the difference between worthy and unworthy victims. The worthy victims are the victims of someone else, an enemy that we can\u2019t do anything about. That\u2019s worthy victims. The unworthy victims are our victims, which we can do everything about. So therefore, you scream and lament about the other guy\u2019s crimes while you suppress your own. How much have you read about the fact that we could end the torture of Gaza, two million people have children, if we wanted to. Can\u2019t find that in the newspapers. It\u2019s much better to express your outrage over the reeducation camps in China. So, what\u2019s the sense of China? A lot wrong, seriously wrong. A lot right. Take the COVID pandemic. I mean, you look at the total number of deaths in China. It\u2019s not much more than the daily deaths in the United States. I mean, they contained it. Maybe 5,000 deaths since the beginning, unlike other countries. Well, that\u2019s important. We want to know how they did it. You don\u2019t call it \u201cKung Flu\u201d or \u201cChinese Flu.\u201d You try to work constructively with them. Not that there\u2019s a lovely government, it isn\u2019t.

    "output": "Well, the Black Panthers, who I actually worked with pretty closely back in those years, were a mixed story. Actually, there were very few Black Panthers. According to the FBI, there were eight hundred. They were a major target. The major target of FBI repression. In fact, they were wiped out by FBI repression and the FBI went after [them]. As I said, they were mixed. Some of them were serious organizers working in the community, doing very good things. Other members were basically thugs. Criminal elements making use of it. The FBI didn\u2019t care about the criminal elements. They went after the organizers, the good people. Sometimes they just murdered them like Fred Hampton in a Gestapo-style assassination. One of the most effective Panther organizers. They were under such attack and pressure that it\u2019s very hard to discuss what they could have been. They could have been a major important organization. It was so-called Black nationalism altogether [that] was under very severe attack under the COINTELPRO monstrosities, the worst repression in American history. A program of the national political police to wipe out all criticism and dissent. In fact, the entire New Left, [including] the women\u2019s movement, was under attack. It concentrated on the Black population. Very destructive [and] demoralizing to the whole Black community. Well, Black Lives Matter has been very successful. They\u2019ve done the right kinds of activism and organizing. They have enormous public support. Popular movements like that never get any public support. Even before the Floyd murder, Black Lives Matter had about 50 percent public support, which is incredible. After the killing of Floyd, it went up to about two thirds. That\u2019s way beyond what Martin Luther King had at the peak of his popularity. They\u2019re doing basically good things. They could turn into a successful movement. If they move towards centralized control, democratic centralism, they are going to become another authoritarian movement. It\u2019s built into the structure. People like Rosa Luxemburg before her assassination were condemning the Bolsheviks for moving in that direction. It was critical support. She was supportive of what they were doing but warned that these Leninist moves towards centralization were going to wipe out democratic participation and the hopeful elements in the revolutionary struggle. I see Trotsky had even condemned Lenin for that years earlier. In 1905, the left-wing of the Marxist movement, correctly, was quite critical of these centralizing moves. The kind of slogan that they used was \u201cthe party will take control over the proletariat, the central committee will take control over the party, and maximal leadership will take control over the central committee.\u201d That\u2019s what we see happening over and over. The Bolshevik Revolution was a case in point. I think these are the wrong directions to move in. The directions to move in should be participatory, democratic, moving towards freedom, mutual aid, mutual support. The constructive activities. Plenty of room for that."

Out of that comes Biden\u2019s program. Now, you\u2019re right \u2014 it takes skills that turn it into a legislative program. But those skills are not going to be exercised unless there is pressure from the grassroots to make it happen. Jeff Bezos, the owner of Amazon, says he is in favor of Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ rights, women\u2019s rights. Yet the one progressive cause he will not support is the right to have a union in any of his workplaces. If you want to know about his attitude towards women, take a look at an Amazon warehouse. Working conditions are horrendous. If you want to see his attitudes towards working people, take a look at the people who do deliveries. His system is carefully constructed so that the drivers delivering goods are not his employees. They are run by small companies that contract to Amazon, which means that they can have horrible wages and surveillance to make sure that drivers race as fast as possible to where they are going. And Jeff Bezos can say, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it; they are not my employees.\u201d Bezos opposes unions because they are the one way in which workers can defend themselves from predators like Jeff Bezos."

Did part of the left\u2019s critical approach also contribute to a distrust of the media and our political institutions?",
    "output": "The left, including me, have been highly critical of the media for a long time. It\u2019s not that they tell lies. It\u2019s that the institutional structure of the media leads to the framing of news and choice of topics, which gives you a distorted picture of the world in many respects. The kind of critique you are talking about with QAnon has a basis in that lots of people\u2019s lives have really been harmed. Take a trip through rural America where independent farmers are mostly gone. Go through rural towns where houses are for sale and businesses are boarded up. When you have conditions like that, people get angry and resentful. The growth of QAnon does not seem to me to be reducible to economics, but rather stems from a psychological need to feel that you have access to esoteric knowledge that renders you special. Right, you did not find that type of thing when I was a child in the \u201930s, when the labor movement was organizing. There was a sense that we could move ahead together. You get QAnon when people see things falling apart. That\u2019s the difference between organized, effective activism and a society in dissolution. What I was suggesting is that when both right and left assert that our major social and political institutions are primarily repositories of malevolent power, this can be very corrosive for a society. Well, that\u2019s not my position. With Biden, for instance, there are very positive aspects to his program. To the extent that an organized, informed, dedicated public can influence policy, you can get institutions that are responsive to people\u2019s needs. Like the New Deal that changed lives enormously. The administration was responsive to organized popular pressures. It\u2019s not that the institutions are necessarily malevolent, but if they are dependent upon unaccountable private power, yes, of course they are going to be malevolent."

    "output": "Well, as you say that is a big \u201cif,\u201d but let\u2019s assume it happens. Then there are many factors that would have to be considered. One is what the character of Congress is. Let\u2019s also assume, and this is an even bigger \u201cif,\u201d that he carries a substantial majority of Congress with him. That\u2019s pretty hard to imagine, but let\u2019s suppose so. Then a lot would depend on the character, energy, and commitment of the popular movements that he\u2019s inspired and that, under these assumptions, would have been the factor that led him to victory. If they keep the pressure up, then things could happen. Unfortunately, the historic cutting-edge of popular activism is lacking in this case \u2014 namely, an organized labor movement. So if you look say at the New Deal in the 1930s, it was possible to achieve fairly significant reforms because there was a militant, energized labor movement which was pressing very hard. In fact, it was threatening corporate control of business and there was a sympathetic administration which responded to the pressure. That combination has been critical for just about every reform known in the past. There would be a question in the hypothetical case we are considering whether the labor movement could be revived to participate in these efforts. It\u2019s been badly beaten back both in the United States and Britain by the neoliberal assault since Reagan and Thatcher. There is also a question about whether the other popular movements that have developed in recent years, which are pretty significant, can fill the gap. I think those are the kinds of factors that would be essential to achieving anything. But we can be certain that concentrated capital will fight back vigorously. In fact, if we go back to the New Deal it is a complicated and interesting matter which has been studied in some detail and very insightfully by Thomas Ferguson, a fine political scientist. What he shows pretty convincingly is that during the New Deal there was a split within private capital. In general, more high-tech capital-intensive internationally oriented industries tended to support Roosevelt. Labor-intensive domestically oriented industries like the National Association of Manufacturers violently opposed Roosevelt. So there was an internal split which contributed to the success of the New Deal measures, along with the crucial element of very extensive and active and militant popular support, mostly from the labor movement."

    "input": "JC: You mentioned the importance of the labor movement which sadly is not as active as it was in previous decades. How does the labor movement, and the progressive left as a whole, address this weakness? Do you think there are internal contradictions or weaknesses within the movement itself which need addressing first before it is able to fight capital and big business?",
    "output": "First of all, we should mention and bear in mind thatMargaret Thatcherand the people around Reagan were not fools. They understood that it would be necessary to destroy the labor movements if they wanted to carry through the kinds of policies which were certain to harm the general population, as indeed they have done. If you want to see some contradictions within the labor movement, take a look at the front page of theNew York Timesrecently, which had a very interesting case. Bernie Sanders was campaigning in Nevada, and there was a conflict within the labor movement. One of the major unions [the Culinary Union, Local 226] wasstrongly opposedto Sanders\u2019s proposal for Medicare for All. That has to do with an interesting specificity of American labor history. So let\u2019s compare the United States and Canada, which are pretty similar societies. In fact, there\u2019s the same labor movements on both sides of the border. The United Auto Workers (UAW) is the same union on both sides. But they have a different mentality related to the culture and the nature of the societies. If you go back to the 1950s the UAW in Canada was militantly working for universal health care, what\u2019s called single-payer health care. That was achieved in part because of their militant commitment to it. So Canada now has a health care system of the kind common in developed societies. In the United States on the other hand, the same union \u2014 UAW \u2014 was struggling for health care for their own members, not for society. They were working out the deals with management in which they would sacrifice control of the workplace benefits. Management was willing to make these deals to keep the labor force quiet. So, union contracts often provide pretty decent health care for their own members, but not for society. The health care system in the United States is a disaster. It has about twice the per capita costs of other comparable countries with relatively poor outcomes. Sanders\u2019s program for general health care would help everyone and indeed cut back overall costs substantially. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily improve health care for the workers who have succeeded through their own narrow struggles in the workplace to achieve health care for themselves, and there was a split in the union over this. That\u2019s a factor that we have to consider. While unions were making deals with management for many years, they assumed that there was a compact between themselves and management. They learned better by 1980. Around that time the president of the UAW, Doug Fraser, resigned from a committee that President Carter was instituting. Fraser condemned management for fighting what he called \u201ca one-sided class war against the labor movement,\u201d which of course they had always been doing. Business never relents in its one-sided class war. If management decides that the deal is over, it\u2019s over. Doug Fraser realized that many years too late and the labor movement of course suffered from these class-collaboration policies. So yes, there are divisions in the labor movement and have been for a long time. There were reform movements within the major unions \u2014 steel workers, auto workers, and others \u2014 and there\u2019s been conflicts over this, but it\u2019s a situation that\u2019s not easy to resolve."

    "input": "JC: It\u2019s quite paradoxical because on the one hand the labor movement was built as a collective force, so that workers can secure what they couldn\u2019t secure individually. But on the other hand, it has become a bureaucratic system. How do you think this contradiction can be resolved?",
    "output": "Again, you have to look at the specific history of the United States, which is somewhat different from other industrial societies, even different from Canada. The United States happens to be to an unusual extent a business-run society with a highly class-conscious business community which is also always fighting a vicious class war. Look at the history of American labor, which is unusually violent. Hundreds of workers were being killed in labor actions in the United States when nothing like that was happening in England, Canada, France, and other similar countries. The labor movement in the past had been based on class solidarity and mutual support \u2014 support by one group of workers for another \u2014 and in fact to an extent that still remains. The union of longshoremen has, for example, refused to allow boats to dock if the countries were violently suppressing their own populations and labor forces. The US conservative business establishment understood early on that they must break that mutual support. You can see this immediately after the Second World War, when the business world mobilized to try to undermine the power of labor that had developed during the Depression and the war. One of the first reactions in 1947 was theTaft-Hartley Act, which for example, banned secondary pickets. Secondary pickets are a means of class solidarity. They happen when a union is on strike and another union helps them \u2014 that was made illegal. Actually, President Truman vetoed it, but the reservation was passed over his veto. There was a strong business backlash against the democratic forces that had developed in the previous decades. There is another special thing about the United States \u2014 the militant, almost hysterical, anti-Left propaganda. For example, McCarthyism, which is attributed to Joe McCarthy, though Truman actually is the one who started it. One of its aspects \u2014 the red-baiting \u2014 was to drive the militant labor leaders out of the unions on charges that they were soft on Communism or working for the Russians or one thing or another. Again, that\u2019s pretty specific to the United States. You can see that strikingly today where there is huge debate about Sanders being a socialist. \u201cHow can we have a socialist president?\u201d In fact, Sanders is what would be called a moderate social democrat in most other societies. In other societies, the word \u201csocialist\u201d is not a curse word \u2014 people call themselves socialists and even communists. In the United States, there\u2019s a stigma attached to it by massive propaganda going way back to 1917. Such huge propaganda efforts to demonize the concepts of socialism and communism (saying it means the \u201cgulag\u201d or whatever) is again pretty much unique to the United States. It\u2019s a barrier to introducing even mild New Deal\u2013style social-democratic reforms. These are all specific problems. They\u2019re not completely unique to the United States, of course, but they happen to be exaggerated here because of the nature of the society \u2014 that it is business-run to an unusual extent, and this business community is militant and organized. The Chamber of Commerce and other business organizations are fighting a bitter class war. The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), for example, is an important business-based institution which draws support from pretty much the entire spectrum of business. They\u2019re fighting a serious class war now to try to make it impossible to pass any reform legislation. The way they\u2019re doing it is by operating at the state level. They write legislation for states \u2014 business-based corporate propaganda \u2014 and try to get state legislators to pass it. It\u2019s not very difficult to bribe a US Senator, but it takes some work. However, to pressure the state legislature is much easier; they don\u2019t have any resources and they\u2019re unable to stand up again massive corporate lobbying and pressure. So, the state legislatures tend to pass this legislation. lot of it is remarkably regressive. They\u2019re very clearly trying to destroy the public education system and any labor reforms. In fact, they go so far that they\u2019re succeeding in blocking efforts to stop the theft of wages being criminalized. Theft of wages is ahuge businessin the United States. Workers are having their wages stolen at the level of billions of dollars per year, with employers simply refusing to pay. Wage theft is a huge business. ALEC is trying to prevent it from even being investigated, let alone prosecuted, and they\u2019re succeeding. This is an illustration of the savagery of the highly class-conscious business classes. One of the most insidious of their proposals, which is proceeding more or less secretly, is an effort to get states to demand an amendment to the Constitution which will require a balanced budget. If you get enough states to ratify that, there\u2019s an amendment. Of course, a balanced budget for the federal government means that we pour money into the military and cut back on social benefits. They\u2019re coming pretty close to achieving that. It\u2019s almost never reported in the media but they\u2019re pretty much succeeding. This is a class war that goes on constantly in the United States to a level far beyond other comparable societies. You can see this in many ways. If you take a look at CEO salaries relative to workers\u2019 pay the gap, especially since the 1980s, is far higher in the United States than it is in European societies. These are all crucial issues in the United States which require a very intensive effort. The reason why Sanders is vilified in the media pretty much across the spectrum is not so much because of his policies. It\u2019s because he has inspired a mass popular movement which doesn\u2019t just show up every four years to push a button but is acting constantly \u2014 pressuring \u2014 to achieve changes and having some success. That\u2019s frightening for the business class. The role of the public is to be passive spectators and not to interfere."

You have referred to what you described in the past as \u201cOrwell\u2019s problem\u201d \u2014 a population which despite so much access to information is misled and propagandized by a powerful media system. Do you think that\u2019s still the case? And how can the general public transcend that system of control?",
    "output": "The fact that some people, in fact quite a lot of people, break out of it is not terribly surprising. I mean, even in totalitarian states you have dissidents despite severe punishment and the total control of the media. People are not just robots \u2014 plenty of people can see what\u2019s in front of their eyes. On the other hand, when you talk about access to information, you have to be pretty careful. For example, one of the major popular research institutions that studies popular attitudes in the United States, the Pew Research Center, just came out with a pretty remarkable study. They took about thirty news sources \u2014 television, print, radio, and blogs \u2014 and they asked people which ones they know and trust, and they divided it between Democrats and Republicans. Among Democrats, pretty much no one trusts the major media outlets. Among Republicans the only ones that received even a slight majority wereFox News, Rush Limbaugh, andBreitbart, which is an ultraright website. Even theWall Street Journalis considered too far left for most Republicans. You just listen to Rush Limbaugh someday. You\u2019ll see what kind of information people are getting. For Rush Limbaugh, science, government, and the media are pillars of deceit \u2014 and you just have to listen to the ultraright instead. That\u2019s what Republicans, almost half the population, are getting as information. Not that the rest is so open and free, far from it. What do you do about this? You do what you\u2019ve always done. You have to work hard on education and organization. The labor movement used to be a major base for it \u2014 that can be revived. And there are other bases that can be developed and are being developed. On many issues popular activism is breaking through. One good example is the environmental movement. Despite overwhelming corporate opposition, Congress is now pressured by popular activism to address its highly regressive policies on this issue. That could make a difference, and there\u2019s a lot more like that."

    "output": "If anything like that happens, the calamity will be on a scale that is almost imponderable, most severe as you say for the poorest and most vulnerable, but awful enough for the rest of society as well. And it is not the most threatening current projection. We are approaching ominously close to the level of global warming 125,000 years ago when sea levels were 6\u20139 meters higher than today, and the rapid melting of Antarctic sea ice threatens to narrow the gap, possibly by nonlinear acceleration, some recent studies suggest. Is there a chance to avoid such catastrophes? No doubt. There are well-worked out and sound proposals; economistRobert Pollin\u2019s work on a Green New Dealis the best I know. But the task ahead is enormous, and there is not much time. The challenge would be great even if states were committed to overcoming it. Some are. But it is impossible to overlook the fact that the most powerful state in human history is under the leadership of what can only be accurately described as a gang of arch-criminals who are dedicated to racing to the cliff with abandon. It is hard even to find words to capture the scale of the crimes they are contemplating. A small but telling example is a 500-page environmental assessment produced by Trump\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration calling for cancelling new automotive emissions standards. They have a sound argument. The study projects that by the end of the century temperatures will have risen 4 degrees Centigrade. Auto emissions don\u2019t add that much, and since the game is pretty much over, why not have fun while we can \u2014 fiddling while the planet burns. It\u2019s hard to find the words to comment \u2014 and in fact it passed with little notice. The attitudes of the leadership influence opinion in the Republican Party, whose members typically do not see global warming as a particularly serious problem. In fact it isranked very lowamong crucial issues by the population in general (and the growing threat of nuclear war, the second existential issue, is not even listed in attitude surveys)."

According to astudy by economists Mark Weisbrot and Jeffrey Sachs, economic sanctions implemented by the Trump administration against Venezuela since August 2017 have caused tens of thousands of deaths and are rapidly worsening the humanitarian crisis in the country. To be sure, Venezuela has many problems of its own making, but Western powers \u2014 in particular the United States \u2014 have played a significant role in undermining its democracy since the early days of Chavez, including a failed military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in 2002. Now, the policy of \u201cregime change\u201d has taken a more overt and dangerous direction under Trump. How should this situation be resolved, and why does Venezuela receive such slanted coverage in most media outlets?",
    "output": "The United States at first tolerated Hugo Chavez as a bad boy who could be tamed, but that changed when he persuaded OPEC to reduce production to sustain prices for the benefit of oil producers. Shortly after, a military coup took place deposing Chavez and disbanding the government, openly welcomed by Washington and lauded by the liberal media. It was, however, quickly overturned and the United States had to resort to sabotage and subversion, with the cooperation of the bitterly anti-Chavez economic elites. This is not the place to review those years, but there were several policy failures that have a role in the present crisis: failure to diversify the oil-based economy that had developed since the United States took over a century ago after the discovery of oil, and to put aside reserves during the years of high oil prices. After Chavez\u2019s death, oil prices declined, and the Maduro government had to turn to hostile international credit markets. His government also made atrocious economic decisions and turned to harsh repression as the opposition mounted intense and often militant protest. The Trump sanctions have turned asevere crisis into a catastrophe, as recognized by the opposition\u2019s leading economist, the well-informed Francisco Rodriguez \u2014 the usual impact of sanctions on civilian societies. Rodriguez, who puts the primary blame on Maduro\u2019s policies, reports that US financial sanctions are associated with a huge drop in oil production, worth about $16.9 billion a year, warning of disastrous consequences in a country which grows barely a third of the food it needs. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a famine in Venezuela,\u201d Mr Rodriguez said. \u201cTotal imports in April were only $303 million and around half of those were oil-related. That is just 8 percent of the 2012 figure ... even if all the imports were of food, it would still be far off the amount needed to feed the country.\u201d It is easy to shout and scream, but the only hope for resolution that I have seen proposed is negotiations between the opposing parties leading to some sort of transitional government. The media usually troop along politely behind state policy, but the hostility to Chavez from the first days and since has been unusually vitriolic, sometimes in quite remarkable ways. HS: In Britain, efforts to keep Labour leaderJeremy Corbynout of power overaccusations of antisemitismhave had the alarming effect of conflating criticism of Israel or anti-Zionism with hatred of Jewish people.You have described these tactics as a disgrace, and said theyinsult the memory of Holocaust victims. I\u2019d like you to comment on how erroneous charges of antisemitism ultimately hurt Jews, and why expanded definitions of the term (which, for example, consider certain advocacy for Palestinian rights as anti-Jewish bigotry) can be problematic. The classic statement of this position is by the distinguished Israeli statesman Abba Eban, highly regarded particularly in England as a British gentleman (Cambridge graduate, cultivated accent, etc.). In 1973, when he was Israeli foreign minister, Eban wrote an interesting article in a leading liberal Jewish journal [Congress Bi-Weekly] in which he explained that \u201cOne of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the Gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not a distinction at all. Anti-Zionism is merely the new anti-Semitism.\u201d That defines the task very explicitly. Here \u201canti-Zionism\u201d means criticism of policies of the State of Israel. He made that quite clear by adding: \u201cLet there be no mistake: the new left is the author and the progenitor of the new anti-Semitism.\u201d The New Left in fact was overwhelmingly Zionist, but beginning to be mildly critical of some of the policies of the occupation and illegal settlement over which Eban was presiding. Eban also identified two arch-criminals: I.F. Stone and me, \u201cwhose basic complex is one of guilt about Jewish survival\u201d and therefore are beyond the range of rational discussion. Hiswild accusationsabout the \u201cNew Left,\u201d worth reading, are equally ludicrous \u2014 as he certainly knew, being literate. The message from on high was clear, and has been followed dutifully since, sometimes in ways reminiscent of Marx\u2019s comment about tragedy repeated as farce. One example is a major publication on the \u201creal Anti-Semitism\u201d by the Anti-Defamation League \u2014 which changed after the 1967 conquests from an authentic civil rights organization to a parody of Stalinism. The real antisemitism turns out not to be that boring old stuff about \u201ckill the Jews\u201d and denying the Holocaust but rather giving \u201cwar a bad name and peace too favorable a press,\u201d protesting against the Vietnam War and US crimes in Central America, \u201csniping\u201d at the defense budget, and in general interfering with US power \u2014 Israel\u2019s defender. The attacks on Corbyn and his reinvigorated Labour Party draw from the same sources. Thus, longtime Labour activist Chris Williamson is accused of antisemitism, with demands that he be expelled from the party, with the primary charge offered being that he said Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d in defending its strong record of struggle against \u201cthe scourge of antisemitism.\u201d More of the \u201creal antisemitism.\u201d The efforts, on both sides of the Atlantic, are becoming more passionate, in interesting ways, as it is becoming more and more clear that Israel is losing control over liberal public opinion and is compelled to rely for support on the most reactionary elements and the fundamentalist Evangelical movement, which combines fervent support for the most extreme Israeli actions with unparalleled antisemitism (consider the fate of those Jews who have not \u201cfound Christ\u201d by the end of times and the return of Christ). Authentic antisemites, I presume, are delighted to see Jews self-ridiculed in this fashion, while others should be shuddering at the spectacle. That\u2019s not of course to deny that one can ferret out strains of antisemitism in the Labour Party \u2014 at about the level of England, so general studies haveindicated, quite low by historical standards and vastly below hatred of Muslims and other prevalent forms of racism."

    "input": "HS: I was reminded ofManufacturing Consentrecently, while reading headlines about growing tensions between Iran and the United States. Thisarticlein theWashington Postis, I think, emblematic of efforts by certain media outlets to misrepresent the conflict by minimizing Trump\u2019s abandonment of the nuclear deal and framing Iran\u2019s renewed enrichment of uranium as the catalyst forheightened hostilities. Can you explain why this sort of reporting is dangerous, and how critical readers should effectively appraise coverage of international relations in the news media?",
    "output": "The media almost reflexively adopt the basic framework of state doctrine. At the liberal end of the spectrum (theNew York Times,Washington Post) they typically soften the edges slightly, yielding the impression of independence. Reporting of the Iran-US tensions is typical of the long-standing pattern, documented to the sky. According to state propaganda, Iran is the guilty party. The United States has to decide whether and how to respond to Iran\u2019s provocations and general malice. The liberal media, in their most critical stance, frame it differently \u2014 both sides are increasing tensions. Reality is dramatically different, and hardly in question. Iran has lived up completely to the stringent terms of the JCPOA (uniquely harsh for a signer of the Non-Proliferation Treaty). US intelligence and all other credible sources agree. The Trump administration withdrew from the treaty, effectively destroying it, and imposedsavage sanctionsdesigned to destroy the economy and punish the population. Iran refrained from any reaction, hoping that the European Union might have the courage to depart from the master\u2019s orders, but when it failed to do so, Iran began to take some steps to restore its nuclear programs \u2014 as indeed it is entitled to do under the NPT and once the JCPOA is abrogated. It may or may not have carried out some provocative actions in the Gulf as charged by the Trump-Bolton-Pompeo axis, not famous for their credibility. All of this is dismissed to the margins. Unmentionable in the free press is the internationalGallup pollthat asked which country is the greatest threat to world peace: the United States, no one else even close. Iran barely mentioned \u2014 in contradiction to the US mantra, constantly intoned, that Iran is the greatest threat to peace and the United States is of course the world\u2019s leading advocate of peace and democracy. There is a straightforward way to mitigate or end any imagined Iranian nuclear threat: establish a nuclear weapons-free zone (NWFZ) in the Middle East, with adequate inspections, such as those that have been carried out in Iran under the JCPOA without interference, as acknowledged. The idea was proposed decades ago by the Arab states. It is strongly supported by Iran,G-77, and virtually every other country, but is regularly vetoed by the United States at the NPT review conferences, most recently by Obama. The reason is scarcely concealed. It would mean acknowledging the existence of Israel\u2019s huge nuclear weapons arsenal \u2014 which would render military aid to Israel illegal under US law \u2014 and permitting it to be inspected, evidently intolerable. Advocacy of such a policy must therefore be another form of \u201cthe real antisemitism.\u201d An interesting footnote, also under a ban, is that the United States and Britain have a unique obligation to pursue a NWFZ in the Middle East. In seeking to concoct a pretext for invading Iraq they appealed to UN Security Council Resolution 687; they falsely claimed that Iraq had violated by developing nuclear weapons. The only violators of the treaty are the United States and United Kingdom, undermining its call for establishing a NWFZ in the Middle East. It is becoming somewhat boring to reiterate all of this endlessly to ears that are closed by fanatic loyalty to doctrinal verities. Something Orwell anticipated when he discussed how in free England, \u201cunpopular ideas can be suppressed without the use of force.\u201d"

On the other hand, this developing relationship may be used by Trump and his administration as leverage to further US geopolitical objectives in Asia. What is your reading of the situation?",
    "output": "It is an error, in my opinion, to seek some geopolitical strategy behind Trump\u2019s various antics. He regularly makes his guiding principle quite clear, for example, in announcing his plans for the July 4 extravaganza \u2014 \u201cRed Square on the Potomac\u201d as theFinancial Timesdescribed it acidly. Trump tweeted that the master of ceremonies would be \u201cYour favorite president: Me.\u201d That is indeed the guiding principle of the infantile megalomaniac who holds the future of the world in his grip \u2014 quite an amazing commentary on the human species. The principle has consequences. One is that everything done in the past (particularly by the hated Obama) was a total disaster, harming America, but now the Greatest Deal Maker in Human History will set it straight. In most cases the consequences are disastrous, but sometimes his actions are more or less reasonable \u2014 and subjected to bitter denunciation across the spectrum. His dealings with Kim Jong-un, whatever his motives, are a case in point. In April 2018, the two Koreas issued a historic declaration outlining steps towards accommodation and eventual denuclearization, to be carried out \u201con their own accord,\u201d without foreign interference that it in the past has been deeply harmful. By whom, it is not hard to show from the actual historical record, usually misrepresented in reporting and commentary, though well-known to scholarship. Trump has pretty much lived up to that. His meeting with Kim Jong-un at the demilitarized zone and symbolic step across the border might, with good will, be a step towards resolving this terrible and ominous conflict. Whatever the outcome, the major outside powers, not least the United States, will maneuver to adapt it to their goals. That\u2019s the way the world works \u2014 as long as populations allow it to happen."

Do we now live in a mutlipolar world? Is Trump the last gasp of American empire, or far from it?",
    "output": "We have lived in a multipolar world for half a century. The Russian empire aside, the world has had one overwhelming military power, but by 1970, three major centers of social and economic power: German-based Europe, US-based North America, and the dynamic Northeast Asian region, then Japan-based. Already by then the US capacity to \u201csuppress independent development\u201d had somewhat declined. Reagan\u2019s criminal atrocities in Central America were a human and social catastrophe, but the United States was no longer able simply to carry out military coups and impose the terror regime of its choice, as in the past. And the capacity has declined further since, though it is still alive and well. As is the American empire, though in changing forms. Militarily, of course, the United States stands entirely alone in the world. In economic terms, US GDP has declined as a share of the world economy since its peak at the end of World War II. But as discussed by political economistSean Starrs\u2014 national accounts no longer have quite their former significance in the era of neoliberal globalization. A crucial measure of national economic power is the share of world wealth held by domestically based multinationals. By this measure, as he shows, US economic power is spectacular. US-based multinational corporations hold about half of world wealth, and are first in virtually every category. In addition, the United States has effective control of the world\u2019s financial system, which enables it to impose crushing and murderous sanctions designed to punish the populations of states that are guilty of \u201csuccessful defiance\u201d \u2014 the fundamental crime of Cuba, as the State Department explained in internal documents in the early sixties, and today the crime of Iran as well. Empire is not a well-defined concept, but in terms of power to control and coerce, the United States ranks supreme in the global system. The US system of global dominance is likely to survive even Trump\u2019s erratically swinging wrecking ball, perhaps in modified form, with greater prominence for the alliance of reactionary states and \u201cilliberal democracies\u201d taking shape under his aegis. Whether the environment that sustains organized human society will survive Trump and his Republican Party is a different question."

Leaving aside for the moment the surrealist nature of contemporary US political life, do you detect some hidden political strategy behind Trump\u2019s funding conflict over the border wall with the Democrats?",
    "output": "There\u2019s a political strategy, but I\u2019m not convinced that it\u2019s hidden. With Trump, everything is pretty much on the surface. There have been constant efforts by political analysts to discern some deep geostrategic or sociopolitical thinking behind his performances, but they seem to me unconvincing. What he does seems readily explained simply on the well-grounded assumption that his doctrine is simple: ME! Trump understands that he has a primary constituency \u2014 extreme wealth and corporate power \u2014 and that he has to serve its interests or he\u2019s finished. That task has largely been assigned to the Ryans and McConnells, who have performed it admirably. Profits are skyrocketing, real wages are barely increasing despite low unemployment, regulations that might limit greed (and help mere people) are being dismantled, and the one legislative achievement \u2014 the tax scam \u2014 put lots of dollars in the right pockets and created a deficit that can be used as a pretext to undermine benefits. All is working smoothly \u2014 with analogues worldwide. But Trump must maintain enough of a voting base to stay in power. That requires posturing as the defender of the ordinary guy against hated \u201celites\u201d (always suppressing the true \u201cmasters of mankind,\u201d to borrow Adam Smith\u2019s phrase for the merchants and manufacturers who were \u201cthe principal architects\u201d of policy). This act is helped along by such figures as Rush Limbaugh, who instructs his tens of millions of followers that they should beware of \u201cthe four corners of deceit: government, academia, science and media,\u201d institutions that \u201care now corrupt and exist by virtue of deceit.\u201d So, he argues, just listen to ME. Meanwhile Trump must rise to the defense of the masses from awesome threats, chief among them now the hordes of \u201crapists,\u201d \u201cmurderers\u201d and \u201cIslamic terrorists\u201d he says are being mobilized down south to storm across the border and slaughter decent law-abiding white Christian Americans. We must therefore have a \u201cbeautiful wall\u201d \u2014 whichtheywill pay for. Trump promised that, and to back down would not only betray the trembling masses but also be a defeat, which his ego cannot tolerate. The game is not really new. After all, the revered Ronald Reagan bravely donned his cowboy uniform and declared a National Emergency to protect the country from the Nicaraguan army, supposedly poised to destroy us all only two days\u2019 drive from Harlingen, Texas. Trump is only carrying it further, helped by the fading of such infantile notions as \u201ctruth\u201d \u2014 or \u201cfalse realities,\u201d to borrow Jared Kushner\u2019s innovation. Former Secretary of State Dean Acheson\u2019s admonition that policymakers must be \u201cclearer than truth\u201d has long passed into obsolescence. They can do far better in the atmosphere of \u201calternative facts\u201d for those liberated from the four pillars of deceit. I doubt that there is any deeper political strategy. Furthermore, such performances are rather natural, perhaps even necessary. As both parties have drifted to the right during the neoliberal assault on the population, the Democrats abandoned the working class and became pretty much what used to be called \u201cmoderate Republicans\u201d (something that is beginning to change now in promising ways) while Republicans climbed so deeply into the pockets of the super-rich and corporate power that it became impossible for them to gain anywhere near enough votes on their actual policies. Antics of the Trump style fit the requirements, along with a variety of measures to suppress voting and increased reliance on the many regressive aspects of the constitutional system, which by now make it possible for a small minority of white Christian traditional rural older citizens to have effective control of the government. The tendency is increasing and may soon lead to a major political crisis since it is virtually ineradicable given the structure of the Senate, designed by the Framers so that the small states would ratify the mostly unpopular Federal Constitution. A topic for another day."

After all, the former chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, James Inhofe, condemned efforts to address global warming as sacrilege: \u201cGod\u2019s still up there,\u201d he proclaimed, and \u201cthe arrogance of people to think that we, human beings, would be able to change what He is doing in the climate is to me outrageous.\u201d It seems to work, at least in Oklahoma, where the senior senator has been in office since 1994. Doubtless well beyond Oklahoma, in a society with fundamentalist religious commitments that are far beyond the norm. Yes, mysterious and dangerous \u2014 as is the fact that half of Republicans deny that global warming is even taking place, and of the rest, barely more than half think that humans have some responsibility for it. But there\u2019s good news too. Trump\u2019s new acting administrator of the EPA, former coal industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler, agrees that global warming is probably happening \u2014 a problem he considers to be an \u201ceight or nine\u201d on a one-to-10 scale of concern, he informed Congress at his confirmation hearings."

First, what\u2019s your assessment of what\u2019s happening in Venezuela, and, second, why is it that much of the left worldwide continues to support Maduro when it is obvious that he has been a complete disaster?",
    "output": "Maduro has been a disaster, and the best the opposition has to offer is the self-declared President Juan Guaid\u00f3. About him little is known, apart from his great admiration for the neo-fascist Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, whom Guaid\u00f3 praised for his commitment to \u201cdemocracy [and] human rights,\u201d as illustrated, for example, by his criticism of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship \u2014 because it ... didn\u2019t murder 30,000 people as in neighboring Argentina, the worst of the vicious military dictatorships that swept across South America from the \u201860s. The roots of the Venezuelan disaster go back to failures of the Chavez administration, including its failure to diversify the economy, which is still almost entirely reliant on oil export. Venezuelan opposition economist Francisco Rodr\u00edguez, former chief Andean economist for the Bank of America, notes the failure of the government to set aside reserves during the period of high oil prices so it was at the mercy of international financial markets when prices dropped sharply in 2014 \u2014 and has been blocked from access to credit by harsh US sanctions, which have exacerbated the effects of what Rodr\u00edguez describes as the \u201catrocious\u201d mismanagement of the economy under Maduro. Writing in Foreign Policy, Rodr\u00edguez observes that the policy of \u201cStarving the Venezuelan economy of its foreign currency earnings risks turning the country\u2019s current humanitarian crisis into a full-blown humanitarian catastrophe.\u201d Arguably that is the purpose, following the Nixon-Kissinger script of \u201cmaking the economy scream\u201d to undermine the Allende regime. (That was the soft track; the hard track, soon implemented, was brutal military dictatorship.) The drift toward civil war, with outside interference, is all too apparent. There is still room for negotiations among the contending parties, but it diminishes daily as the crisis deepens. Maduro is digging and Washington is intensifying its intervention, imposing new sanctions and selecting the egregious Elliott Abrams to join Bolton and Pompeo in what has been called \u201cTrump\u2019s axis of evil.\u201d If skeletons can shudder, many must be doing so in the Central American countries that Abrams helped to ravage during Reagan\u2019s terrorist wars."

    "output": "Iran joined Russia in ensuring Assad\u2019s victory in Syria, along with Iran\u2019s Lebanese ally Hezbollah. Israel has been bombing Syria regularly. Four months ago the IDF reported over 200 strikes against Iranian targets since 2017, and they have been increasing since. Israel, of course, has overwhelming military dominance in the Middle East, even apart from its close alliance with the US, which lavishly funds its military with the most advanced weapons in the US arsenal and even uses Israel to pre-position US weapons. And, of course, Israel is the region\u2019s sole nuclear power, the reason why Washington has regularly blocked international efforts, led by the Arab states and Iran, to establish a nuclear weapons-free zone (furthermore, WMD-free) in the Middle East. That would end any imagined Iran nuclear threat, but it is unacceptable because the primary US client state in the region would have to open its nuclear arsenal to inspection, and those who regard US law as having some force would have to stanch the flood of military support for Israel. Iran is not under US control and is therefore an enemy. Furthermore, the US and Israel recognize that Iran is a deterrent to their free resort to force in the region. The same is true of Hezbollah, whose Iranian-supplied missiles target large parts of Israel. The US and Israel have been threatening to attack Iran for years (\u201call options are open\u201d) in radical violation of the UN Charter (hence the US Constitution), but that is a matter of no concern for lawless states with overwhelming power. And Trump has, of course, escalated the confrontation by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear agreement. An actual invasion of Iran would be too costly and dangerous, but the US-Israel might consider attacking from a distance after somehow neutralizing Hezbollah (which would mean destroying much of Lebanon). The consequences could be devastating."

    "output": "It\u2019s impossible to replace something that has never really existed, but it\u2019s true that the partial democracies of the West have been undermined further by the financialization of the international economy during the neoliberal years. That\u2019s a large part of the reason for the bitterness, anger and resentment, mislabeled \u201cpopulism,\u201d that is shaking the foundations of the western democracies, where the centrist political parties that have run the political system are crumbling in election after election. Many analysts have to account for the rise of such \u201cpopulism\u201d throughout the neoliberal capitalist world on the basis of psychic disorders \u2014 in one respected version, impulses \u201cdeep in our psyches and bodies beyond matters of fact: physical pain, fear of the future, a sense of our own mortality.\u201d It is, however, not really necessary to appeal to an epidemic of irrationality and \u201cemotional appeals\u201d somehow spreading over the domains subjected to the neoliberal assault of the past generation, including the enormous growth of largely predatory financial institutions with its deleterious impact on democratic systems of governance. Fear that the \u201crascal multitude\u201d will threaten the property of the self-designated \u201cmen of best quality\u201d traces back to the first modern democratic revolution in 17th century England, and was a major concern of the framers of the US Constitution in its successor a century later. It reappears constantly when there is even a minor threat to overwhelming power, as in the famous Powell memorandum of 1971, which warned that the world is practically coming to an end because of the slight infringement on overwhelming business domination of the society. The influential manifesto, sent to the US Chamber of Commerce, helped set off the harsh counterattack in the years since. It\u2019s not surprising that these fears are surfacing in Davos as a few young Democratic representatives are arousing the rascal multitude again. For many years, a considerable majority of the US population has favored higher taxes on the rich, while they regularly decline. And now, a few recently elected members of Congress are advocating what the public wants, most vocally Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who even went so far as to suggest tax rates at a level regarded as optimal for the economy by the most prominent specialists (Nobel laureate Peter Diamond, Emmanuel Saez, among others).

This is much deeper than Trump. And we have to face those facts. Some do.

All through Trump\u2019s term, the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock, the best general assessment we have of the state of the world, moved closer to midnight \u2014 termination \u2014 reached the highest point ever. This January, it exceeded it. The analysts gave up minutes, moved to seconds: a hundred seconds to midnight, thanks to Donald Trump. And the Republican Party, which is just monstrous, no longer qualifies as a political party. It simply sheepishly echoes everything the master says. Zero integrity. It\u2019s just amazing to watch. He\u2019s surrounded himself by a collection of sycophants who just repeat worshipfully everything he says. Real major attack on democracy, alongside the attack on \u201cthe survival of humanity,\u201d to quote JPMorgan Chase again \u2014 the nuclear war, raising the threat of nuclear war, dismantling the arms control system, which has, to some extent, protected us from total disaster. It\u2019s astonishing to watch. The same memo that I quoted about how the policies we\u2019re following are risking the survival of humanity ended by arguing that the banks should cut back its fossil fuel support, in part because of the reputational consequences. Their reputation is being harmed. What does that mean? That means that activists are putting pressure on them, and they have to maintain some kind of reputation. Now, that\u2019s a good lesson. And it works. We\u2019ve seen some very striking examples. Take, say, the Green New Deal. A couple of years ago, that was an object of ridicule, if it was mentioned at all. Some form of Green New Deal is essential for the survival of humanity. Now it\u2019s part of the general agenda. Why? Activist engagement. Especially Sunrise Movement, a group of young people, acted significantly, up to the point of sitting in in congressional offices. They received support from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other young legislators who came into office as part of the Sanders-inspired popular wave \u2014 another great success. Ed Markey, senator from Massachusetts joined in. Now it\u2019s a part of the legislative agenda. The next step is to force it through in some viable form. And there are very good ideas as to how to do that. Well, that\u2019s the way things can change. With a Biden presidency, there would be, if not a strongly sympathetic administration, at least one that can be reached, can be pressured. And that\u2019s very important. If you look over the very good labor historian \u2014 I\u2019m sure you know Erik Loomis, who has studied the efforts by working people to institute changes in the society, sometimes for themselves, sometimes for the society generally. And he\u2019s pointed out \u2014 made an interesting point. These efforts succeeded when there was a tolerant or sympathetic administration, not when there wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s a big \u2014 one of many enormous differences between Trump, the sociopath, and Biden, who\u2019s kind of a pretty empty \u2014 you can push him one way or another. This is the most crucial election in human history, literally. Another four years of Trump, and we\u2019re in deep trouble. AMYGOODMAN:Back with professor Noam Chomsky in 30 seconds. [break] AMYGOODMAN:\u201cAve Maria,\u201d performed today, Good Friday, inside the burned-out shell of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. It was live-streamed. This isDemocracy Now!, democracynow.org,The Quarantine Report. I\u2019m Amy Goodman, as we continue my interview with Noam Chomsky. I asked him how the United States, the wealthiest country in the world, has become the epicenter of the pandemic. NOAMCHOMSKY:Well, the United States is \u2014 I mean, countries have reacted to this in many ways, some very successfully, some more or less successfully. One is at the bottom of the barrel. That\u2019s us. The United States is the only major country that cannot even provide data to the World Health Organization, because it\u2019s so dysfunctional. There\u2019s a background. Part of the background is the scandalous healthcare system, which simply is not ready for anything that\u2019s out of the normal. It simply doesn\u2019t work. This is exacerbated by the strange collection of gangsters in Washington, who have \u2014 it\u2019s almost as if they systematically took every possible step to make it as bad as possible. Through Trump\u2019s term, the last four years, he has been systematically cutting back on all of the health-related aspects of the government. Pentagon goes up. Building his wall goes up. But anything \u2014 actually, anything that might benefit the general population goes down, particularly health. Some of it is almost surreal. So, in October, for example, just very exquisite timing, he canceled completely aUSAIDproject \u2014 Predict, it was called \u2014 that was working in Third World countries, also in China, to try to detect new viruses that might turn into the anticipated pandemic. And in fact it was anticipated since \u2014 at least since theSARSepidemic in 2003. So we have a kind of combination of factors, some of them specific to the United States. If we want to ensure or at least hope to avoid new pandemics, which are very likely to come, more serious than this one, in part because of the enormous rising threat of global warming, we have to look at the sources of this one. And it\u2019s very important to think them through. So, just roughly to go back, pandemics have been predicted by scientists for years. TheSARSepidemic was quite serious. It was contained, but vaccines were \u2014 there was the beginning of development of vaccines. They never proceeded to the testing phase. It was clear at that time that something more was going to happen, and several epidemics did. But it\u2019s not enough to know that. Somebody has to pick up the ball and run with it. Who can do it? Well, the drug companies are the obvious place, but they have no interest in it. They follow good capitalist logic: You look at market signals, and there\u2019s no profit to be made in preparing for a predicted and anticipated catastrophe. So they weren\u2019t interested. At that point, another possibility is the government could step in. I\u2019m old enough to remember the terror of polio was ended by a government-initiated and -funded project that finally led to the Salk vaccine, which was free, no intellectual property rights. Jonas Salk said it should be as free as the sun. OK, that ended the polio terror, measles terror, others. But the government couldn\u2019t step in, because there\u2019s another particular aspect of the modern era: the neoliberal plague. Now, you remember Ronald Reagan\u2019s sunny smile and his little maxim about how government is the problem, not the solution. So the government can\u2019t enter. There were some efforts, nevertheless, to try to prepare for this. Right now in New York and other places, doctors and nurses are forced to make agonizing decisions about who to kill \u2014 not a nice decision to make \u2014 because they simply don\u2019t have equipment. And the main lack is ventilators, huge shortage of ventilators. Well, the Obama administration did make an effort to try to prepare for this. And this kind of dramatically reveals the kind of factors that are leading to catastrophe. They contracted with a small company that was producing high-quality, low-cost ventilators. The company was bought up by a larger one, Covidien, which makes fancy, expensive ventilators. And they shelved the project. Presumably, they didn\u2019t want competition with their own costly ones. Shortly after that, they turned to the government and said they wanted the contract ended. The reason was it was not profitable enough, so therefore no ventilators. We have the same thing in hospitals. Hospitals, under the neoliberal programs, are supposed to be efficient, meaning no spare capacity, just enough beds to get by. And in fact, plenty of people, me included, can testify that even the best hospitals caused great pain and suffering to patients even before this broke out, because of this just-on-time efficiency concept that was guiding our privatized, for-profit healthcare system. When anything hits out of the normal, it\u2019s just tough luck. And this runs across the system. So we have a combination of capitalist logic, which is lethal but could be controlled, but it can\u2019t be controlled under the neoliberal programs, which also say the government can\u2019t step in to pick up the ball when the private sector doesn\u2019t. On top of that \u2014 now, this becomes specific to the United States \u2014 we have a freak show in Washington, a totally dysfunctional government, which is causing enormous problems. And it\u2019s not that nothing was known. A pandemic was anticipated all through Trump\u2019s term, even before. His reaction was to cut back preparation for it. Astonishingly, this continued even after the pandemic hit. So, on February 10th, when it was already serious, Trump released his budget for the coming year. Take a look at it. The budget continues the defunding of the Center for Disease Control and other government institutions responsible for health, continues to defund them. It increases funding for some things, like fossil fuel production, gives new subsidies to the fossil fuel industries. I mean, it\u2019s as if the country is simply \u2014 maybe not \u201cas if\u201d \u2014 the country is simply run by sociopaths. And the result, so, we cut back on the efforts to deal with the pandemic that\u2019s taking shape, and we increase the efforts to destroy the environment, in which \u2014 the efforts in which the United States, under Trump, is in the lead in racing to the abyss. Now, bear in mind that that\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t have to tell you \u2014 is a far more serious threat than the coronavirus. Now, this is bad and serious, particularly in the United States, but we\u2019ll recover somehow, at severe cost. We\u2019re not going to recover from the melting of the polar ice sheets, which is leading to a feedback effect, well known, that increases \u2014 as they melt, there\u2019s less reflective surface, more absorption in the dark seas. The warming that\u2019s melting increases. That\u2019s just one of the factors that\u2019s leading to destruction, unless we do something about it. And it\u2019s not a secret. Just recently, for example, couple of weeks ago, there was a very interesting leak, a memo from JPMorgan Chase, America\u2019s biggest bank, which warned that, in their words, \u201cthe survival of humanity\u201d is at risk if we continue on our present course, which included the funding of fossil fuel industries by the bank itself, said we\u2019re endangering the survival of humanity. Everyone who\u2019s got eyes open in the Trump administration is very well aware of this. It\u2019s difficult to find words for this. I should say, other countries have \u2014 first of all, it was not a secret. I mean, it\u2019s become convenient now. Trump is desperately seeking some scapegoat that he can blame for his astonishing failures and incompetence. The most recent one is the World Health Organization, the China bashing. Somebody else is responsible. But it\u2019s simply \u2014 the facts are very clear. China very quickly informed the World Health Organization last December that they were finding patients with pneumonia-like symptoms with unknown etiology. Didn\u2019t know what it was. About a week later, January 7th, they made public the fact to the World Health Organization, the general scientific community in the world, that Chinese scientists had found out what the source was: a coronavirus resembling theSARSvirus. They had identified the sequence, the genome. They were providing the information to the world. U.S. intelligence was well aware of it. They spent January and February trying to get somebody in the White House to pay attention to the fact that there\u2019s a major pandemic. Just nobody could listen. Trump was off playing golf or maybe listening \u2014 checking his TV ratings. Yesterday, we learned that one very high-level official, very close to the administration, Peter Navarro, in late January had sent a very strong message to the White House saying this is a real danger. But even he couldn\u2019t break through."

And Trump took from that setting a travel ban on China, but not doing a corollary, which was ensuring that the United States had the proper tests and also had thePPE, the protective personal equipment, that doctors, that nurses, that the custodial staff in hospitals needed to stay alive, to treat patients, to help them stay alive. And the intelligence agencies, it came out, at this time, even before Navarro, they were all warning Trump. If you could go back to even two years ago, when he disbanded his pandemic unit within the National Security Council, said that when he\u2019s at the table in China talking about spending money on bombs or a wall, they\u2019re not saying, \u201cSir, you also have to look at what\u2019s happening here\u201d? And that unit, pandemic unit, not only is about how we deal in the United States, but also ensuring, as theCDCdoes and other agencies of the U.S. government, that scientists are sent out to other countries, like China, to investigate and to help other countries, because when it comes to a pandemic, we\u2019re all in this together. So, if you could talk about these early warnings and why testing and this personal \u2014 protective personal equipment is so important?",

Trump cuts further the health-related components of the government, continuing the hit. They were under the ax, just as they were throughout his term. Actually, the clips that you played before are part of a very clever strategy. Whether this is consciously planned or just intuitive, I don\u2019t know. But the pattern of simply making one statement today, contradicting it tomorrow, coming out with something else the next day is really brilliant. It means he\u2019s going to be vindicated. Whatever happens, he\u2019ll have said it. You shoot arrows at random, some of them are going to hit the target. And his technique with the Fox echo chamber and the worshipful base simply tuned to Fox, Limbaugh, etc., they\u2019re just going to pick whatever happened to be right, and say, \u201cLook, our wonderful president, the greatest president we\u2019ve ever had, our savior, knew it all along, and here was his statement.\u201d Can\u2019t miss. It\u2019s very much like the technique of producing constant lies. You know, I don\u2019t even have to go through it. The assiduous fact-checkers tot them up. I think it\u2019s maybe 20,000 by now or something. And he\u2019s laughing all the way. This is perfect. You tell constant lies, what happens is the concept of truth just disappears.

It starts on February 24th and ends with Donald Trump claiming March 17th and Hannity saying March 18th that they had always taken the pandemic seriously. This is \u201cSaluting the Heroes of the Coronavirus Pandumbic.\u201d SEANHANNITY:Tonight I can report the sky is absolutely falling. We are all doomed. The end is near. The apocalypse is imminent, and you\u2019re going to all die. Or at least that\u2019s what the media mob would like you to think. RUSHLIMBAUGH:Yeah, I\u2019m dead right on this. The coronavirus is the common cold, folks. The hype of this thing as a pandemic, as the Andromeda Strain, as \u201coh my god, if you get it, you\u2019re dead.\u201d PETEHEGSETH:This is one of those cases where the more I learn about coronavirus, the less concerned I am. There\u2019s a lot of hyperbole. LOUDOBBS:The national left-wing media playing up fears of the coronavirus. TOMILAHREN:The sky is falling because we have a few dozen cases of coronavirus on a cruise ship? I am far more concerned with stepping on a used heroin needle than I am getting the coronavirus. But maybe that\u2019s just me. JEANINEPIRRO:It\u2019s a virus like the flu. All the talk about coronavirus being so much more deadly doesn\u2019t reflect reality. DR.MARCSIEGEL:This virus should be compared to the flu, because at worst \u2014 at worst, worst-case scenario \u2014 it could be the flu. GERALDORIVERA:The far more deadly, more lethal threat right now is not the coronavirus, it\u2019s this \u2014 it\u2019s the ordinary, old flu. People are dying right now. STEVEDOOCY:The flu is here, everywhere. GERALDORIVERA:Nobody has died yet in the United States, as far as we know, from this disease. STEVEDOOCY:That\u2019s right. LAURAINGRAHAM:And the facts are actually pretty reassuring. But you\u2019d never know it, watching all this stuff. JESSEWATTERS:You want to know how I really feel about the coronavirus, Juan? If I get it, I\u2019ll beat it. I\u2019m not afraid of the coronavirus, and no one else should be that afraid, either. MATTSCHLAPP:It is very, very difficult to contract this virus.

REP.DEVINNUNES:One of the things you can do, if you\u2019re healthy, you and your family, it\u2019s a great time to just go out, go to a local restaurant. MARIABARTIROMO:Yeah. REP.DEVINNUNES:Likely, you can get in, get in easily. NEWSANCHOR:Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz mocked concerns about the spread of the virus by wearing a gas mask on Capitol Hill.

These are perhaps his senior advisers, as they continually played this down. Do you hold President Trump responsible? Would you say he has blood on his hands?",
    "output": "NOAMCHOMSKY:There\u2019s no question. Trump makes some crazy statement. It\u2019s then amplified by the Fox News echo chamber. The next day, he says the opposite. That\u2019s echoed; the echo chamber amplifies that. Notice that the tone \u2014 the tone of the reporting is interesting. It\u2019s all with perfect confidence, not what any sane, rational person would say \u2014 \u201cWe really don\u2019t know. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. This is the way things look today.\u201d There\u2019s nothing like that. Absolute confidence. No matter what the dear leader says, we amplify it. And it\u2019s an interesting dialogue. They amplify what he says. Sean Hannity can say, \u201cThis is the greatest move that was ever made in the history of the world.\u201d And the next morning, Trump tunes in toFox & Friends, listens to whatever is said. That becomes his thought for the day. It\u2019s an interaction, Murdoch and Trump moving literally to try to destroy the country and destroy the world, because in the background, we should never forget, is a far greater threat that is coming closer and closer while Trump is leading the way to destruction. He has some assistance. So, down on the southern part of the hemisphere, there\u2019s another madman, i.e. Jair Bolsonaro, who\u2019s trying to vie with Trump to see who can be the worst criminal on the planet. He\u2019s telling the Brazilians, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just a cold. Brazilians don\u2019t get viruses. We\u2019re immune to them.\u201d His health minister and other officials are trying to butt in and say, \u201cLook, this is really serious.\u201d The governors, many of them, fortunately, are ignoring what he says. But Brazil is facing a terrible crisis. It\u2019s actually gotten to the point where in the favelas, you know, these miserable slums, in Rio, where the government does nothing for the people, others have intervened to try to impose sensible restrictions, insofar as it\u2019s possible under those miserable conditions. Who? The crime gangs. The crime gangs, that torture the population, have moved in to try to impose health standards. The indigenous population is facing a virtual genocide, which won\u2019t bother Bolsonaro. He doesn\u2019t think they should be there anyway. Meanwhile, while all this is going on, scientific papers are coming out warning that in 15 years the Amazon is going to shift from being a net carbon sink to a net CO2 emitter. That\u2019s devastating for Brazil \u2014 in fact, for the whole world. So, we have the Colossus of the North, as it\u2019s called, in the hands of sociopaths, who are doing whatever they can to harm the country and the world. And the Colossus of the South, as it\u2019s been called, is, in its own way, doing the same thing. I\u2019m able to follow this pretty closely because my wife Valeria is Brazilian and keeps me up to date with the news that\u2019s coming out in Brazil. And it\u2019s simply shocking to see. But meanwhile, other countries are reacting sensibly. So, as soon as the news started coming out from China \u2014 and there was plenty of news right away, contrary to what is being claimed \u2014 the countries on the Chinese periphery began to react \u2014 Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore \u2014 quite effectively. Some of them have it basically under control. New Zealand has apparently quashed the coronavirus, maybe almost completely, with a lockdown right away, an immediate lockdown for a couple of weeks, and seems to have come close to ending it. You look into Europe, and most of Europe just dithered, but some countries, the better-organized countries, did act right away. It\u2019s very striking. It would be very useful for Americans to compare Trump\u2019s ravings, of the kind you illustrated, with Angela Merkel\u2019s, German chancellor, her sober, factual account and talk to the German people, describing exactly what\u2019s happening and what has to be done."

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: Noam, the outgoing Trump administration was the worst thing that could have happened for the environment. Trump rolled out dozens of deregulation policies. His administration reversed the Obama-rule on methane emissions, even though methane, the natural ingredient in natural gas, is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Meanwhile he denied the science of climate change and withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement. What can we expect from the Biden administration on climate emergency, especially now that the Senate is under Democratic control, and why is it so important that the U.S. should rejoin the Paris Agreement?",
    "output": "Rejoining the Paris Agreement is imperative, but only a bare beginning. The Agreement was an important step forward. It is, however, very weak, not even close to what has to be done. It also has no teeth: it is voluntary, no binding commitments. The primary reason for the weakness is the U.S. Republican Party, which would not permit anything that went much beyond symbolism. The Party is still there. In fact, it just achieved overwhelming success in the November 2020 elections, winning at every level except for the White House, where distaste for Trump\u2019s antics prevailed. That victory is quite astonishing if only in light of the fact that the Party\u2019s leaders were responsible for killing tens if not hundreds of thousands of Americans in the preceding months \u2014 not to speak of racing to the abyss of environmental catastrophe, a fact that scarcely registered. The Party is still there, a dominating force, poised to ensure that the country is ungovernable, a specialty of Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell as he proclaimed with pride during the Obama years and demonstrated with considerable success. And Trump is not gone, far from it. A large majority of the Republican voting base regards him as their leader, if not savior. They can be whipped up to threaten any Republican office holder who dares to depart from Trump-McConnell malevolence, much as the Tea Party was organized and used for that purpose, with plenty of funding from powerful concentrations of capital. It may be recalled that as recently as 2008, during the McCain campaign, Republicans were willing to entertain the thought that there might be some problem about destroying the climate that sustains life. With virtual unanimity, they succumbed to a juggernaut launched by David Koch to extirpate that heresy, a victory that remains in place. With Trump setting himself up as the \u201ctrue victor\u201d in the elections, stirring up poisons in the ways he masters very well, there will be serious barriers to returning the country to a moderately civilized course. How serious the barriers are we saw right before our eyes on January 6, a fateful day. Ever since he gained office, Trump has been working hard to turn the country into a tin-pot dictatorship under his rule, a process we have been discussing regularly in this forum as it has unfolded. To repeat briefly, there have been three prongs to the assault against the world by this miserable creature: The first one alone suffices to establish him as arguably the most dangerous political figure in human history, a truism that has been hard for many to contemplate. Right now we are witnessing the next step in his dedication to destroy American democracy. He has been bragging for years about the \u201cTough Guys for Trump\u201d \u2014 his Black and Brown Shirts. On January 6, he unleashed them, encouraging their violence and destruction as they broke into the Capitol Building to prevent formal ratification of his electoral defeat, which, it seems, he will never acknowledge no matter how much destruction is caused by his malevolence. In his disgraceful performance calling on his tough guys to go home \u2014 for now \u2014 he could not refrain from stirring up more poisons with brazen lies about how his \u201clandslide victory\u201d was stolen by evil forces, doing what he can to ensure maximum damage to the country to which he intends to return triumphantly to complete the wreckage. That is only one force the Biden administration will have to overcome to save the country, and the world, from environmental catastrophe. Another is the Democratic National Committee (DNC) \u2014 Clintonite, neoliberal, oriented to Wall Street and the donor class. The intraparty conflict began to emerge even before the election. One central element was global warming. Under significant popular pressure, the Biden-Harris environmental program moved in a fairly progressive direction; insufficient, but a considerable step beyond predecessors. As we\u2019ve discussed before, the DNC reacted by cutting it back. The impediments to the urgently needed policy are extreme, but there are also popular forces that cannot be ignored. They are imposing what the powerful call \u201creputational risks\u201d that have to be dealt with, sometimes in meaningful ways. And power does not make those who wield it totally impervious to human concerns. Whatever the mix of factors may be, there are changes taking place within the institutions that dominate the society. European-based fossil fuel companies are shifting toward sustainable energy. Bank of America, the last holdout, joined other major banks in refusing to join Trump\u2019s last-ditch effort to destroy the Arctic nature reserve. Popular activism can influence those who own the country.... And it can influence the government as well, despite the impediments over a spectrum from the DNC to the far right. The outcome of this struggle for survival will determine what we can expect from the Biden administration."

So adding emissions from China and the U.S. alone gets us to 42 percent of the global total. But we can also look at this same statistic from the opposite direction: even after combining the emissions levels for China and the U.S., we still haven\u2019t accounted for fully 58 percent of the global total. We can also push the individual country emissions figures a bit further, and include all 27 countries of the European Union (EU) along with the United States and China. This adds another 10 percent to current total emissions, getting us to 52 percent of global emissions with China, the United States and the 27 EU countries combined. Therefore, if we only pay attention to China, the U.S. and all EU countries, we still are neglecting the countries responsible for generating nearly half of current total global emissions. The point is that every place does matter if we really are going to hit the target of net zero global emissions by no later than 2050. Zero emissions does meanzero, everywhere.

Raising living standards in low-income countries will entail providing affordable energy, for people to light and heat their homes, for cooking and to improve transportation systems. It will also mean that, especially in rural areas of the developing world, women will be able to stop spending hours every day gathering wood to burn for cooking and heating. The energy supply that will deliver this rise in mass living standards will need to be renewable energy, provided at high efficiency levels \u2014 solar and wind energy primarily, but also some geothermal, small-scale hydro and low-emissions bioenergy. Developing countries therefore need large-scale investments to build clean energy infrastructures. By my estimates, this will cost about 2 to 3 percent of overall spending (GDP) in these economies every year between now and 2050. That is not an overwhelming amount of money; it means that 97 percent of the economy\u2019s overall spending can be devoted to other things, like growing food in abundance, creating good-quality housing, transportation, education, health care, as well as producing some local manufactured goods. Still, that 3 percent of total spending needs to come from somewhere. As a basic standard of fairness, most of the funds should be provided by the high-income countries. This is because the high-income countries, starting with the U.S. but also including Canada, Western Europe, Japan and Australia are primarily responsible for loading up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases and causing climate change. There are straightforward ways for the high-income countries to raise these investment funds, including cutting military spending, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies and having the major central banks, starting with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, purchase Green Bonds from the governments of low-income countries at zero- or near-zero interest rates. That said, it should also be clear that in the low-income countries, as well as the high-income countries, clean energy investments will pay for themselves over time. This is because investing in dramatically raising energy efficiency levels will mean that people will be able to, for example, heat and light their homes with much less energy. In addition, investments in renewable energy will mean lower prices for the energy you do have to buy. It is already the case that, in both low- and high-income economies, average prices for renewable energy are comparable to or lower than those for fossil fuels and nuclear power, and these renewable energy costs are also falling."

    "output": "Pollin:Investments to build a clean energy economy will be a major source of job creation in all regions of the world. Countries at all levels of development will experience significant gains in job creation relative to maintaining their existing fossil fuel infrastructures. Research that I have conducted with co-workers has found this relationship to hold in Brazil, China, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Puerto Rico, South Africa, South Korea, Spain and the United States. As a rough approximation, I estimate the increase in employment worldwide would be in the range of 160 million jobs per year on average between 2021 and 2030. At the same time, workers and communities throughout the world whose livelihoods depend on people consuming oil, coal and natural gas will lose out in the clean energy transition. It is only a modest exaggeration to say that the fate of the planet depends on whether we can put in place just transition policies for these workers and communities that will be negatively impacted by the decline and shuttering of the fossil fuel industry. Just transition policies are certainly justified according to any standard of fairness. But they are also a matter of strategic politics. In the absence of such adjustment assistance programs operating at a major scale, the workers and communities facing retrenchment from the clean energy investment project will, predictably and understandably, fight to defend their communities and livelihoods. This in turn will create unacceptable delays in proceeding with effective climate stabilization policies. Considering the U.S. economy, co-workers and I have estimated that a rough high-end figure for such a program would average less than $1 billion per year over 2021 to 2030 \u2014 that is, well below one one-hundredth of 1 percent of U.S. GDP. This level of funding would provide strong support in two areas: (1) income, retraining and relocation support for workers facing retrenchments; and (2) guaranteeing the pensions for workers in the affected industries. Comparable programs will of course need to be implemented in other country settings. The proportional costs as a share of GDP in all other economies is not likely to be much higher than the U.S. figure. In short, generous just transition policies for workers and communities that are currently dependent on the fossil fuel industry need to be included as a centerpiece of all Green New Deal programs throughout the world."

    "output": "To begin with, the climate emergency is a human emergency \u2014 in fact, an emergency for almost all living things. We are not just racing to destroy ourselves, a careening course accelerated by an array of villainous masters of the private economy and the state, but also the animal kingdom and much of the rest of the organic world. Human destructiveness, culminating in the Anthropocene, reaches levels of depravity that can hardly be captured in words, at least mine. Nor can words capture the failure to comprehend what is happening before our eyes. Working people are humans, in fact the large majority of the species. A human emergency is an issue for labor by definition. More specifically, overcoming this emergency will require great changes in the kinds of work that people do, over a very broad range. One obvious case is fossil fuel workers. They will have to be helped in the transition to a new economy \u2014 one in which they can have better lives and work, a topic that Bob has studied in detail. If Democratic party leaders had cared enough about working people, they would have been organizing in oil-producing areas instead of conceding them to the Republicans with their easy and cynical tales of how Biden\u2019s goal is to take away their jobs and destroy their communities with some liberal hoax about climate. Another clear case is agricultural practices, which will have to be radically changed if we hope to survive. Constructing a new and much better society \u2014 and one that can survive \u2014 should open up a vast array of new and much better employment opportunities in manufacturing, construction, education, health, in fact, every area of life. Throughout modern history, organized labor and labor activists have been in the lead in creating a better world. Reagan and Thatcher, and those behind them, knew very well what they were doing when they launched the neoliberal assault on global society by targeting unions, the main line of defense for working people in the bitter class war that they sharply accelerated. Labor has also been in the lead in the areas of our current concern. One of the earliest and most far-sighted environmentalists was the great labor leader Tony Mazzocchi, a high official of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union (OCAW), workers on the front line in enduring the effects of the industrial pollution that is destroying the planet. Reviving his Labor party initiative is not an idle dream. Along with badly needed revival of the labor movement, it might be one prong in the broad effort that is imperative if we are to escape from the catastrophe we are creating and move on to a better life."

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou:In 1992, Francis Fukuyama published an intellectually embarrassing book titledThe End of History and the Last Man, in which he prophesied the \u201cend of history\u201d after the collapse of the communist bloc, arguing that liberal democracy would become the world\u2019s \u201cfinal form of human government.\u201d However, what has happened in this decade in particular is that the institutions and values of liberal democracy have come under attack by scores of authoritarian leaders all over the world, and extreme nationalism, xenophobia and \u201csoft fascist\u201d tendencies have begun reshaping the political landscape in Europe and the United States. How do you explain the resurgence of political authoritarianism in the early part of the 21st century?",
    "output": "The \u201cpolitical landscape\u201d is indeed ominous. While today\u2019s political and social circumstances are much less dire, still they do call to mind Antonio Gramsci\u2019s warning from Mussolini\u2019s prison cells about the severe crisis of his day, which \u201cconsists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born [and] in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.\u201d One morbid symptom is the resurgence of political authoritarianism, a highly important matter that is properly receiving a great deal of attention in public debate. But \u201ca great deal of public attention\u201d should always be a warning sign: Does the shaping of the issues reflect power interests, which are diverting attention from what may be more significant factors behind the general concerns? In the present case, I think that is so, and before turning to the very significant question of the resurgence of political authoritarianism, I\u2019d like to bring up related matters that do not seem to me to receive the attention they merit, and in fact are almost totally excluded from the extensive public attention. It\u2019s entirely true that \u201cthe institutions and values of liberal democracy are under attack\u201d to an unusual extent, but not only by authoritarian leaders, and not for the first time. I presume all would agree that primary among the values of liberal democracy is that governments should be responsive to voters. If that is not the case, \u201cliberal democracy\u201d is a farce. It has been well established that it is not the case. Ample work in mainstream political science shows that a majority of voters are not represented by their own elected representatives, who listen to different voices \u2014 the voices of the donor class, great wealth and the corporate sector (Martin Gilens,Affluence and Influence:Economic Inequality and Political Power in America, Princeton University Press, 2014; Benjamin Page and Martin Gilens,Democracy in America?What Has Gone Wrong and What We Can Do About It, University of Chicago press, 2017; Larry Bartels,Unequal Democracy:The Political Economy of the New Gilded Age, 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 2018, among others). Furthermore, the penetrating work of Thomas Ferguson reveals that for a long time, elections have been substantially bought, including Congress, continuing right to the present, 2016. These facts alone show that the furor about alleged Russian interference with our pristine democratic process reveals profound indoctrination \u2014 in capitalist, not democratic, values. Furthermore, those who find foreign interference to be especially troublesome despite its marginality should clearly be looking elsewhere. It is not even in question that Israel interferes massively in US elections and governance, proudly and ostentatiously. One recent case that was unusually brazen was in 2015, when Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed Congress without even informing President Obama in order to undermine his Iran program, a mere fragment of Israel\u2019s constant and far-reaching efforts to influence US politics. Putting aside these secondary matters, the major attack on the institutions and values of liberal democracy is by the powerful business classes, intensifying since Reagan as both political parties have drifted toward greater subordination to their interests \u2014 the Republicans to such an extreme that by now they barely can be considered a political party. Anyone who finds this surprising must be uninformed about American society and how it functions. By now, as business power has been unleashed by its servants in the Republican Party, the traditional business attack on \u201cthe institutions and values of liberal democracy\u201d has reached levels not seen since the Gilded Age, if even then. Of course, it is quite legal to buy elections, to send lobbyists to congressional offices to write legislation, and in other ways \u201cto shape public policy in a way that serves [private power\u2019s] narrow interests\u201d \u2014 indeed, these comprise \u201can essential, nonaccidental part of ... business strategy,\u201d Zephyr Teachout writes in a valuable study. Investigation has shown, she adds, that a CEO\u2019s investment in changing laws to decrease corporate tax rates yields a vastly greater return than investment in reducing cost of production. Small wonder that all of this is normal business strategy. Teachout cites a Supreme Court decision of 1874 which concluded that, \u201cIf any of the great corporations of the country were to hire adventurers who make market of themselves [for] the promotion of their private interests, the moral sense of every right-minded man would instinctively denounce the employer and employed as steeped in corruption.\u201d That was, of course, before the ideology of business supremacy had risen to the level of \u201chegemonic common sense,\u201d in Gramscian terms. The sharp transition well illustrates the force of indoctrination in a society with a powerful and highly class-conscious business community. The Reagan-Thatcher project of enhancing untrammeled business power, carried forward and extended by their successors, has been the political reflection of a dedicated and coordinated campaign by the business classes to reverse the \u201ccrisis of democracy\u201d of the 1960s that deeply troubled liberal international elites, who devoted the first major publication of the Trilateral Commission to this serious malady. Their prime concern was the increased engagement of popular classes in the political arena to press their demands, all of which imposes too much pressure and the state, threatening (though this remains implicit) the dominance of the business world. As the American rapporteur, Harvard professor of government Samuel Huntington, observed nostalgically, \u201cTruman had been able to govern the country with the cooperation of a relatively small number of Wall Street lawyers and bankers,\u201d but those happy days were disappearing under the attack of the great majority, whose role in a liberal democracy is to be passive and acquiescent, a doctrine with a rich pedigree, which I\u2019ve reviewed elsewhere. That was the liberal end of the political spectrum. Toward the conservative end, at the same time, the influential \u201cPowell memorandum,\u201d directed to the Chamber of Commerce by corporate lawyer Lewis Powell (later appointed to the Supreme Court by Richard Nixon), called for open war by the business world to defend itself from the virtual takeover of the country by radical forces that were destroying \u201cfree enterprise\u201d under the leadership of Ralph Nader, Herbert Marcuse and other \u201cdangerous extremists.\u201d The messages are pretty much the same, but the rhetoric is quite different. The liberal rhetoric is largely reserved, while the business rhetoric reaches the frenzied pitch of a 3-year-old who has all the toys and laments that one might be taken away. The business world, of course, did not need these reminders to dedicate its resources to reversing the democratic progress and highly successful regulated capitalism of the postwar era that was indeed infringing on business power, and crucially threatening the rate of profit, as political economist Robert Brenner has shown. The neoliberal counterattack substantially beat back these threats, sharply increasing private power and the wealth of a tiny segment of the population while leaving the majority to face economic stagnation or decline, increasingly precarious lives, and the natural loss of political influence as concentrated private economic power gains even greater dominance than before. All of this continues under the revival from the housing-financial crisis that proceeds under Obama and Trump. The latest report of the Department of Labor finds that, \u201cFrom May 2017 to May 2018, real average hourly earnings decreased 0.1 percent, seasonally adjusted. The decrease in real average hourly earnings combined with a 0.6-percent increase in the average workweek resulted in a 0.5-percent increase in real average weekly earnings over this period.\u201d Meanwhile, surging corporate profits are inflated still further by the tax scam that is the jewel in the crown of Trump\u2019s Republican Party, overwhelmingly used for buyouts and other devices to enrich the wealthy rather than productive investment that would benefit society and lift wages. The other side of the coin is the Reagan-Thatcher assault on unions, now advanced by the authorization of right-to-scrounge laws (in Orwellian terminology, \u201cright-to-work\u201d laws) by the most reactionary Supreme Court in over a century. The guiding doctrine is to create a world of isolated individuals at the mercy of concentrated private power in accord with the Thatcherite doctrine that \u201cthere is no society,\u201d Thatcher\u2019s unwitting paraphrase of Marx\u2019s bitter condemnation of authoritarian leaders who sought to turn society into a \u201csack of potatoes.\u201d There are other sources for the malaise of the general population. The radical financialization of the economy during the neoliberal years and the prioritization of shareholder value, expedited by Reagan\u2019s \u201cChicago Boys,\u201d has shifted corporate behavior sharply from the retain-and-invest model of the great growth years of regimented capitalism to the \u201cbuyback economy\u201d of the neoliberal reaction, matters explored with much insight by William Lazonick. Apple, the world\u2019s largest corporation in market value, was once devoted to product innovation and development. Under its new CEO, Tim Cook, it has become the \u201cbuyback king,\u201d enriching shareholders (and management). Others are doing much the same. Lazonick estimates that \u201ctrillions of dollars that could have been spent on productive investment have instead been used to buy back stock in order to boost share prices,\u201d enriching the rich but not providing meaningful and steady work or useful goods. The Republican tax scam of 2018 is having the same effects, all to the detriment of working people and the general population. The rapid increase in speculation has had similar consequences. The same is true of the repeated financial crises following deregulation, severely harming the poor and working people, though no longer the culprits in the financial industry, who are bailed out by the public and emerge richer than before. There are remedies, but their advocates remain for now at the fringes of the political economy. Though perhaps not for long. These are, to be sure, generalities. Like most complex processes, the rise of authoritarian leaders and the concomitant anti-social tendencies are over-determined. There are many more specific factors but the essence, I think, is along the lines just outlined."

What\u2019s going on? Is something wrong with today\u2019s democracy?",
    "output": "Here specific causes intrude. In the case of Western democracies \u2014 Trump, Western Europe \u2014 what\u2019s wrong with today\u2019s democracy is its decline, with the attendant attack on prospects for a decent life as the political system falls even more than usual under the control of concentrated private power and hence becomes less responsive to human needs. These are natural consequences of the concentration of wealth under the neoliberal assault against the social democratic tendencies of the early postwar decades. It should be recalled that the Great Depression and World War II unleashed radical democratic forces over much of the world, and although the reaction of the business world was quick to come (e.g., Taft-Hartley in 1947), it was muted until the economic disruptions of the 1970s, which provided an opportunity for vigorous class war. It\u2019s also worth recalling the rather belated recognition in 1978 by United Auto Workers President Doug Fraser that businessmen had \u201cchosen to wage a one-sided class war in this country, a war against working people, the unemployed, the poor, the minorities, the very young and the very old, and even many in the middle class of our society\u201d and had \u201cbroken and discarded the fragile, unwritten compact previously existing during a period of growth and progress.\u201d In fact, the class war was underway in the latter days of the pre-war New Deal years, but it was not yet one-sided, since a vigorous labor movement existed \u2014 the target of bitter and increasingly one-sided class war in the postwar years. In Europe, the attack on democracy is amplified by the strongly undemocratic institutions of the European Union. Major decisions over policy are made by the unelected Troika \u2014 European Commission, International Monetary Fund (IMF), European Central Bank \u2014 with the northern banks right at their shoulders. The population has little to say, and knows it \u2014 a large reason for the general collapse of the centrist parties that have governed the countries since World War II. In a very revealing inquiry, economist Mark Weisbrot reviews the reports of the regular IMF consultations with member governments of the European Union. He discovered \u201ca remarkably consistent and disturbing pattern.\u201d The financial crisis was exploited as an opportunity to lock in the neoliberal reforms: spending cuts in the public sector rather than tax increases, reduced benefits and public services, cuts in health care, undermining of collective bargaining, and in general, moves to create a society \u201cwith less bargaining power for labor and lower wages, more inequality and poverty, a smaller government and social safety nets, and measures that reduce growth and employment.\u201d \u201cThe IMF papers,\u201d Weisbrot concludes, \u201cdetail the agenda of Europe\u2019s decision-makers, and they have accomplished quite a bit of it over the past five years.\u201d The agenda is quite familiar in the US and in fact, wherever the neoliberal assault has proceeded. In England, Thatcher-Major and Blair\u2019s New Labour, followed by Tory austerity, had similar effects. The Corbyn movement is an encouraging reaction, bitterly opposed by the Labour establishment and most of the media. The other cases mentioned have their own special features. Putin seems to have been genuinely popular throughout his tenure. Crimeans, it appears, support the takeover by Russia. There seemed to be possibilities for social democratic developments in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, possibly even for mutually supportive linkages to social democratic Europe. Such hopes were dashed by the harsh effects of the US-backed market reforms, which devastated the economy and led to millions of deaths, along with opening the way for immense corruption as oligarchs took over state assets. Putin was seen by the public as a corrective to the neoliberal disaster and the decline of Russia on the world scene. Authoritarian no doubt, often brutal, but, it seems, popular. In Israel, too, the right-wing nationalist-religious coalition is genuinely popular. Threats to Netanyahu are primarily from his right. This is quite a change from the time when Israel conquered Palestinian lands in the 1967, and soon set forth on its illegal settlement programs. The change was predicted early on by those who understood the natural dynamics of crushing people under your jackboot. One commentator who was particularly outspoken was the respected Israeli sage Yeshayahu Leibowitz. He condemned the occupation bitterly, not because of concern for the Palestinians, for whose fate he expressed only contempt, but because of the predictable effect on Jews, who, he warned, would become \u201cJudeo-Nazis\u201d as they carried out the tasks of repression and displacement. The signs by now are dramatic, both in actions and in legislation, both with regard to the criminal acts in the occupied territories and the shift to unconcealed racism at home. The occupied territories include Gaza, despite Israel\u2019s claim to the contrary, which is not even accepted by its loyal US supporter. In the full knowledge that the home of 2 million people is likely to become literally \u201cunlivable\u201d within a few years, as international monitors have predicted, Israel maintains its stranglehold, designed officially to keep the population on a \u201cdiet\u201d while the self-described \u201cmost moral army in the world\u201d pounds away with atrocities that are appalling the world. Turkey, too, is a special case, with a long and complex history since the current Turkish state took form after World War I. Keeping to recent times, in the \u201890s, Turkey was the scene of some of the worst atrocities of the period during the state terror campaign against the Kurds. Tens of thousands were killed, thousands of towns and villages were destroyed, hundreds of thousands \u2014 maybe millions \u2014 were driven from their homes, some now barely surviving in abandoned buildings in Istanbul. The main support for the state crimes was Washington: Clinton provided 80 percent of the arms in an increasing flow as atrocities increased. Little was reported even though the major press had bureaus in Turkey, of course. Much of the information available comes from the detailed reports of the outstanding researcher for Human Rights Watch, Jonathan Sugden \u2014 so outstanding that he was finally expelled by the government. Particularly significant were a remarkable group of Turkish intellectuals \u2013 leading writers, artists, journalists, publishers and others \u2014 who not only protested the crimes, but undertook civil disobedience, facing and sometimes enduring long and severe punishment. I know of no group like them anywhere. By the turn of the century, the situation was improving, soon quite considerably, including the early Erdo\u011fan years. But soon regression began under his leadership, and it has become extremely severe. Turkey held the worst record in the world for persecuting journalists, and the repression has extended to academics and many others. Vicious attacks on Kurdish areas have increased. The country is divided between a secular liberal-left sector and a deeply religious, mostly rural population. A dedicated Islamist, Erdo\u011fan has rallied support among this sector and is relying on it to create a harsh and repressive authoritarian state with strong Islamist elements. What is happening is particularly painful to observe, not just because of the crimes, but because of the hopeful prospects that were lying ahead only a few years ago and the fact that Turkey could serve as a valuable bridge, culturally as well as economically, between West and East. Hungary is another special case. It is a cultural/linguistic island, which has had remarkable cultural achievements and also an ugly record of fascism and cooperation with the Nazis. From what I have read \u2014 I have no close knowledge \u2014 the country has long been obsessed with the fear of decline, even disappearance \u2014 fears exacerbated by the passage of refugees through Hungary to Western Europe. The population is declining, partly from low fertility, partly from a large exodus to the West. Orb\u00e1n has exploited these fears to construct an \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d dedicated to \u201csaving Hungary\u201d and \u201ctraditional values,\u201d with the usual xenophobic and racist elements of such appeals. There\u2019s a good deal more to say about racism in Europe, not visible when the populations are highly homogenous, but quickly apparent as soon as there is any \u201ccontamination\u201d by those who are a bit different. And there is no need to comment on the history of the Jews, and of the Roma right to the present."

What\u2019s wrong with the idea of the US and Russia working together to address major international issues facing the world today, including the threat of nuclear weapons? What\u2019s your own reaction to this matter? Was Trump wrong? Was he being \u201canti-American\u201d?",
    "output": "There\u2019s surely nothing wrong with the US and Russia seeking rapprochement and cooperation on such issues. It is essential for hopes for a better future, even survival. Russia should not refuse to deal with the US and (were it imaginable) impose sanctions on the US and UK because they invaded and devastated Iraq with all of the hideous regional consequences, or (with France) destroyed Libya with terrible effects from West Africa to the Levant, along with other crimes too numerous to mention. Or conversely (putting aside the scale of crimes). There are numerous issues on which the countries must cooperate, and sometimes do, as in Syria to avoid clashes that could set off war. The needs are far greater at the Russian border, where, as a result of NATO expansion and build-up of forces, accidents with indescribable consequences could easily occur. There are many other cases where serious interchange is necessary. On nuclear issues, even more so. As we\u2019ve discussed elsewhere, Obama\u2019s programs of modernization of nuclear weapons increased \u201ckilling power\u201d sufficiently to create \u201cexactly what one would expect to see, if a nuclear-armed state were planning to have the capacity to fight and win a nuclear war by disarming enemies with a surprise first strike,\u201d as explained in an important study in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Trump\u2019s nuclear programs enhance the threat even beyond, with new and very dangerous weapons systems and severe lowering of the threshold for nuclear war \u2014 an existential threat to Russia, and the world; even the attacker would be devastated by a first-strike. Under George W. Bush, the US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, another serious threat to Russia. Russian weapons initiatives and reactions also enhance the threat of terminal destruction. Turning to Trump, his actions make no sense at all if they are guided by some geopolitical strategy. On the one hand, he is talking politely with Putin (some say genuflecting) and calling for reduction of tensions, while on the other hand, he is significantly escalating tensions and threats. The nuclear program just mentioned is one very serious example. He is also sending arms to Ukraine and increasing NATO forces and operations on the Russian border \u2014 actions that any Russian leader would regard as a severe threat. Harsher sanctions have been imposed on Russia, which is by no means unaware of the increasing threats \u2013 how could they be? The business press, citing US Treasury reports, observes that Russia is \u201cliquidating dollar assets at a record pace, selling four-fifths of its cache of U.S. government debt, $81 billion worth, over a two-month period\u201d in order to safeguard assets in case relations continue to deteriorate. While Trump\u2019s policies make no sense from a geostrategic perspective, they fall into place on the assumption that he is continuing to pursue his \u201cMe First\u201d agenda, damn the consequences for the world, matters we\u2019ve discussed before. The agenda requires maintaining the loyalty of his base and ensuring that they will remain loyal if the Mueller investigation comes up with something that damages him. The centerpiece of his press conference with Putin, bitterly condemned by elite opinion, was his effort to discredit Mueller. The tactic is succeeding quite well. A large majority of Republicans approve of the way Trump dealt with Putin, andpollsshow that Mueller\u2019s public image is at an all-time low. Meanwhile, the sharp escalation and threats satisfy the national security hawks. The latter constitute a broad spectrum. While it is sometimes hard to believe, we cannot overlook the fact that the most highly regarded moderates firmly uphold doctrines that are, quite literally, too outlandish to discuss. For example, Richard Haass, a respected scholar and diplomat and long-time president of the influential Council on Foreign Relations, instructs us with a straight face that \u201cInternational order for 4 centuries has been based on non-interference in the internal affairs of others and respect for sovereignty. Russia has violated this norm by seizing Crimea and by interfering in the 2016 US election. We must deal [with] Putin\u2019s Russia as the rogue state it is.\u201d Words fail."

    "input": "In Israel, a controversial bill about the \u201cJewish nation-state\u201d was just passed that makes no mention of minority rights. Is there something new behind the passing of this bill that wasn\u2019t always a reality from Israel\u2019s standpoint of view?",
    "output": "Regrettably, within Israel itself, the new nationality law of July 2018 was not very controversial, though it has appalled liberal opinion throughout the world. Rather typical is what is happening in the US, which since the 1967 war, has been Israel\u2019s leading supporter. For a long period, Israel was the darling of liberal and progressive opinion. By today, that has changed considerably. \u201cAccording to a Pew Research Center survey in April [2018], self-described liberal Democrats were twice as likely to sympathize with Palestinians over Israel than they were only two years ago. Forty percent of liberals sympathized more with Palestinians, the most since 2001, while 33 percent sympathized more with Israel.\u201d Support for Israel has shifted to the ultranationalist right and Christian evangelicals \u2014 many of whom combine passionate support for Israel with the doctrine that the Second Coming, perhaps very soon, will consign all Jews to the torments of eternal perdition apart from a very few who will find Christ in time \u2014 a level of anti-Semitism unmatched even in Nazi Germany. Israel is well aware that it is losing support among sectors of world opinion that have at least some concern for human and civil rights. It is therefore seeking to expand its base of support to the East, primarily to China and India, the latter becoming a very natural ally for a number of reasons, including the drift in both societies toward ultranationalism, reactionary internal policies and hatred of Islam. It is also firming up what have been tacit alliances with the most reactionary and brutal Arab states, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, joined now by Egypt under the current harsh military dictatorship. The new nationality law declares Israel to be the nation-state of the Jewish people, downgrades the status of Arabic and formally authorizes Jewish-only communities. It does break some new ground, but not very much. What is new is primarily the elevation of these racist principles to the Basic Law \u2014 constitutional status. Long ago, Israel\u2019s highest court determined that Israel is \u201cthe sovereign state of the Jewish people\u201d ... but not the state of its 20 percent non-Jewish citizens, essentially the same doctrine. One of the few articulate critics of the new law, the fine Israeli writer Yitzhak Laor, reminds us that in debates on the Land Law of 1960, Zerach Warhaftig, a founder of the National Religious Party and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, declared that, \u201cWe wish it to be clear that the land of Israel belongs to the nation of Israel. Nation of Israelis a wider concept than the nation that lives in Zion, because the nation of Israel is found in the entire world.... [In this new law] there is a very great judicial novelty: we are giving a legal cover to the regulations of the Keren Kayemet leYisrael [Jewish National Fund, or JNF]\u201d (translated from Hebrew). The JNF regulations in turn obligate the organization to work for the benefit of \u201cpersons of Jewish race, religion, or origin.\u201d It may be added that these radical violations of civil rights are funded by American taxpayers thanks to the tax-free status of the JNF as a charitable organization. Warhaftig was quite right almost 60 years ago. An array of legal and administrative rules was established to ensure that the JNF would have authority over all state lands \u2013 93 percent of the territory of the country \u2013 hence, authority to ensure that lands would be reserved for Jews alone, with minor and derisory exceptions. Details are spelled out and documented in myTowards a New Cold War(1982). Laor reminds us that since the law was established, \u201c700 settlements were established, all for Jews, apart from a few cities for [displaced] Bedouins (which merit ridicule).\u201d Meanwhile, the 20 percent non-Jewish minority has been restricted to the 2 percent of the land allotted to them when the state was established 70 years ago. In 2000, the racist land administration arrangements finally reached Israel\u2019s High Court. It issued a narrow ruling that granted the petitioners, a professional Arab couple, the right to move to the all-Jewish town of Katzir. Very soon, arrangements began to be contrived to get around the law, but now it is no longer necessary, since segregation is legally authorized by the Basic Law. Much of this should be familiar to Americans. New Deal public housing projects were restricted to whites by laws that remained in effect until the late 1960s, when it was too late to help African Americans because the postwar years of rapid and egalitarian growth, which offered them some opportunities, were coming to an end, and the neoliberal assault was soon to come, imposing stagnation. Another grim chapter in the history of racism in America. Also familiar to Americans is US isolation in support of such measures (with the attractive exceptions noted earlier), now reaching new levels in the Trump administration. In the last days of the Apartheid regime in South Africa, Reagan was alone in the world in supporting it, even denying the existence of Apartheid, even after Thatcher and Israel had abandoned the sinking ship. We might also recall that during the last throes of Apartheid, in 1988, the Reagan administration declared Nelson Mandela\u2019s African National Congress to be \u201cone of the more notorious terrorist groups\u201d in the world. While greatly honored internationally, Mandela remained on the US terrorist list until 2008, when at last a congressional resolution allowed him to enter the \u201cland of the free\u201d without special dispensation. Often, there is indeed little new under the sun."

    "output": "Unfortunately, the answer is all too clear. As their own practice consistently illustrates, the \u201cWestern democratic governments\u201d pursue similar policies with enthusiasm. It should be superfluous to illustrate, but since we live in an atmosphere of self-celebration, it might be useful to consider at least one example. Take the Congo, which should be one of the richest and most advanced countries of the world, with huge resources and no threats \u2014 from its neighbors, that is. When Europe was despoiling Africa, the Congo was the domain of King Leopold of Belgium, whose hideous crimes surpassed even the normal standards of the \u201cenlightened\u201d West. He didn\u2019t pass without censure. In the famous 11th edition of theBritannica, the article on the monarch lauds his achievements, but does add a phrase at the end saying that he treated his subjects harshly \u2013 slaughtering millions and ordering atrocious tortures to gain more rubber for his overflowing coffers. \u201cThe horror, the horror\u201d finally came to end in 1960, when Congo declared independence. Its leading figure was the young charismatic Patrice Lumumba, who might have extricated Congo from the misery of colonialism. But it was not to be. The CIA was assigned the task of murdering him, but the Belgians got there first, and together with other liberal democracies, helped plunge Congo back to terror and destruction under the leadership of the Western favorite, the murderous kleptomaniac Mobutu, who ensured that the riches of the Congo would flow in the right direction. Fast forwarding to today, all of those who enjoy smart phones and other technical delights benefit from the rich minerals of Eastern Congo, handed over to the multinationals hovering nearby by warring militias and marauders from US-backed Rwanda while the death toll mounts to many millions. That Western democracies should tolerate support for authoritarian regimes is not much of a mystery."

The United States has always had more power and influence over world affairs than, say, Taiwan and smaller countries in Asia.

Do you think American intellectuals have more responsibility than say, for example, Taiwanese intellectuals?",

So, somebody like me has more responsibility than, say, a homeless person begging on the street. They don\u2019t have the opportunities that I have and, by extension, if you\u2019re in the richest and most powerful country in world history, and it\u2019s a moderately democratic country so what you do matters, then you have greater responsibility."

    "output": "We are now busily destroying the planet. If we don\u2019t change course significantly, nothing else is going to matter. I\u2019m referring to the destruction of the environment, global warming, habitat destruction, destruction of the ocean \u2014 all proceeding very rapidly. As perhaps you saw yesterday, there was a report that came out, originally from the AFP, the French news agency, and circulated worldwide. It was a draft. They had somehow gotten ahold of the draft report of the IPCC \u2014 international monitors of the environment. Scientists who... the main scientific organization that produces the scientific consensus on the state of the environment, and it\u2019s much more dire than the past ones. The past ones have been serious enough. This one is much more serious. We have to move quickly to end the use of fossil fuels, to move to sustainable energy, to end habitat destruction, or else human life in any meaningful form will cease to exist. Well, what\u2019s our responsibility? To ensure that this happens. As an American intellectual in the United States right now. Well, the United States per capita emissions is way at the top among developed societies. China actually has greater total emissions but far lower per capita. And, of course, in the past emissions have been overwhelmingly the rich countries and, to be more precise, the rich people within the rich countries. They\u2019re the ones responsible for this and responsible for doing something about it. Well, there are things to do. There are, in the United States Congress... There is pending legislation on a very effective form of a \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d pretty much what is recommended by the International Energy Association. Programs which would, in fact put a limit on the threat, mitigate the crisis, lead us to creating a much better world with a sustainable environment and a much better life for all of us. It\u2019s within reach. It can be done within a few percentage of the Gross Domestic Product, far less than was used, say, during the World War. Actually, even less than was expended than the Treasury Department to bail out the financial institutions during the Covid epidemic. It\u2019s all within reach, but it has to be done, and it\u2019s not going to be done unless major efforts are made by people with the opportunity to convince others to engage in these commitments. So, there\u2019s a tremendous opportunity and a tremendous responsibility."

    "input": "JL:Thank you so much for your response to that question, Professor Chomsky. And, again, related to your essay \u201cThe Responsibility of Intellectuals\u201d... In the beginning of that essay, you referenced Dwight MacDonald who questioned the extent to which the German or Japanese people were responsible for the atrocities committed by their governments. Today, the U.S.-Taiwan-China relationship is strained, and dialogue between any two governments is difficult, but one can imagine that dialogues between people are bound by fewer constraints. To what extent, do you think, are regular people, those we don\u2019t normally think of as intellectuals, responsible for preventing conflict between their countries?",
    "output": "I should first comment on, briefly, on the responsibility of the Japanese and the Germans for their atrocities. They were defeated in the war, and defeated countries are forced, by force, to acknowledge some of their atrocities. In the case of the Japanese, it was very striking. The trials of the Japanese were run by the United States, and they made a very careful distinction among Japanese atrocities. They began with Pearl Harbor. They did not discuss the atrocities of the Japanese against Asians, which were enormous and extraordinary, by far the worst ones. They were cut out at the tribunal. That\u2019s the reason incidentally why Asian countries, almost all of them, refused to attend the San Francisco Peace Treaty. Because of the narrow way in which the United States construed Japanese crimes. One of the reasons they simply refused to attend. So, there was partial acknowledgement of responsibilities. In the case of Germany, more extensive. The United States and Britain didn\u2019t acknowledge their atrocities during the Second World War, which were very significant. The bombing of Japan, for example, was a major atrocity. The bombing of urban environments in Germany, a major atrocity. These were unacknowledged. In fact, the trials were set up... the Nuremberg Trials, the most serious one, was set up in such a way as to absolve the Allies of any responsibility. A German war criminal could plead in defense that the Allies had done the same thing, and that was recognized to be a defense because the crimes of the Allies, the victors, could not be considered. That was even more dramatically true in the Tokyo trials, which were victors\u2019 justice. So, partial acknowledgement. Well, coming to your question, we have an enormous responsibility today to prevent the kinds of conflicts that are coming, that are brewing, that are developing. And if permitted, the current course is pursued, will very likely lead to extremely dangerous situations, possibly even nuclear war. And a nuclear war between major powers is simply unthinkable. It would essentially destroy everything. It would leave the kind of world nobody would want to live in. How is it happening? Just take a look at what\u2019s happening right off the coast of China. Chinese warplanes have penetrated the air defense system of Taiwan. The United States has sent a huge naval armada, two major aircraft carrier groups into the South China Sea, an area of enormous strategic importance for China. Any of these things could blow up at any moment off the coast of China. Notice, it\u2019s not in the Caribbean Sea. It\u2019s not the Eastern Pacific, the Eastern Pacific off the coast of California. It\u2019s off the coast of China. China is ringed with nuclear bases, a circle of containment, nuclear missiles aimed at China from U.S. bases all through the Pacific. What\u2019s called \u201cThe Quad,\u201d the four major Asian U.S. allies, Japan... U.S., Japan, Australia, India, all in the hands of extremely right-wing, hawkish governments. They are now being organized by the United States to take a more active hostile view towards China. The United States itself is devoting enormous efforts to try to prevent China\u2019s development. It\u2019s pretty shocking to look at it. We should be cooperating. It is necessary for China and the United States, two major economies, to be cooperating on all sorts of issues, crucial issues like global warming, pandemics, nuclear weapons. Instead of cooperating on these, there\u2019s conflict, most of it initiated by the United States. Just to give an example of the extent to which it reaches: the United States Congress just passed a limited stimulus bill to reconstruct collapsing infrastructure, which badly needs repair in the United States. U.S. infrastructure is a scandal. You can take a high-speed train from Beijing to Kazakhstan, but you can\u2019t take it from Boston to Washington, New York to Washington, the most heavily traveled corridor, because the United States is so backward in infrastructure. Well, a limited bill was finally passed. It couldn\u2019t be an adequate bill because the Republican party blocked anything adequate, but it did pass, and the only way to pass it was to put it into a \u201cHate China\u201d framework. \u201cWe have to rebuild our infrastructure to make sure that China doesn\u2019t get ahead of us.\u201d It\u2019s outrageous. We have to rebuild our infrastructure because we need to rebuild it. If China happens to make contributions in solar power, in electrification, in health areas, whatever, we should be congratulating them and joining with them, not trying to impede it. Actually, this goes far back in American history, back to the 18th and 19th century. During the 19th century, when the imperial powers led by Britain were attacking China, forcing China... It was the largest narco-trafficking operation in world history to try to undermine China. The United States was participating in it during that period. Chinese workers were being kidnapped to work in the United States on work that Americans didn\u2019t want to do, like blasting through the mountain for the Transcontinental Railroad. \u201cChinese coolies,\u201d they were called, bitterly repressed. In 1882, the United States passed its first law against immigrants aimed at the Chinese. No Chinese could immigrate, and the Chinese who were in the United States were forcefully and rather brutally evicted. That remained... That law remained till quite recently. During the 1950s, there was another anti-China hysteria that developed. In fact, some of this was so extreme that Jack London, one of the most progressive writers about a century ago, wrote a story about how we have to kill everyone in China by bacteriological warfare to prevent them from conquering and destroying us. Well, comes up to today when there\u2019s another \u201cHate China\u201d campaign developing. China does a lot of wrong things. They should be criticized and condemned just as they should be condemning our wrong things done by the United States, but this is no reason to build up a monstrous \u201cHate China\u201d campaign, which will undermine... which is not only harming China, as it is intended to, but it\u2019s harming everyone cause it\u2019s building up the kinds of tensions that could seriously explode, and it\u2019s preventing the kind of cooperation \u2014 international cooperation \u2014 that is necessary if we\u2019re going to deal with our current crises. JL:Thank you so much. My next question is related to this so-called competition between the United States and China. In an interview last August with the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Hong Kong, you described China\u2019s actions in Asia as an attempt to reassert its traditional role as a regional power and how the United States will not allow it. You also described Hong Kong as the \u201ctrampled grass when elephants fight.\u201d So, my question is this: how should people in Taiwan and smaller countries in Asia navigate this Great Power conflict between the United States and China? And do you see any room for agency or self-determination for \u201cthe grass?\u201d It\u2019s a very tough situation for them. Hong Kong has been subjected to highly repressive Chinese actions the last couple of years, which should be resisted to the extent possible. They should be partially condemned. In the case of Taiwan... Taiwan has developed a very impressive functioning democracy with a very impressive economy. In fact, it has the leading semiconductor plant in the whole world! Just one example. There is a delicate situation with China. It has been maintained so far by formally accepting the \u201cOne-China Policy\u201d but, in fact, implementing separate and independent political and economic development. Well, for the Taiwanese, the increasing hostilities between the U.S. and China are a very severe threat, and they should be doing whatever they can to pressure the major powers towards diplomacy and negotiations and cutback of hostile actions. They can help in this regard. Same in Hong Kong. Hong Kong, of course, had a fair degree of independence, but we should bear in mind that that\u2019s recent. Hong Kong was stolen from China by British savagery as part of their effort to destroy China in their huge narco-trafficking operations. The West may like to forget that, but I\u2019m sure the Chinese don\u2019t. That\u2019s part of the background to remember. It doesn\u2019t justify what Chinese authorities are doing now, but it can help explain it. So, yes, the countries in the periphery of China have a degree of agency. A very difficult situation, hard to maneuver, but their efforts should be dedicated to the extent possible to pressing the great powers, the United States and China, U.S. allies in Asia, towards negotiation and diplomacy, which is certainly possible. There\u2019s plenty of room for it. The problems that exist are real. They can be mitigated, settled by proper peaceful means, and that\u2019s the only hope for decent survival, for the countries of Asia. Or, for that matter, the world."

    "output": "Well, Asia\u2019s in a remarkable situation. If you look back at world history, going back millenia up until the 18th century \u2014 that\u2019s almost all of recorded history, Asia was the center of global civilization. Europe was a fringe of barbarians, the outside of Asia. You remember very well, I\u2019m sure, that when the British emissaries came to China in the 18th century and were admitted by the emperor, allowed to visit him and try to arrange for trade agreements. He, the emperor, informed them, \u201cWe don\u2019t need anything from you. We have everything we need. We\u2019re far more advanced than you are. If you want, we\u2019ll let you set up a small trading post somewhere where you can follow our rules, but you have nothing to offer us.\u201d That was pretty much the case. Same is true for India. India was a rich developed society, far more so than England. The Europeans had one advantage: savagery. That\u2019s it. The Europeans were more advanced in the means of warfare. Military historians point out that Europe had turned war into a science None of the rest of the world had and, using their advantages in savagery, the Europeans were able to break into Asia, devastate India, deindustrialize India. England stole its higher technology, deindustrialized it, wrecked it, break into China through mainly violence. They had greater means of violence... the narco-trafficking operations... and Asia suffered a period in human history, a brief period of subjection to outside forces. It was very harmful. Well, it\u2019s beginning its recovery. It\u2019s recovering the status that it once had. It\u2019s becoming again a major center of civilization, of production, of culture and so on. Where\u2019s it going to go from here? That\u2019s in your hands. There\u2019s a lot of possibilities, but Asia could recover the kind of position it once had \u2014 not that it was a beautiful society, it wasn\u2019t in many ways. But in comparison with global conditions at the time, it was the most advanced, and it can move in that direction again. But that depends on how people in Asia, people like you, young people, will be able to take advantage of the opportunities that are available to you and overcome the very severe obstacles that lie in the way of doing so. It\u2019s a historic challenge. JL:Thank you so much for your time, Professor Chomsky, and for everything that you\u2019ve done. It was my pleasure speaking with you today. Thank you very much.

And I am not thinking so much about the increasing influence of transnational corporations on democratic processes as about decisions made by a handful of appointed or elected individuals that affect the lives of millions of people. For example, a few people sitting at the Supreme Court were appointed for life by presidents that lost the popular vote, and they often enough issue decisions that go against the majority of voters\u2019 preferences. Another example is members of the U.S. Congress who block bills aimed at the improvement of the economic well-being of citizens and the protection of the environment, choosing instead to introduce legislation catered to the interests of powerful lobby groups. Can you comment about this most despairing state of affairs in the U.S. political landscape?",
    "output": "The Supreme Court has traditionally been a reactionary institution. There is some deviation, but it\u2019s rare. The Warren Court\u2019s major decisions greatly enhanced freedom and basic rights, but not in isolation: There were popular movements, primarily African American but joined by others to a degree, which made it possible for the Warren Court\u2019s rulings to be implemented. Today\u2019s reactionary Roberts Court is reverting to the norm with its dedicated efforts to reverse this deviation. And it can do so thanks in large measure to the conniving and deceit of the leading anti-democratic figure in the Republican organization \u2014 no longer an authentic political party: Mitch McConnell. All of this is, or should be, well known. I\u2019ll return to a few comments about it. Less well known is how far back this goes. Some of the story is familiar, but not all. It\u2019s familiar that the enormous power of the Supreme Court traces back to Justice John Marshall\u2019s decision inMarbury v. Madisonto make the judiciary the arbiter of the meaning of the law, powers going well beyond what is granted in the Constitution. His appointment by John Adams, and his own immediate appointments and decisions, were designed to undercut the newly elected Jefferson administration. Shades of McConnell. Marshall\u2019s opinions had a major impact in shaping the constitutional order as it in fact is interpreted. His imprint on the court is unmatched. All of that is again well known. Much less well known are the assumptions that lie behind Marshall\u2019s major decisions. In fact, these have only recently been revealed in legal scholarship by the important work of Paul Finkelman, who did the first systematic study of Marshall\u2019s rulings on a central element of American history: slavery, which is likely to be expunged from history curricula if Republicans regain power and can implement their totalitarian initiatives to determine what cannot be taught in schools. Finkelman explores \u201cChief Justice John Marshall\u2019s personal and political commitment to slavery, as a lifelong buyer and seller of human beings, and his deep hostility to the presence of free blacks in America.\u201d He then proceeds to show that in his judicial rulings, Marshall \u201calways supported slaveowners when blacks claimed to be free. Similarly, he consistently failed to enforce the federal prohibitions on American participation in the African slave trade or, after 1808, the absolute prohibition on bringing new slaves into the United States.\u201d As Finkelman points out, Marshall\u2019s harsh and brutal rulings were \u201cconsistent with his lifelong personal and political support for slavery.\u201d Apart from the immediate impact on the lives of those treated as less than human in his day and throughout American history, Marshall was no ordinary justice. It is an understatement to say that he is \u201cperhaps the Supreme Court\u2019s most influential chief justice.\u201d This is not the place to review the long and often sordid history of the court. It\u2019s enough to remember that it hardly accords with the patriotic slogans we are enjoined to chant by the new totalitarians in Washington. As for Congress, the story is mixed. One constant feature is service to the rich and powerful, relying on means of the kind you mention. Popular activism has sometimes proved to be an effective counterforce, with major effects on civilizing the country. The New Deal period from the \u201830s through the \u201860s is the most recent case. Though the business classes worked hard to whittle New Deal measures away, they retained strong political support, including from the last authentic conservative president, Dwight Eisenhower. In his view, \u201cShould any political party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment in\u00adsurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that par\u00adty again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things. . . . [But] their number is negligible and they are stupid.\u201d Eisenhower\u2019s attitudes illustrate how far his party has declined in recent years, meanwhile defaming the term \u201cconservatism.\u201d One current illustration of the drift of the party to the far right is its love affair with the racist \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d of Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary. It is not confined to Tucker Carlson and the like but goes far beyond. As one illustration, the American Conservative Union \u201cconvenes in Budapest next month [June] to celebrate a European leader accused of undermining democracy and individual rights.\u201d Justly accused, but Orb\u00e1n regards it as praise, not accusation, and today\u2019s \u201cconservatives\u201d appear to agree. Eisenhower\u2019s prognosis was wrong. The \u201csplinter group\u201d \u2014 which unfortunately was far from that \u2014 was not merely waiting in the wings. It was gnawing away at measures to benefit the public, often effectively. By the late Carter years, its influence was strongly felt. The Democrats had by then pretty much abandoned any authentic concern with working people, becoming increasingly a party of affluent professionals. Reagan opened the doors wide to those whom Eisenhower had bitterly condemned, launching the powerful neoliberal assault on the general population of the past 40 years, which is still vigorously underway. This is not the place to review its impact once again. It is encapsulated in the Rand Corporation study that we have discussed, which found that these programs have \u201ctransferred\u201d close to $50 trillion from the middle and working classes to the ultrarich in 40 years, a pretty impressive feat of highway robbery. Today\u2019s Republican organization can barely control its enthusiasm at the prospect of carrying the assault further, concealed with cynical populist slogans. All of this is transpiring before our eyes, quite openly. The congressional GOP virtually goose-steps in obedience to McConnell\u2019s explicit and public orders, reprised from the Obama years. There is one and only one legislative priority: regain power. That means ensuring that the country is ungovernable, and that any legislation that might benefit the general population must be blocked. Then failure to achieve anything can be blamed on Democrats \u2014 a few of whom participate in the sham. The most striking current example is the Build Back Better program, a quite respectable initiative that would have greatly helped the population when it left Bernie Sanders\u2019s desk. Whittled away step-by-step under the McConnell principle, now not even shreds remain. Meanwhile the GOP leadership established their red lines: (1) defund the IRS, so that it cannot interfere with the massive tax cheating by the prime GOP constituency, the very rich; (2) don\u2019t touch the one legislative achievement of the Trump years, what Joseph Stiglitz called \u201cthe donor relief bill of 2017,\u201d a massive giveaway to the very rich and corporate sector, stabbing everyone else in the back. This giveaway to the rich also hurt the right\u2019s own voters, whom the GOP has labored to keep in line since Nixon by diverting attention from its actual programs to \u201ccultural issues\u201d that appeal to Christian nationalists, white supremacists, Evangelicals, avid gun lovers, and segments of the working class devastated by neoliberal programs and long abandoned by the Democrats. The court has played its role in reviving the ugliest elements of the history we are instructed to suppress. Probably the most egregious decision of the Roberts Court was to dismantle the Voting Rights Act on ridiculous grounds (Shelby), offering the South the means to restore Jim Crow.Citizens Unitedextended the Buckley doctrine that money is speech \u2014 very convenient for the very rich particularly \u2014 to giving virtually free rein to those sectors in a position to buy elections. Next on the chopping block isRoe v. Wade. The effects will be extreme. A right regarded by most women, and others, as solidly established is to be wiped out. That\u2019s almost unprecedented. Undermining of the right of Black people to vote by theShelbydecision is a partial precedent. Justice Alito\u2019s leaked draft is based primarily on the principle that court decisions should give primacy to what is \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d And he is quite right that women\u2019s rights do not satisfy this condition. The founders adopted British common law, which held that a woman is property, owned by her father, ownership transferred to her husband. One early argument for denying the vote to women was that it would be unfair to unmarried men, since a married man would have two votes, his own and his \u201cproperty\u2019s.\u201d (The infamous three-fifth\u2019s human provision granted that right to slaveowners.) It wasn\u2019t until 1975 that the Supreme Court granted full personhood to women, granting them the right to serve on federal juries as \u201cpeers.\u201d This ultra-reactionary judicial doctrine is, like others, quite flexible. One illustration is Antonin Scalia\u2019sHellerdecision, which reversed a century of precedent and established personal gun ownership as Holy Writ. In his very learned opinion, Scalia succeeded in ignoring all of the rich \u201chistory and tradition\u201d that lies behind the decree that \u201cA well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d The history and tradition are hardly a secret, from the founders through the 19th century, though of course they have no relevance to American history since: (1) the Brits are coming; (2) militias are needed to attack, expel and exterminate the Indigenous nations once the British constraint on expansion was removed, arguably the primary reason for the revolution \u2014 though later they were displaced by a more efficient killing machine, the U.S. Cavalry; (3) slaves had to be controlled by force, a threat that was becoming severe with slave revolts in the Caribbean and the South; (4) before the constitutional system was firmly established, there was concern that the British model might be imposed (as Alexander Hamilton had suggested) and might lead to a tyranny that would have to be resisted by popular forces. None of this \u201chistory and tradition\u201d had any relevance by the 20th century, at least in semi-rational circles. But it was surely there in history and tradition, not justtherebut a central part of the history that is scheduled for cancellation as the GOP marches downwards. All of this proceeds with the help of the reactionary judiciary that has been constructed carefully by McConnell and allies, with the goal of imposing a barrier to anything like the deviation of Eisenhower for a long time. Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice and a specialist on the Second Amendment, observes that since Scalia reversed long-standing precedent by ignoring history and tradition, the court has had little to say about the gun issue, much to the discomfiture of the extreme right on the court. But that, Waldman suggests, may be about to change. The court is considering a case that might overturn a 1913 New York law that restricts carrying a concealed weapon in public places. From Alito\u2019s comments in oral argument, and Thomas\u2019s well-known positions, Waldman suspects that the 1913 ruling may be overturned. We\u2019ll then enjoy a world in which concealed weapons are everywhere. It\u2019s worth remembering that today\u2019s frenzied gun culture is largely the creation of the public relations industry, in fact one of its first great triumphs, a revealing history explored in depth by Pamela Haag inThe Gunning of America: Business and the Making of American Gun Culture. Guns were indeed used for definite purposes, those just described. And individual farmers could use an old musket to scare away critters attacking cattle. For them a gun was a tool, like a shovel. Arms manufacturers were meanwhile developing advanced weapons, but for armies, not the public, which had little interest in them. By the late 19th century, a problem was arising. After the Civil War, the domestic market largely collapsed for advanced armaments. Peace in Europe undermined another market. The U.S. army was not engaged in major wars. The nascent PR industry was enlisted to the cause. It concocted an exciting image of a Wild West that never existed, with brave cowboys and sheriffs fast on the draw, and the rest of the familiar fantasies, later exploited by Hollywood and TV. The subtext was that your son is dying to have a Winchester rifle so that he can be a real man, and his sister must have a little pink pistol. It worked, brilliantly, as many of us can attest from childhood memories, if not beyond. The mythology was later expanded as part of the awesome GOP propaganda campaign to divert attention away from their actual policies and commitments. Scalia\u2019s radical departure from \u201chistory and tradition\u201d then turned the Second Amendment into the only part of the Constitution that is worshipped fervently, that is even known by much of the population."

These, in turn, are largely structured by the reigning institutions, which are in substantial measure in the hands of the \u201cmasters of mankind.\u201d For example, today the options are \u201cget a job or starve,\u201d so getting a job is perceived to be one of the highest goals in life. In the early days of the industrial revolution, Americans regarded \u201cgetting a job\u201d as an intolerable attack on human rights and dignity. They understood that it meant subordinating yourself to a master for most of your waking hours. And they had alternatives in mind. The slogan of the Knights of Labor, the first great labor organization, was that \u201cthose who work in the mills should own them.\u201d Anything less than that was intolerable. Meanwhile farmers in what was then mostly an agrarian country sought to create a \u201ccooperative commonwealth\u201d in which farmers would work together, free from the northern bankers and market managers. That\u2019s the authentic populist movement, which began to establish contacts with the Knights. Their efforts were crushed by state and private violence, another defeat of radical democracy. And \u201cwhat people want\u201d then changed, as the options they could envision reduced. The task of organizers and activists is first of all to break the fetters of ideological control and to help people understand that there are ways of looking at the world that are different from those constructed by the masters and their ideological institutions. That will enable changes in what people want. Then come the crucial questions of what should be changed, and how."

Likewise, he looked to Israel and Lebanon\u2019s recent agreement to share offshore gas fields in the Mediterranean \u2014 despite the fact that both countries are severely threatened by rising sea levels caused by fossil fuel emissions. In his 2003 bestseller Hegemony or Survival, Chomsky dealt with similar issues at length.

We can use these in a way which is appropriate to situations and constantly in new ways, often which of are new in the history of the language in our own history. Well, this creative character through the centuries has been connected speculatively, but not absurdly, to a fundamental instinct for freedom, which is part of our essential nature, resistance to domination and control by illegitimate authorities, fundamental element of human nature, maybe part of the same creative capacity, which shows up very strikingly in our normal use of language."

If we want freedom and we want creativity, why do we often gravitate towards things that feel like they take those away from us?",
    "output": "NOAM CHOMSKY: Well a lot of it is beaten out of us from childhood. Take a look at children, constantly asking why they want explanations, they want to understand things. You go to school, your regimented. You\u2019re taught this is the way you\u2019re supposed to behave, not other ways. The institutions of the society are constructed, so as to reduce, modify, limit the efforts and control of one\u2019s own destiny. Take something as simple as having a job, we consider that now the highest goal in life. High school student asks your advice, you say, he better be prepared to get a job. For about 2,000 years from the Romans into the late 19th century, the idea of having a job was considered an abomination. You\u2019re placing yourself in a position of subordination to a master. The fundamental attack on human dignity, on human rights. No person with any integrity and self-respect should submit themselves to this. These are old issues. [INAUDIBLE] David Hume, my favorite philosopher, wrote one of, maybe the first, modern tract than what we now call political science, foundations of government. He opened in the first paragraph by posing a kind of a paradox. He said, he is surprised by the easiness with which men subordinate themselves to government and the other powers. This is since power is in the hands of the governed, the general population, why do they submit themselves to power and authority? And he says, the only answer for this, he says, is enforced consent. Society is structured so that people will consent to what is in opposition to their fundamental nature, subordinate themselves to others. Later, this was Antonio Gramsci, in his Mussolini\u2019s prison cells, developed the same conception in much detail talking about how, what he called, hegemonic common sense is imposed in opposition to people\u2019s needs and right. EZRA KLEIN: Let me ask you about what makes you confident that these wants are beaten out of people as opposed to that their competing wants to get satisfied and often obscure other parts of our nature. And I\u2019ll give an example here. I have a two-year-old son. It\u2019s a wonderful age. And part of what he wants to do is create and learn. I mean, I get asked the question, \u201cWhat that?,\u201d 400 times a day, at least. But also, we\u2019ve made the mistake of letting him see cartoons, once or twice. And every morning is a fight to not put on the TV. Like, he screams. And he\u2019s mad. I have friends who have older kids. They want those kids to go build things. And they want to send them to like enriching summer camps. And they want them to read books. And the kids want to play video games. And it\u2019s always a fight. And I do think your politics leads in a different direction. If what you think is that the sort of capitalist structure is making people want things they don\u2019t really want and suppressing their true wants versus if you think, and I probably lean more towards this, that there are a lot of things we want. And one of the hard things about building a politics focused on human enrichment of the kind that you describe here is that a lot of companies are able to give us consumer electronics and other kinds of entertainments that unfortunately are things people really do want and really do embrace. And it\u2019s hard to get folks to put those to the side and participate in more classical form of politics in small d, democracy you\u2019re talking about. NOAM CHOMSKY: What you\u2019re saying is life is complicated. EZRA KLEIN: [LAUGHS] There. NOAM CHOMSKY: The relation between you and your children, that is a relation of authority and domination. And it has some justification. That\u2019s not a legitimate authority. It can be used illegitimately, but it is \u2014 the core of it, yes, there\u2019s a relation of domination, which has its justification for survival. It can be used in such a way as to encourage independence, creativity, or it can be used in a way to impose authority and control. The child will pick away within these conflicting influences. However, when you move to the structure of society, say, the creation of wants by corporate power, there\u2019s no legitimacy to that relation of authority. That\u2019s a relation of central power. I think we have a huge industry in the United States \u2014 public relations industry, advertising industry. We know what it\u2019s for. Its founders told us. The founders of the industry, like Edward Bernays in the 1920s, when the industry was developing, one of the main leaders, wrote a major book on this called \u201cPropaganda.\u201d In those days propaganda didn\u2019t have the negative connotations that it has today. It just meant persuasion. He discusses there what he calls engineering of consent. This is our task as responsible men is to engineer junior the consent of the masses. He did it for example by a major project which succeeded in getting women to smoke. Models walking down 5th Avenue holding cigarettes, saying, this is the way to be a modern woman and so on. And he did succeed in getting women to smoke. It\u2019s one of the first major successes in engineering consent. We can count up the number of corpses that led to it. At the same time that he was writing, the leading public intellectual of the 20th century Walter Lippmann was writing on what he called manufacture of consent, which he described as a new art in the practice of democracy. It\u2019s a way to ensure, as he put it, that the bewildered herd, the general population, will be controlled. That we, the responsible men, will not be subjected to the trampling on the roar of the bewildered herd. Now, their task is to be spectators, not participants. EZRA KLEIN: Let me try to hold two pieces of this together because one of the things, I think, is interesting here is\u2014 I agree with you pretty fundamentally, and we\u2019re here at the show has advertising on it. My paper has advertising in it. If you go back to mid century American economics and critiques of capitalism, there\u2019s much more of a sense of advertising as a shaping force. I still like John Kenneth Galbraith\u2019s The Affluent Society a lot, in part for these reasons. I mean, I think it understands something that we\u2019ve lost, which is that the wants that arise within capitalism are not just natural. The part of this had push on a little bit is they\u2019re also not just manufactured. I mean, I\u2019ve started publications. I\u2019ve worked a lot with advertisers who were advertising. They don\u2019t have that much control. They try a lot of things. Some of them work, some of them don\u2019t. If you get people hooked on cigarettes, the advertising helps. But the nicotine is really doing a lot of work for you. But there are tons of movies that have gigantic advertising budgets and they flop. There are tons of political projects and political candidates. Like, in my State of California, Meg Whitman spent about $150 million of her own money to lose by more than 10 percentage points. I mean, Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign spent about the same amount only to see him drop out early in the primary. So there is a relationship here where the public has some power, too. And what ends up happening, it always seems to me is sort of in the Venn diagram of what power wants and what there\u2019s money to try to get people to want, but also what the public wants. And a lot of that stuff is not great, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as much a capacity for mind control, as some of the more totalizing versions of this theory hold. NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, I agree with that. These are efforts. Efforts don\u2019t have to succeed. But what we\u2019re talking about is the massive extraordinary effort that goes into creating wants, shaping opinion, ensuring that doctrines are not questioned. A separate question is whether it works. Well, that\u2019s a mixed story. Sometimes, it does. Sometimes, it doesn\u2019t. But underlying it is the fact that one of the major factors components of our social order is a huge attempt to manufacture consent to create wants, to ensure doctrinal conformity. And it often does work. Cigarettes is a case where it worked. In fact, it\u2019s very interesting to look at these cases. Take cigarettes, again, I\u2019m sure you remember the Marlboro man, where does that come from? Well, that actually comes from the creation of the gun culture. In the 19th century, it was an agricultural country. Farmers had guns and chased the critters away. There was a huge gun manufacturing industry \u2014 fancy Winchester, Remington, Colt, and so on. They had a big market during the Civil War. Well, Civil War was over, the market collapsed. There were wars going on all over Europe. They bought fancy guns from the American manufacturers. By the late 19th century, that had stopped. Europe had moved into a temporarily peaceful period. The gun manufacturers were in trouble. They didn\u2019t have a market. Farmers didn\u2019t want their fancy stuff. What were they going to do? What they did first was concoct a fabricated image of the Wild West \u2014 sheriffs fast on the draw and noble cowboys, all this kind of stuff. Bottom line of this is you better get your son a Winchester rifle or he won\u2019t be a real man. And you better get your daughter a little pink pistol or she won\u2019t be a proper woman and so on. That was essentially the thrust of the advertising campaign. It had an enormous effect. We\u2019re living with it right now. The whole story from the beginning is fabrication. I mean, you go back to the actual 19th century, cowboys were not the lone ranger running around to save people. It was a guy who couldn\u2019t get a job, so maybe someone would hire him to push cows around or something like that. But we live with these stories."

Most of them are what David Hume, Edward Bernays, Walter Lippmann, Adam Smith, and others have been talking about over the centuries. Namely, illegitimate authority. Well, illegitimate authorities should be exposed, challenged, overcome. That\u2019s true in all of life. We\u2019ve talked about a few cases. Like, say, the workplace, where it\u2019s illegitimate, should not be tolerated, wasn\u2019t tolerated, until it was driven out of people\u2019s heads by force and violence.

In some of the more classic theories of democracy, if you have the consent of the governed and the exercise of authority on their behalf is legitimate. I think there are many of those cases that you wouldn\u2019t agree with. So under anarchism, how are those decisions made?",
    "output": "NOAM CHOMSKY: Here, we go back to the first question you raised, about the unique human properties, like the capacity for thought. You have to think it through. There\u2019s no algorithm. Life is too complicated for simple algorithms. You take a look at the situation, think it through, deliberate it with others in a free society, where people have access to information, have gained control of their lives. They think it through and decide. Take the case of subordinating yourself to a master for most of your waking life. Well, workingmen, in the 19th century, young women from the farms, factory girls that were called. They did think it through. And we can see what their thinking was by reading the very eloquent and forceful literature that they created. They bitterly attacked the imposition of what they called monarchic rule in the workplace, where their basic rights were taken away by subordination to a master, which they regarded as not fundamentally different from slavery, except that it was maybe temporary, you could get free of it. The working people held that we should move towards, what they called, a cooperative Commonwealth, where people control their own lives. Workers should control the enterprises in which they work. Their conception was that anyone who appropriates the labor of someone else is in a position of illegitimate authority. And out of that came the whole picture. Well, that\u2019s how you answer the questions, by deliberation among people who are putting their minds to work. Can you assure the right answer will come out? Of course, not. EZRA KLEIN: But people do come to very different answers with this. I mean, you talk about anarchism is the libertarian wing of socialism. And then I know people who end up being the libertarian wing of capitalism and end up very much on the other side. And they\u2019re smart folks, too. And one of the critiques you\u2019ll hear is that you need a certain amount of hierarchy and organization, which I think in many cases, you would call domination, for complex economic levels of structure."

And not everybody can be equal in that decision-making. Somebody needs to run the organization. Somebody needs to run the lab. And that\u2019s difficult if you\u2019re sort of doing every decision sort of from scratch in real time. How do you think about that trade-off between complexity and deliberation?",
    "output": "NOAM CHOMSKY: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a trade-off if it\u2019s done in a free democratic society. A free society can select people to have administrative and other authority to take over parts of the concern for the common good. And they can be recalled. But they\u2019re under popular control. They\u2019re not there because their grandfather built railroads or because in some, they managed to finesse the market so that they ended up with a ton of money. They\u2019re not there for that reason. They\u2019re there because they\u2019re delegated under popular authority, [INAUDIBLE], not of any amount of structure of hierarchy and domination you want. You have this in, for example, a worker controlled enterprises. Some of them huge. Take, say, Mondragon, the largest of them, been around for about 60 years in Northern Spain, worker-owned, worker-managed, huge conglomerate, industrial production, banks, housing, hospitals, everything. It\u2019s not perfect by any means, but it does have \u2014 it\u2019s based on the fundamental principle of popular democratic control and authorization to carry out managerial functions when needed. And it actually have that in just about any decently functioning research lab in a university, works pretty much the same way. Maybe a department chair was chosen to handle the administrative work, if faculty doesn\u2019t like him, you pick somebody else. These are certainly possible structures of all kinds. They don\u2019t undermine the possibility of organization. In fact, anarchist society should be highly organized, but under popular control of a free informed community, which can interact without illegitimate forces controlling them."

    "output": "EZRA KLEIN: Not really. NOAM CHOMSKY: And for very good reasons, and we can discuss it. But if you had a real representative democracy, then it would be very much like this. The community would select people to carry out this test because they\u2019re good at it or maybe they want it, and others don\u2019t, others want something else. But it would be under popular supervision, recall, if necessary, and constant interaction. So I think there should be participation at all points. Now, take your own example, distributing a vaccine. Well, people should have to have some say in this. How do we want it to be done? If somebody refuses to accept the vaccine, what should we do about it? Well, that\u2019s a live problem right now. Almost half of Republicans are going to refuse to accept the vaccine. What that says is we\u2019ll never get out of the Covid crisis because we\u2019ll never get a level of immunity, which will make it kind of like flu, maybe you take a shot every year. But it\u2019s not lethal. We\u2019ll never get to that. Or suppose some individual says, I\u2019m not going to wear a mask, what do we do about it? Well, those are problems that the community has to decide. Suppose somebody says, I\u2019m not going to obey traffic laws, I don\u2019t like them. I\u2019m going to run through red lights and drive on the left side of the road. I want to be free. Well, I have to make decisions about that. Saying, I\u2019m not going to wear a mask is not very different from that. Says, I\u2019m going to go out to the shopping mall, and if I infect you, it\u2019s your problem. Well, communities are going to have to make decisions about things like this. EZRA KLEIN: I agree, but it feels to me like you\u2019ve reinvented the system in many ways that we have. I mean, I agree that we don\u2019t have a strongly representative democracy, and I might have different reasons I believe that than you do, although we share quite a few. But this is very much my question about who decides on legitimacy. If we\u2019re back in a system where some people say, well, you got to wear masks and be doing a business lockdown, and other people say, no, that\u2019s an unfair imposition of dominance over me, then it sounds to me like we\u2019re sort of talking about more marginal changes to what we have now, than certainly, the word anarchism sounds like."

The groups of farmers would get together, work out ways to run their own cooperative control over marketing and development. People in the service industry should do the same thing. That\u2019s how we should move towards popular control of institutions. That would be a totally different world than the one we live in. It\u2019s not marginal.

    "input": "EZRA KLEIN: So in a lot of classical economics, the idea is everything is built or much of our economy anyway is built on the freedom to contract. And if people freely chose to sign their name to something, then who are we in the government? Or who are we in society to say anything about it? You use a concept that\u2019s been around and critiques of capitalism for a long time, but you don\u2019t hear it that often in the mainstream, which is wage slavery, arguing that these are not actually free choices. Can you talk a bit about the idea of wage slavery and where you differ from those who think our economy is built on the freedom to contract?",
    "output": "NOAM CHOMSKY: Freedom of contract is a joke. Those who enter into the free contract have radically different power relations. One of them is saying, I own this place, you can rent yourself to me if I\u2019m willing to accept you. The other thing, I got a choice between renting myself, the subordination to power, or starving. Now, that\u2019s freedom of contract. No, I\u2019m exaggerating. It\u2019s not entirely like that. There are lots of nuances. But that\u2019s it fundamentally. Let me just describe to you an anecdote, if you don\u2019t mind. When I was a college student, many years ago, I heard a lecture by the leading guru of what\u2019s called Libertarianism in the United States, which is radically different from the Libertarian tradition. This is Ludwig von Mises was giving a lecture on why the government causes unemployment. So the problem of unemployment is entirely the fault of the government. The government is imposing things like minimum wages, conditions in the workplace, all sorts of things, and that imposes unemployment. Because if we had real freedom, real freedom of contract without government interference, if some guy is starving and he could get a job for $0.10 an hour under horrible conditions, he\u2019d picked the job. But the government won\u2019t let them. So the government is causing unemployment. And that was my introduction to what\u2019s called right-wing libertarian thought by the top master. And in fact, that\u2019s the basic view. If you read the leading theorists \u2014 James Buchanan, one of the major thinkers in what\u2019s called Libertarianism here. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right word. He says, quite possibly that an economic system should be constructed so as to conform to human nature. That makes sense. And what\u2019s human nature? He tells us. This is every person\u2019s highest ideal is to be the master of a world of slaves. That\u2019s our highest ideal, in case you didn\u2019t notice it. And therefore, we have to design a society so everyone is free to pursue this fundamental human nature as fully as possible. Well, it\u2019s a certain conception. It\u2019s not mine. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s yours. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anybody\u2019s frankly, unless you\u2019re caught up in this ideology. But yes, that\u2019s a point of view. And it should be deliberated along with a point of view of the workers and farmers of 19th century America, who I think are much more representative of what\u2019s natural to humans."

I think the stronger arguing people make for different forms of capitalism or mixed economies in the way we have them now is it the same incentives that in many cases do lead to exploitation and do lead to inequality also drive technological and organizational innovation. And from generation to generation, it\u2019s those technological innovations, those organizational innovations that really change living standards. And it\u2019s not the government doesn\u2019t have a role, but that role is more basic. They fund basic research. And then the market drives that it forward. And that it\u2019s a trade-off worth making because we\u2019re supercharging human beings drive to status and drive to attain and harnessing it to create the technology that moves our species forward. How do you think about that?",
    "output": "NOAM CHOMSKY: I think it\u2019s just false. I mean, I spent my life in the main research institution in the world, MIT and research labs. You just go into a research lab. People aren\u2019t working, maybe people are working 80 hours a week. But it\u2019s not to make money. They can make a lot more money elsewhere. It\u2019s because of the excitement of the work. The challenge of solving problems. That\u2019s what drives people. It has no relation to the incentive to gain power. Yes, both are incentives, but they\u2019re totally different. And I think if you look at your children, you mentioned this constant why, why, why \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s what people want. They want to understand the world. They see problems, the problem can be, let\u2019s say, finding how the Covid virus works. That drives people to work hard because they want to understand it. They may not make any money out of it. And most of them, never do. I mean, we have a distorted system, which encourages them to try to make money out of it, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s driving it in the lab. Or it can be terrible mechanical things. I can\u2019t get anything to work. So my car isn\u2019t working. I take it to a mechanic. He see something\u2019s wrong, sees a problem, wants to solve the problem, takes skill, takes kind of intelligence I don\u2019t have. But just the interest in solving the problem drives it. Of course, he gets paid, but that\u2019s part of the structure of the outside system. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the driving force. You look at the development of technology, that\u2019s the way it happened. Take, say, the internet. It was actually going on in the labs where it was. And people were really interested in the problem of working out modes of interconnection at first among scientists and more broadly. Most of them are unknown and didn\u2019t make any money out of it. Same with the development of computers, same with almost all technological development, even to the famous levels. And take, say, Einstein working in the patent office in Switzerland, thinking about what would you observe if you were traveling at the speed of light. He wasn\u2019t doing it to make money. That\u2019s the way everything from your children up to advanced research works. That\u2019s where technological development and scientific development takes place. Now, actually, this is distorted by social structures. So in the early \u201980s, government laws were changed so that universities could get patents and researchers could get patents on the work that they were doing. OK. That had a cheapening effect. It meant that you really were imposing a structure in which people were working in order to make money, not to solve problems. And I think I don\u2019t know how to measure exactly, but my impression is it had a cheapening effect on the nature of the university system. When you impose these external constraints, that, say, you should be like, what, James Buchanan says you are, a person who\u2019s highest ideal is to be a master of slaves, well, you impose those outside structures, it does affect things."

They wanted to see a society with, to quote Mill, in which the natural form of organization is free association among participants. That\u2019s the way the industrial system should move according to Mill. That\u2019s what they should do in Denmark. Instead of having a master-slave relation, master-serf relation, if you want to call it that. Or it should have a relation of direct participation and control. Now, maybe, the Danish don\u2019t want that. Up to them, I\u2019m not their master. But I would like this option to be brought forth and liberated, discussed, developed. I think they probably would want it, just as free working people in the early days of the Industrial Revolution wanted. It\u2019s just their nature. And let me say, again, this is a conception that goes back literally 2,000 years. There\u2019s a qualification I should add. Those who are calling for freedom from dependence and that being the most abominable situation that exists. They were living in slave societies. So there was a category of people whose proper status was to be slaves. They were also living in patriarchal societies with the proper status of women was to be servants. So the talk about freedom is not without a good deal of hypocrisy. [MUSIC PLAYING]"

People do accept it because they don\u2019t think about alternatives. If alternatives are proposed, a lot of people can accept them pretty quickly. I think we\u2019ve seen many cases of this, not total overthrow of the system, but substantial changes. Take my own lifetime, there have been major changes. When I was a kid, early \u201930s, I was born in 1928, the depression, the working class has been totally crushed. 1920s, Wilsonian repression, other violence that essentially destroyed the labor movement, it was a Gilded Age, much like today, radical inequality, deep suffering much worse than today. That was the early \u201930s. Couple of years later, it was a very different country. We\u2019re still poor. My family was most first generation immigrant, mostly working-class, mostly unemployed. But by the mid \u201930s, the labor movement had reconstituted from ashes literally. We had militant labor action, CIO formation. It was leading up to the point of sit-down strikes, which are barely a step before saying, we don\u2019t need you bosses, we can run this place ourselves, right up to that. Then you started getting sharp changes, significant ones. Supreme Court stopped blocking New Deal efforts. You got the things that are a lot of the basis for our alliance today, ranging from Social Security to the T.V.A. and lot of things in between."

    "output": "NOAM CHOMSKY: It\u2019s a split story. On domestic policy, it\u2019s doing better than I expected frankly. In fact, as Erik Loomis points out, Biden is the first president, probably since F.D.R., to take a strong stand in favor of unionization. Biden has people in his Council of Economic Advisors who are heterodox economists, broken out of the framework of the stirringly neoliberal doctrines. The program for Build Back America is a very good program, of course. In fact, the stimulus, that was just passed. It had many good parts to it. This didn\u2019t happen as a miracle. It didn\u2019t happen because Biden had a religious conversion. He\u2019s been a conservative Democrat, a Clintonite Democrat all his life. What happened is very substantial popular pressure. That\u2019s where change takes place. There\u2019s lots of popular activism that\u2019s been pressing him and pressing him on every issue, including the most important issue there is destruction of the environment. If we don\u2019t take control of environmental destruction in the next decade or two, we\u2019re finished. It\u2019s that simple. We\u2019re going to reach a tipping point from which there\u2019s no return. We\u2019re facing major catastrophe unless we take action now. It\u2019s known what to do. It\u2019s feasible within reach. It has to be done. Well, Biden\u2019s climate program far from perfect, needs major changes, but it\u2019s far better than any predecessor. And the reason is because of popular activism. It\u2019s because of groups like Sunrise Movement, young people who occupy congressional offices. Out of that came something pretty dramatic, some form of Green New Deal, which is absolutely essential for survival \u2014 we\u2019re not going to survive any other way \u2014 moved from an object of ridicule way off in the margin, right to the legislative agenda. Nowhere near enough, but a long step forward. Well, that\u2019s the way changes take place. EZRA KLEIN: I do want to ask you something about the shape of what\u2019s leading to some of even the good things in the Biden administration, which is it\u2019s a strange moment for, I think, theories of class politics for the Democratic Party has become more dominated by upper income, more educated suburbanites, but it\u2019s also moving left on economics at the same time. I think the classic understanding of this is it would be class-based, that as you go up the income scale, you become more economically conservative and probably conservative. And more recently, that\u2019s not been true. Particularly issues of race and other questions of identity are very powerful players here."

And it found that, if you look at college-educated whites and noncollege whites, the same number roughly support a $15 minimum wage, government health insurance about the same thing, it\u2019s very, very similar. And in some areas, you\u2019ve begun to see more liberal or even more left positions among college educated folks. And I wonder if that\u2019s not forcing a different approach to a political coalition building. Do you think there is a different coalition that will get you to a more left outcome that has been true in the past? And if so, why?",
    "output": "NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, first of all, we should bear in mind that every example you gave illustrates how far to the right things have shifted. So take a minimum wage. Who\u2019s calling for a $30 an hour minimum wage? Well, if we had continued what was happening in the \u201950s and the \u201960s into the \u201970s before the neoliberal assault began, with that trajectory, if continued, which is not utopian, we\u2019d have probably about a $30 an hour minimum wage. Expectations have been so lowered by the business from neoliberal assault that we don\u2019t even dream of that. Take health care. It\u2019s pretty astonishing debate in the United States. Take Sanders\u2019s program, universal health care. Take the most liberal critical commentators, say, in The New York Times. They say it\u2019s a great idea, it\u2019s too radical for the American people. We can now move slowly. Why\u2019s it too radical for the American people? Mexico has it. Germany has it. England has it. Canada has it. It\u2019s almost everywhere. Why is it too radical for the American people? I mean, I think these are all examples of the extraordinary power of manufacture of consent, obvious things have been driven out of people\u2019s minds, not very far. I think they can come right back. But what kind of coalition do we have? Well, my own very conservative feeling is it\u2019s going to be labor-based. That\u2019s been the cutting edge of social progress as far back as we want to go in modern times. And I think it will continue to be. Now, the labor force is different than it was in the 1930s, service industries, high-tech all over the place. But I don\u2019t think it fundamentally changes things. You can have a popular organization of working people everywhere. And it should be in solidarity. That\u2019s very critical. You look at the names of the unions, a lot of them have the word \u201cInternational\u201d in their name. That should be made much more than a formalism. All of the problems we face today are international. The pandemic is international. We\u2019re, in fact, committing suicide right now in the rich countries with eyes open knowing we\u2019re doing it by monopolizing vaccines. We don\u2019t give vaccine, spread vaccines to Africa, poor countries in Asia, it\u2019s going to come back and hit us like a sledgehammer. Everybody knows it, but we still monopolize them. Take healing of the environment. That doesn\u2019t have any borders. We\u2019re going to have to not only eliminate at home any use of fossil fuels. It has to be eliminated within a couple of decades. But we have to make sure that it happens abroad."

    "input": "EZRA KLEIN: How about some of the more far-reaching technological solutions people want to try? So there\u2019s things like solar geoengineering, where you\u2019re blasting particles into the sky to make the atmosphere more reflective. It\u2019s not clear that we have ways to do this with ocean acidification, but certainly people are trying to come up with that. There\u2019s one argument that the way out is not going to be so much for political change, it\u2019s going to be through exerting more aggressive technological manipulation of the environment in a intended way than we have been so far. Where do you come down on that?",
    "output": "NOAM CHOMSKY: Now, first of all, let me make it clear that what I think doesn\u2019t really matter that much. EZRA KLEIN: Sure. But I\u2019m interested. NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, for good reasons, this requires technical expertise. I mean, I can read the physics journals, but I don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re saying. But I don\u2019t have the expertise to answer the question. However, you can find answers. Well, there are places where this is discussed in great detail. Maybe the most important general journal on this topic is The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. Go back maybe a year or so, there\u2019s a long article by Oxford professor of physics Raymond Pierrehumbert, one of the leading figures in the IPCC report, who discusses exactly this. He runs through the alternative technologies that are proposed and looks at their upside and downside. You read it, you can get an expert opinion, not my opinion. What he says basically is that a lot is unknown, he says. It\u2019s part of a shot in the dark. But he says one thing\u2019s pretty clear. If you put aerosol particles into the air to cut back sunlight, it\u2019s permanent. You can\u2019t withdraw them. You withdraw them, you have a catastrophe. That means we\u2019re instituting a permanent change in the whole ecology. And any modification of it would be catastrophic. That\u2019s a tremendous burden to put on future generations. The other point about this is simply one of time scale. We have a couple of decades to answer these questions. These developments, even if they\u2019re feasible, even if they\u2019re the right thing to do, putting all doubt aside, it\u2019s not going to happen in a relevant time scale. Actually, that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s wrong with the Biden program. Part of the Biden program and sort of deference to the fuel company and fossil fuel companies is to put a lot of emphasis into high technology possible potential changes of engineering type. That\u2019s not relevant to the climate crisis. Even if it\u2019s feasible, it\u2019s just the wrong time scale. That\u2019s kind of like people who say on the left, we\u2019re not going to solve the climate crisis until we get rid of capitalism. That\u2019s capitalism inherently is self-destructive. Well, there\u2019s something to the argument that it\u2019s just not relevant. There\u2019s no conceivable possibility of the kind of social change that they\u2019re talking about within the time scale that\u2019s necessary to solve this problem. So we have to be willing to face reality on these matters, too. We have problems that are imminent, urgent. Couple of decades means urgent. This doesn\u2019t mean everybody\u2019s going to die in 20 years. It means processes will be set in motion that won\u2019t be reversible. And then it\u2019s just a matter of time till it\u2019s all over. We are now in a position where we have to solve this now, very soon, this generation. And if the geoengineering solutions are not going to do it, it doesn\u2019t mean should stop working on them. There was an announcement of some new governmental fusion experimental effort, that\u2019s worth pursuing. If we can ever get fusion, a lot of problems would be solved. But we\u2019re not going to have it on any scale relevant within the time frame of dealing with this problem."

Automation usually gets thought of in the way you could lose jobs from it. I\u2019ve seen talk about it in an interesting, the optimistic way, that if you could harness the right politics around it, automation could be a way towards a better, more economically dignified future for people. How do you think about automation and its role in the future of the economy?",
    "output": "NOAM CHOMSKY: Any on Earth boring, destructive, dangerous work should be automated to the extent possible. That frees people up to do better work, more creative work, more fulfilling work, safer work. So that\u2019s all to the good. How automation takes place is a matter of social and economic policy. It can take place in many ways. Let me just mention one important careful study, which showed what the choices are that the former colleague of mine find historian of technology, David Noble, unfortunately died a couple of years ago. His major work was on the machine tool industry, the core of much of modern industrial capitalism. By the 1950s, the machine tool industry was beginning to be automated. Numerical processing was coming in. Computers were coming in. Waves of potentially changing the machine-tool tool industry using the new tools that were coming along. There were two ways to do it. Both ways were experimented with. One way, de-skilled machinists that replaced skilled machinists, first of all, by automation, but also by turning the people themselves into robots, who just followed orders and so on. That was one way. The other way to do it put more power into the hands of skilled machinists. OK. Still using the same technology. As Noble shows pretty convincingly, there was no economic reason to pick the first way. It was picked, it was picked. That\u2019s the way it was picked, but for power reasons. The ownership management class wants to deskill people, wants to turn them into subordinate subjects, not independent agents and actors. So they pick the mode of automation which deskilled machinists still around, but not skilled, and turn them into servants rather than controllers and actors. That happens all the time. Let\u2019s take another case. 2009, the economy was collapsing. The auto industry essentially collapsed. That was pretty much nationalized, then use the term. But basically, the Obama administration took over most of the auto industry. Well, there were a couple of choices. One choice was to turn it back to the former owners, bail them out, so taxpayer pays them out, give them term ownership and control back to them, maybe different faces but the same class, and have them go back to what they were doing before on producing cars to create traffic jams and pollution and destroy the environment. That was one choice. The choice that was taken. There was another choice. Turn the auto industry over to the work force, and the stakeholders, the community. Let them have control. Let them think through what they ought to do. Maybe they\u2019ll decide on the sensible thing. [MUSIC PLAYING]"

That\u2019s the immediate light that should go off in your brain when you ever hear unanimity on some complex topic. So let\u2019s ask, what\u2019s the Chinese threat?",
    "output": "EZRA KLEIN: I\u2019ll give you the answer I\u2019ve gotten because I have very complicated feelings about this. The answer I\u2019ve gotten is that particularly, over the past decade, China\u2019s moved in a much more authoritarian direction. They\u2019ve become more expansionist, domestically, I\u2019m talking about there. They\u2019ve become more expansionist in the South China Sea really launched a horrifying domestic repression campaign against the Uyghurs. And so to the extent, you want there to be a mega economy that is setting international rules and structures that the direction China is going makes it scary for China or scarier for China to be that rule setter in the future. That is, I think, the argument I\u2019ve been given. NOAM CHOMSKY: China is becoming more authoritarian internally. I think that\u2019s pretty bad. Is it a threat to us? No, it\u2019s not a threat to us. Let\u2019s take what\u2019s happening with the Uyghur. Pretty hard to get good evidence, but there\u2019s enough evidence to show that there\u2019s very severe repression going on. Let me ask you a simple question. Is the situation of the Uyghurs, a million people who\u2019ve been through education camps, is that worse than the situation of, say, two million and twice that many people in Gaza? I mean, are the Uyghur having their power plants destroyed, their sewage plants destroyed, subjected to regular bombing? Is it not happening to them? Not to my knowledge. So yes, it shouldn\u2019t be happening. We should protest it. It has one crucial difference from Gaza. Namely, in the Uyghur case, there\u2019s not a lot that we can do about it, unfortunately. In the Gaza case, we can do everything about it since we were responsible for it, we can stop it tomorrow. That\u2019s the difference. OK? So yes, that\u2019s a very bad thing among other bad things in the world. But to say that it\u2019s a threat to us is a little misleading. Well, let\u2019s talk to the one case of expansionism, which is real. The South China Sea, that\u2019s real. China is taking actions in violation of international law. It\u2019s trying to take control of the South China Sea. Or to put it differently, it\u2019s trying to do what we do in all of the oceans of the world, including the Western Pacific. They\u2019re trying to do that in the South China Sea. And they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. That\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s crucially important for their security. That\u2019s where all their commercial traffic goes right through \u2014 South China Sea, Straits of Malacca, which are controlled by Chinese enemies or allies. So yeah, they\u2019re doing the wrong thing there. That\u2019s the thing that\u2019s a little bit familiar to us because we do it all over the world, OK? And that\u2019s the kind of threat that should be dealt with by diplomacy and negotiations. EZRA KLEIN: So what I want to say, I agree with a bunch of what you said here. That\u2019s why I said I have very complicated feelings in this conversation. There\u2019s a lot China does wrong, but the idea that America is going to tell people that they don\u2019t have legitimate national interest in controlling nearby waterways seems a little odd."

And they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. No, we should deal with it by diplomacy and negotiations, just like much else in the world.

That\u2019s one of the most repressive governments anywhere. But I\u2019m asking another question, we talk uniformly without exception about the Chinese threat, what are we talking about? In fact, just as a rule of thumb, if anything is discussed as if it\u2019s just obvious, we don\u2019t have to talk about it, everyone agrees, but we know it\u2019s complicated.

In other words, it\u2019s saying, let\u2019s prepare ourselves for the total end of human society. I mean, is that even minimally sane?",
    "output": "Trump systematically eliminated step by step what was remaining of the arms control regime, was painstakingly put into place since Eisenhower actually, step by step, little steps, progress, and so on. Let\u2019s get rid of it one piece after another. The wrecking ball has to hit everything. Biden got in just in time to be able to accept the Russian offers to maintain the New START agreement, not a great agreement, but at least it\u2019s something. Trump plainly wasn\u2019t going to sign it. Meanwhile, the United States and other countries, Russia and China, but primarily the United States has been developing new weapons of mass destruction and doing it in a way which is highly provocative. So you go back to August 2019 when Trump dismantled the INF treaty, the Reagan-Gorbachev treaty, which was very effective in cutting back the war in Europe. Destroyed it. What did he do? Didn\u2019t just say we\u2019re dismantling the treaty. Immediately, within days, the United States carried out a test of a missile that violated the treaty. That\u2019s telling the Russians, hey, boys, let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s go and see if we can destroy each other. I mean, this is the behavior of people who are insane. There is no way to fight a nuclear war with any adversary of any capacity. It\u2019s as simple and clear as that. The destruction would be so enormous that you wouldn\u2019t even want to live in that world. You can\u2019t even contemplate it. The fact that we\u2019re even talking about these things is mind boggling. Now, in fact, there is a way out. There is an international treaty just was accepted by the U.N. General Assembly a couple of months ago, the Treaty on Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Prohibition, that means no manufacturing them, no storing them. Prohibition, get rid of them. Well, none of the nuclear states joined the agreement, unfortunately. But if the U.S. wants to demonstrate this leadership role that American intellectuals like to talk about, OK, here\u2019s a way to do it. Let\u2019s take the lead in making efforts to move towards accepting the Treaty on Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. I mean, I should say that\u2019s not an extreme position. It\u2019s been advocated by people like Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, late secretary of state under Reagan, Sam Nunn, people who\u2019ve been right at the heart of the nuclear weapon system. They understand that you can\u2019t have a nuclear war. And we got to make moves towards eliminating. There\u2019s another way to do it, a very significant way \u2014 establish nuclear weapons-free zones around the world. Doesn\u2019t end the problem, but it limits it. And it also indicates symbolically, which is not insignificant, indicates that we want to opt out of this. It\u2019s totally wrong. We don\u2019t want to be part of it."

    "input": "DB: In the United States, COVID-19 has resulted in more than seven hundred thousand dead. Globally, the death toll is in the millions. Vaccines have been effective, yet there\u2019s a significant resistance to getting vaccinated, particularly in the United States. Why? What makes some people susceptible to conspiracy theories about getting vaccinated?",
    "output": "We should look at exactly what\u2019s happening. If you look at global maps, like the kind that theNew York Timesposts every day, the United States stands out. It\u2019s the main global hot spot outside of Mongolia and a couple of others. If you look closely, it\u2019s not the United States. It\u2019s selected parts of the United States. Overwhelmingly, it\u2019s the old Confederacy and a couple of outliers like Idaho and Wyoming, which are rock-ribbed Republican states. There\u2019s even been analysis by counties by now, and it turns out that there\u2019s a quite sharp difference between counties that voted for Joe Biden and counties that voted for Donald Trump. So, to a very substantial extent, it\u2019s a partisan issue. Parts of the Left have bought into this, too. They\u2019re not statistically significant as compared with the mass refusal on the part of Republicans. And, in fact, the last poll I saw showed that over 50 percent of Republicans said they were not going to get vaccinated. So it\u2019s not just that the country is refusing \u2014 very substantially, it\u2019s a Republican issue. It\u2019s very serious. The hospitals in Republican areas like Idaho and Alabama are being crushed by COVID cases. Some states have had to stop providing regular services in hospitals because they have no beds. (Actually, in a minor way, that happened to me, too: I couldn\u2019t get to a hospital that I needed to because they had no beds. It wasn\u2019t terrible. I survived.) Apart from the social cost, which is huge, they\u2019re endangering people. The unvaccinated are endangering others. They\u2019re severely endangering children who can\u2019t get vaccinated yet. They have no protection. They\u2019re even endangering the vaccinated. I mean, the vaccine is very effective, but not 100 percent. So they\u2019re endangering the vaccinated, too. And on top of that, they\u2019re creating a pool in which the virus can mutate freely, maybe leading to variants that might not even be treatable. It could be a raging, untreatable pandemic. Why is this done? Liberty? There\u2019s no such liberty. There\u2019s no liberty that allows you to drive through a red light because you feel like it and you don\u2019t want to be inhibited. Nobody\u2019s ever claimed such a liberty. It\u2019s outlandish. You want to hurt people? Okay. Go find a plot of land somewhere, sit on it, don\u2019t take any benefits from the government, and don\u2019t take any responsibilities. The whole libertarian thing is pure nonsense. Furthermore, we\u2019ve had vaccine mandates \u2014 strict ones. Much stricter than now, for years. You can\u2019t send your kid to school without a vaccine, and rightly. Why should you be able to endanger other children? That\u2019s been in place for a long time. There are no real mandates now. What\u2019s called \u201cmandates\u201d have an alternative: you can agree to get tested every week or two. This is, I think, a symptom of severe social disorder \u2014 social collapse of a party that has simply gone rogue. That\u2019s not just my opinion. Recently, theFinancial Times \u2014the major business newspaper in the world, sober, conservative \u2014 their leading correspondent, Martin Wolf, a highly respected conservative analyst,wrote a columnin which he said it\u2019s just indescribable. He said the Republican Party has become a group of crazed radicals dedicated to reactionary policies. The Republicans have been holding the country hostage by refusing to agree to the perfectly normal procedure of raising the debt ceiling to account for things that have already been done. When Trump was in office, he made a huge increase in the deficit with his lavish gifts to the rich; the Democrats went along with it, raised the debt ceiling every time it was necessary. Republicans won\u2019t do it. In fact, they finally just now agreed, as long as conditions were imposed to block any form of mandate for small and medium-size businesses. In other words, you want to harm the employees in a restaurant? Feel free to do it. It\u2019s your right to harm them. That\u2019s the Republican Party. They also tried to cut off funding for Afghan refugees. I mean, the political leadership is just a gang of sadists. And the shamelessness is indescribable. Take the hearing for Milley. DB: General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He went through denunciations by a series of Republicans, Josh Hawley and a bunch of other frauds, condemning him for the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Take a look at the record. Until about a month ago, the Republican Party national website hailed the great genius Trump for arranging a much worse withdrawal. In February 2020, Trump simply gave away the store. He, of course, didn\u2019t inform the Afghan government, obviously not the Afghan people. Why should he care about them? He made an arrangement with the Taliban for US forces to withdraw in May 2021. Worst possible time \u2014 beginning of the fighting season. Essentially no conditions. Do whatever you like. The only condition is, don\u2019t fire at American troops, it won\u2019t look good for me. Biden came along and somewhat improved the awful Trump arrangements; he put it off a couple of months, a little bit of minimal time to accommodate, and added a few conditions that Trump hadn\u2019t put in place. The Republican Party was lauding Trump for his historic achievement until the moment when it began to collapse. Then they turned on a dime, all of them berating Milley and others for carrying out an improved version of the policy that they had been lauding as a historic achievement when the hero that they worship was proposing it. The word \u201cshameless\u201d doesn\u2019t cover this. There are no words. It\u2019s not just this. That\u2019s why large parts of the Republican Party are denying global warming. If you tune in to Fox News and Breitbart, you\u2019re listening to the leadership of the Republican Party. That\u2019s all you hear. Maybe the virus is a bioweapon created by the Chinese to attack Americans. That\u2019s about 35 percent of Republicans. Maybe Bill Gates is trying to put a chip in your head so he can control you. Maybe the government is run by an elite group of sadistic pedophiles who are trying to torture children. That\u2019s about 25 percent of Republicans. If you\u2019re stuck in that bubble, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re hearing from a political leadership that has lost even minimal commitment to the functioning of democracy, these are the results you get. And it\u2019s very straightforward; there\u2019s nothing hidden. Mitch McConnell came right out and said, again, as he did when Barack Obama was elected: our responsibility is to make the country ungovernable, to make sure that nothing can be done that would benefit the American people. Sensible strategy. If the population is harmed sufficiently, they can then come along and blame it on the Democrats,Tucker Carlsonand Sean Hannity will echo it, and then maybe they can come back to power."

    "input": "Let\u2019s start with August 9. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) came out withits latest report, very dire. It said, far more clearly than before, that we\u2019re at a critical moment. We have to start reducing fossil fuels steadily right now, continuing until we\u2019re free of them by essentially mid-century. That was August 9. What happened on August 10? Joe Biden issued an appeal to OPEC, the oil cartel, to increase oil production so as to reduce gas prices in the United States, which will help his electoral prospects. Is that the party we\u2019re supposed to be lauding?",
    "output": "There\u2019s plenty to condemn about the Democrats. They\u2019re a political party that does plenty of wrong things. They\u2019re not a rogue insurgency that is committed to serving a narrow constituency of extreme wealth and doesn\u2019t give a damn how much they harm the country and the world. That\u2019s not a political party anymore. It\u2019s off the spectrum. You can rank [the Republicans] among the ultraright parties in Europe with neo-fascist origins. DB: The IPCC report, which was three thousand pages and the work of over two hundred scientists, warned of the extreme dangers the planet is facing. Nevertheless \u2014 take our great neighbor to the north, Canada \u2014 just recently, Enbridge, a major Canadian corporation,announced its extensionof a pipeline from the tar sands in Alberta to Wisconsin (tar sands being the dirtiest oil on the planet). This is happening despite years of opposition from environmentalists and indigenous groups. Take a look at the business press, especially the petroleum journals. The major oil companies are absolutely euphoric. They\u2019re beside themselves. They\u2019re finding new areas to explore. The current budget for the US government continues to provide subsidies to fossil fuel companies. Republicans wouldn\u2019t tolerate anything else. Canada\u2019s bad enough, and other countries aren\u2019t doing that wonderfully. But the United States is indescribable. former political organization now calling itself the Republican Party is dedicated to accelerating the race to catastrophe. Take a look at the Republican states. Republican legislators aren\u2019t even trying to hide it. They\u2019ve got to race to catastrophe to enrich the energy corporations as much as possible before we reach apocalypse. That\u2019s one part of the fading American democracy. Take a look at the one party that\u2019s still functioning, the Democratic Party. There\u2019s a major split within it that offers the opportunity, at least, to push forward on the programs that are well-known, feasible \u2014 to not only mitigate the crisis but lead to a much better world. They are on the table. There\u2019s aGreen New Deal resolutionby Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ed Markey, senior senator from Massachusetts. It gives a detailed outline of quite feasible proposals, well within cost range, that could solve the crisis and lead the way to a much better society. It\u2019s a resolution. That\u2019s a step forward. It got that far because of extensive popular activism \u2014 mostly among young people, the Sunrise Movement and others. The resolution\u2019s details are approximately the same as what was produced by the International Energy Agency, originally a producer-based group, which recognized that we have to do something about this. It\u2019s very similar to the quite detailed extensive proposals ofmy coauthor, Robert Pollin, a leading economist who\u2019s worked hard on this, as has Jeffrey Sachs, another important economist whose somewhat different model comes out withpretty much the same conclusions. It\u2019s all within range and can be done. It\u2019s on paper. The Republicans are going to kill it. That\u2019s a given. They don\u2019t care what happens to the planet; they don\u2019t give a damn. They have other commitments: their own power and the superrich. In fact, if you look at their commitment, it is unbelievable. Take a look at the negotiations that have been going on in Congress. The Republicans established an absolute red line: no increase in taxes for the superrich and the corporate sector. You cannot touch Trump\u2019s one legislative achievement, a tax scam that stabbed the country in the back, including the working classes and the middle classes, in order to enrich the very rich. That\u2019s a red line. Furthermore, another part of the red line is that you can\u2019t fund the IRS to enable it to catch tax cheaters \u2014 rich people and corporations with huge numbers of corporate lawyers who figure out how to rob the population of trillions of dollars. You can\u2019t fund the IRS to investigate them. That\u2019s the former Republican Party. We\u2019re looking at a group of radical sadists. Turn to the Democrats. They\u2019re split. The Clintonite-Obama type, neoliberal, Wall Street\u2013oriented Democrats who pretty much run the party apparatus \u2014 they\u2019re reluctant. They\u2019re not going to push. And some of the right-wing Democrats, mislabeled moderate, likeJoe ManchinandKyrsten Sinema, look like total cynics flush with corporate money \u2014 they are holding back on even minimal things. Sinema, for example, won\u2019t even say what she would agree to in the reconciliation bill. She just won\u2019t agree. \u201cWhat would you agree to?\u201d \u201cSorry, can\u2019t say.\u201d The Democratic Party is split between these groups, on the one hand, and progressive, mostly young people, who are pressuring them to try to save us from destruction on the climate, on the pandemic, on the breakdown of society. Thereconciliation billmoves to give the population some respite from the neoliberal assault of the last forty years, to give some chance to respond to the major attack on the general population. There\u2019s nothing radical in it. In fact, one of the editors of theFinancial Times, in a semi-joke, said that if Bernie Sanders was in Germany, he could be running on the conservative party ticket, the Christian Democrats. It\u2019s true. His major proposals \u2014 universal health care, free higher education \u2014 in Germany, that\u2019s the right-wing party. The United States has gone so far to the right that even policies that are normal in most of the rest of the world are considered radical. DB: Someone who\u2019s not mincing words is the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.He said, \u201cWe continue to destroy the things on which we depend for life on Earth. Ice caps and glaciers continue to melt, sea-level rise is accelerating, the ocean is dying, and biodiversity is collapsing. . . . We really are out of time. We must act now to prevent further irreversible damage.\u201d"

    "output": "We can\u2019t predict precisely, but we are moving toward irreversible tipping points. Every month we wait, the problem gets harder to deal with. If we had dealt with it ten years ago, it would be much less dire today. If we had dealt with it thirty years ago, when it was perfectly clear where we were heading, then [it would have been] far easier. You recall that the first Bush administration refused even to join the Kyoto Protocol. We have to keep to the high priorities: enrich the very rich and maintain massive profits for the corporate sector. What happens to the country and the world is secondary. We don\u2019t know exactly when the tipping points will come. But they\u2019ll come. In fact, some of them may have come already. If not, we\u2019ll reach them pretty soon. We\u2019ll get to an irreversible tipping point, a series of them. It doesn\u2019t mean that everybody dies tomorrow. The country will survive, other countries will survive. But we\u2019re on a course toward total apocalypse. Meanwhile, we are incidentally destroying other species at an incredible rate that hasn\u2019t been seen for sixty-five million years. All of this is known. There are, more importantly, clear measures to deal with it \u2014 and, in fact, some positive steps. Take West Virginia, where their own senator, Joe Manchin, is working very hard to harm the people as much as he can in service to his corporate masters. But the population of West Virginia is beginning to see the light. It\u2019s a coal state. The United Mine Workers of America recently agreed to a transition program, in which there would be a transition from a coal-based economy for West Virginia \u2014 which has to disappear, otherwise we won\u2019t be around \u2014 to a renewable energy economy. They have the capacity to do it. The transition proposal took into account the needs of the working people who will be affected by loss of jobs. New kinds of jobs, training, and better jobs are all part of the transition plan. Bob Pollin has been quite active in working with labor unions in West Virginia, Ohio, and California. Many of them are moving in this direction \u2014 so it is possible. We might remember that, if we go back fifty years, the leaders of the environmental movement were the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union \u2014Tony Mazzocchi\u2018s union. They were the ones pressuring people to deal seriously with the environment. And in fact, they were the ones who suffered immediately from the effects of pollution. That can happen again. There are possible forces that can work on it. And activists can do something \u2014 they must, in fact. It\u2019s the only hope. The Republican Party is almost a lost cause. I say \u201calmost\u201d because, if you look closely, younger Republicans are not as insane and despicable as the party\u2019s leadership. They are more open to concern about these issues. That\u2019s a place for hope, too. They\u2019re not Susan Collins and Josh Hawley, so you can have some hope there \u2014 and that should be pressed. Among the general population, including Republicans, they\u2019re reachable. They\u2019re stuck in a Fox News and Republican leadership bubble, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be moved. It\u2019ll take effort and work, but they\u2019re human beings. They care about their children. They care about the environment. And they can be reached. In fact, among them are many committed environmentalists. It\u2019s very interesting to read the detailed studies, like Arlie Hochschild\u2019s bookStrangers in Their Own Land, which came out a couple years ago, about the Louisiana Bayou. She was working for years in an area that is bright red, solid Republican. The ultraright representative wants to destroy everything. The area is called \u201cCancer Alley.\u201d People are dying from cancer from the pollution from the chemical plants. They know it. They don\u2019t like it. She was working with people who are dedicated environmentalists, working hard to try to clean the place up, turn away from the polluting industries \u2014 and who vote for the far-right Republican who is at the extreme of trying to destroy the environment."

And, sadder still, there always is a chorus of willing intellectuals to say calming words about benign or altruistic empires, as if one shouldn\u2019t trust the evidence of one\u2019s eyes watching the destruction and the misery and death brought by the latest mission civilisatrice (civilizing mission).\u201d"

    "output": "He\u2019s absolutely right. What\u2019s called \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d is mistaken in two respects. For one thing, the claims about what makes us exceptional are easily disproven. For another, there\u2019s nothing exceptional about it. It was the same with every other major power. While France was officially committed to \u201cexterminating\u201d the Algerians, French intellectuals were praising the civilizing mission of France. While Britain was carrying out some of its worst atrocities in India, John Stuart Mill \u2014 a respectable intellectual, if anybody was \u2014 was writing about it. He knew all about it. He was an official of the East India Company while this was going on: huge massacres repressing an Indian uprising, moves to invade and conquer more of India so that Britain could extend its monopoly of the opium trade. The opium trade was the biggest narcotrafficking racket in history, a source of a lot of British wealth, [carried out] in order to break into China by force and destroy it. While that was going on, John Stuart Mill wrote an essay on intervention, which is read in law schools as if it was an opposition to intervention. But when you read it, it turns out that what he was saying was, Britain is such an angelic power that others can\u2019t understand us. They heap obloquy upon us. They think we\u2019re working for cross ends, because we are so much above the human race that they cannot perceive our dedication to the highest goals. That includes bringing civilization to India, to barbaric India. And it\u2019s our responsibility to do it by smashing them in the face, murdering them, and conquering them to extend our opium monopoly so we can break into China. He didn\u2019t add that part, I added it. But that\u2019s what he knew was happening. Well, that\u2019s John Stuart Mill \u2014 not a right-winger, the peak of human enlightenment. We can go on. If we had records from Attila the Hun, we\u2019d probably find the same thing. You have to try hard to find an exception in human history. And the role of the intellectual is to praise it, to say how wonderful we are. Oh, maybe we make mistakes. After all, anybody can make mistakes. But we\u2019re basically dedicated to the highest good. Take one example: the end of the Vietnam War, 1975. Every big name had to write an article about it. I reviewed them. They\u2019re quite interesting. They range from the hawks to the doves. The hawks were saying, \u201cWe were stabbed in the back. The peace movement killed us. If we\u2019d been able to fight harder, we could have won.\u201d That\u2019s on the right \u2014 that\u2019s not interesting. What\u2019s interesting is the so-called left. You get people like Anthony Lewis, about as strong an antiwar voice as you could find anywhere in the mainstream. He wrotean article in the New York Timesin which he said the war began with \u201cblundering efforts to do good.\u201d Evidence that these were efforts to do good? No, that\u2019s an axiom. They were \u201cefforts to do good\u201d because we did them. Blundering? Well, it didn\u2019t work. So it started with blundering efforts to do good by definition. But by 1969, it was clearly a disaster. We couldn\u2019t bring democracy to the people of South Vietnam at a cost that was acceptable to ourselves. That\u2019s the extreme criticism on the Left. Were we trying to bring democracy? You don\u2019t have to argue that that\u2019s true by definition again. Was it an effort to do good? By definition, it was, because we\u2019re so magnificent. Is the only issue that the cost was too high? Well, you could think of some other issues. Could it possibly have been the worst crime of aggression since World War II, of the kind for which German war criminals were hanged at Nuremberg? Well, it couldn\u2019t have been that, even though it was. At the same time, US public opinion was being sampled. The main intensive studies were the Council on Foreign Relations, which does extensive regular studies of public opinion on foreign affairs. In 1975, they asked a lot of questions. One was, \u201cWhat do you think about the war in Vietnam?\u201d It turned out that 70 percent of the unwashed masses said the war was fundamentally wrong and immoral, not a mistake. A mere 70 percent. They continued asking that question for about fifteen years and got pretty much the same answer. Finally, the director of research, a good liberal political scientist, asked himself the obvious question: \u201cWhy are they giving this answer?\u201d And he gave the response: \u201cThey\u2019re saying this because too many Americans died.\u201d Maybe. But maybe they were saying it because they thought the war was fundamentally wrong and immoral. There would have been a way to find that out by asking the question, but you can\u2019t do that \u2014 because it\u2019s axiomatic that they must be like the liberal doves, only concerned with the cost to us. It\u2019s got to be. What else could it be? Well, we don\u2019t know. I have a suspicion that a lot of them thought it was fundamentally wrong and immoral, but that couldn\u2019t enter the discussion. If you said anything like that, you are like what McGeorge Bundy, the national security adviser for John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson,wrote inForeign Affairs. Yes, we made some mistakes, some things went wrong, and it\u2019s worth discussing them. Then he said there are \u201cthe wild men in the wings,\u201d people like you and me. The wild men in the wings who say it wasn\u2019t just mistaken tactics, there was something worse: a crime. Such people are obviously so crazy that we can\u2019t even talk to them. They\u2019re the wild men in the wings. That\u2019s the answer to the question. Every other great society has done pretty much the same thing. There is no American exceptionalism. It\u2019s a repeat of other great powers and their violence and terror. People talk about \u201cendless wars\u201d \u2014 the endless wars for the United States began in 1783 and have not stopped since. As soon as the British yoke was lifted, the colonists set forth on their mission. One of theleading diplomatic historiesof the United States, by Thomas Bailey, says that the colonists were free to set forth on their mission \u201cof felling trees and Indians\u201d and extending to the natural borders. It\u2019s pretty honest. We had to turn to felling trees and Indians and extending the natural borders. That means invading and attacking the Indian nations, exterminating them, smashing them to pieces, breaking treaties, and genocidal attacks, right to the end of the century. Meanwhile, they picked up half of Mexico, in what President Ulysses S. Grant called one of the most \u201cwicked wars\u201d in history. Accurately, it was a war of aggression. Arizona, where I\u2019m living right now; California; stealing Hawaii from its inhabitants by force and guile; moving on to invade the Philippines, killing a couple of hundred thousand people, then on to intervention, violence, terror, aggression. That\u2019s American exceptionalism. And it\u2019s not exceptional. Other great imperial powers have acted similarly or worse. Now take our predecessor, Britain. Where did British wealth come from? Piracy. During the Elizabethan era, British pirates were robbing Spanish ships on the high seas to steal bullion. That was punishable by death. That was Sir Francis Drake, a great hero. That\u2019s a large part of British capital. Then it switched to slavery, the worst slavery in human history. Cotton was the oil of the early Industrial Revolution. The British got it from their colonies, along with sugar, tea, and tobacco, then cotton from the American South. One of the reasons for their conquering Egypt was to get more cotton. After slavery came narcotrafficking. Opium was one of the main commodities in international trade in the nineteenth century, for the reasons I mentioned. That\u2019s British wealth. Look at France. An estimated 20 percent of French wealth came from vicious, murderous slavery in Haiti. When the Haitians finally won their freedom, France thanked them, of course, by indemnifying the people who lost their property. You\u2019ve got to pay them off, by imposing a debt burden on Haiti to pay the French for daring to become free \u2014 a debt that was not paid off until the 1940s. There was recently a French commission, headed, I think, by R\u00e9gis Debray, a leftist, that discussed whether France ought to do something about it. They concluded, \u201cNo, we have no responsibility.\u201d That\u2019s the civilizing mission. Look at Germany. Some of the first genocides of the twentieth century in Africa, in Namibia. Look at Italy. Genocide in Libya in the early part of the century, and another one in the late 1920s in Libya. The invasion of Ethiopia. They compensate for that by forcing people fleeing from Libya either back to misery where they\u2019re fleeing from or to death in the Mediterranean. That\u2019s the way they deal with their legacy. DB: You mentioned exterminating. In the book that you did a decade ago calledGaza in Crisis, with the Israeli historian Ilan Papp\u00e9, you have a chapter entitled \u201cExterminate All the Brutes,\u201d which are the exact words of the deranged Kurtz character in Joseph Conrad\u2019s famous novelHeart of Darkness. Actually, I was borrowing the word \u201cexterminate\u201d from a more directly relevant source, John Quincy Adams, the secretary of state and president, the intellectual father of manifest destiny. He was responsible for some of the major atrocities [of the era], the Seminole War in Florida and others. In his later years, reflecting on what happened, he lamented the fate of \u201cthat hapless race of native Americans, which we are exterminating with such merciless and perfidious cruelty.\u201d That was before the worst of the atrocities, which were in California later. That\u2019s the father of Manifest Destiny. He was right. He was not the first to use it. The secretary of war under Washington, Henry Knox, said something similar: We\u2019re exterminating the natives in ways that are worse than those of the conquistadors in South America. They knew what they were doing. George Washington said, the Indians are like wolves, savages in human form, \u201cbeasts\u201d that have to be driven into the wilderness. That was George Washington. He was known by the Iroquois as the \u201ctown destroyer\u201d \u2014 because even before the Revolutionary War was over, he launched a major campaign of destruction among the Iroquois nations. There were exceptions, of course. But that was the overwhelming pattern. That\u2019s the mainstream. You always have wild men in the wings, who are usually treated pretty badly, depending on the nature of the society, but this goes all through history. Go back to classical Greece. The guy who had to commit suicide by taking the hemlock was the man who was guilty of corrupting the youth of Athens by asking too many questions. We don\u2019t want that kind of wild man in the wings. It\u2019s pretty much standard throughout history. The kind of treatment they get depends on the society and who they are. So, in the United States, if you\u2019re a privileged person like Edward Said or me, punishments are not too bad. Maybe vilification, denunciation. Said had to have police protection. He had a buzzer in his apartment so he could call the police in case he was attacked. If you\u2019re Fred Hampton, a Black Panther organizer, you can be assassinated by the national political police. It depends on who you are."

In an interview I did with him in early September, Tariq Ali called what happened in Afghanistan \u201ca huge blow to the American empire,\u201d andhe said that\u201cNo amount of spin can cover up this debacle.\u201d Is it a bit early to be writing the obituary of the American empire?",
    "output": "As far as the American empire is concerned, it\u2019s a blip. Literally a blip. From the point of view of the American empire, the invasion of Afghanistan was a mistake. George W. Bush and his surrounding courtiers \u2014 Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney \u2014 decided to invade Afghanistan without any strategic objective. The best description of what they were doing was given by the most respected figure of the anti-Taliban resistance in Afghanistan, Abdul Haq. In October 2001, he hadan important interviewwith Anatol Lieven, who\u2019s a specialist on Central Asia. Lieven asked him, Why do you think the Americans are invading? Haq said, They know they\u2019re going to kill plenty of Afghans. They\u2019re going to undermine our efforts to overthrow the Taliban from within, which Haq outlined, which were feasible. But they don\u2019t care, he said. They want to show their muscle and intimidate everyone. So they\u2019re invading. That\u2019s pretty much what Donald Rumsfeld was saying. We now know what he was saying. At the time, the Taliban offered to surrender, totally \u2014 which, of course, meant giving up any remnants of al-Qaeda that were there. Rumsfeld\u2019s answer was, \u201cWe do not negotiate surrenders. We want to smash you to pieces.\u201d He didn\u2019t say this \u2014 I\u2019m adding what was in his head. We want to smash you to pieces to show our muscle, intimidate everyone, then go on to our real targets. We don\u2019t care about Afghanistan. We want to go on to Iraq, then on to the rest of the Middle East. All that actually was publicized. I\u2019m not making that up. So they invaded Afghanistan. But they didn\u2019t know that al-Qaeda was responsible for 9/11. In fact, eight months after 9/11, the head of the FBI, Robert Mueller, gave his first major press conference, in which he was asked, of course, what have you found out about 9/11? And he said \u2014 this is after probably the greatest investigation in history \u2014 \u201cWe assume that it was probably al-Qaeda, but we haven\u2019t been able to prove it.\u201d That\u2019s eight months after the United States invaded to show its muscle and intimidate everyone. Of course, that\u2019s not the story you read. But it\u2019s the fact. If they wanted to capture al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and others, a small police operation would have sufficed \u2014 probably with the cooperation of the Taliban, who at that point were quite eager to get rid of this burden. They couldn\u2019t just give him over to foreigners. That would be a horrible violation of the tribal code. But they probably would have cooperated. In fact, they made various offers about extradition. But nothing. \u201cWe do not negotiate surrender.\u201d Bush, the decider, was asked later, \u201cWhat do you think about al-Qaeda?\u201d He said, \u201cWe don\u2019t really care, we\u2019re not interested in them. We don\u2019t know where they are. We\u2019re interested in the bigger game.\u201d"

    "output": "Pulling out of Afghanistan was, in fact, withdrawing from a mistake for once. It didn\u2019t have the kind of strategic objectives that the Vietnam War did \u2014 which were incidentally, partially achieved. The Vietnam War was partially a success. If you look back at the original motivations, back in the early 1950s, they were largely achieved. In Afghanistan, nothing was achieved. It was a mistake. It\u2019s a disaster for Afghans, but it\u2019s not our business. Now, the question is, can we do something for compensation? Can we help them in some way? Well, what we ought to be doing is joining with the regional powers \u2014 China, Central Asian governments, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Russia \u2014 to try to offer whatever assistance we can to the Afghans, so they can somehow overcome the crisis of forty years of war, which we were involved in all along. They\u2019re desperate, they\u2019re starving, they don\u2019t have food. We can help with that. What we\u2019re actually doing is holding on to their funds, which happen to be in the New York banks, holding on to them and not giving them back. Pressuring the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank not to give loans. We actually are joining with India, your favorite country [editor\u2019s note: Barsamian has been banned from India since 2011], to undermine the efforts of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to take steps to assist the Afghans. The United States is not a member \u2014 they don\u2019t accept the United States. But joining with its US master to undercut the efforts of the regional powers to do something to reduce the terror and violence that the Afghans are suffering by offering them some aid, trying to work with them, trying to integrate them into the region somehow \u2014 India and the United States are blocking it. Well, it doesn\u2019t have to happen. So that\u2019s what we can do now. As well as, of course, providing ample assistance to the Afghan refugees. That\u2019s our first responsibility. Unfortunately, we have a sadistic organization that controls half the government and just tried to cut aid to Afghans from the agreement to raise the debt ceiling. Fortunately, that didn\u2019t work. That\u2019s the country we\u2019re in."

I have good friends who I greatly respect and who are marvelous people, who don\u2019t understand this. Quaker activists, Catholic activists who go into the submarine base in Connecticut and smash the hulls of nuclear submarines without any preparation for it. The workforce is infuriated. Why are you taking our jobs? What the hell are you doing? A bunch of crazies. The general community doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. They go to trial. They get to stand up and say, \u201cGod told me to do it,\u201d or whatever it is. A lot of movement resources are devoted to defending them at the trial; you go down and testify.

And he repeated words that Trump has begun using more and more about, you know, they\u2019re helping the \u201cinvaders\u201d come in. If you could respond specifically to that?",
    "output": "NOAMCHOMSKY:Well, I think it\u2019s pretty clear that he\u2019s whipping up terror about invasions, people pouring across the border to plan to kill us all, to destroy our civilization. You take people who are already somewhat disturbed and living under harsh conditions, this can incite them to acts of extreme violence against targets like the Jewish temple. All the anti-Semitic tropes are pointing in that direction, but most\u2014also against Afro-Americans, immigrants, any vulnerable population or population that\u2019s easy to target for lots of cultural and historical reasons, all this amplified by the loud speaker up in the White House and his minions, who are doing what they can to terrorize the population, create the conditions under which you can get something like the attack on the synagogue. AMYGOODMAN:So, I wanted to turn, then, to a clip of the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, who was interviewed by Ayman Mohyeldin onMSNBCon Sunday, so it was soon after the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre. Dermer was asked if Trump\u2019s rhetoric is in part to blame for the massacre. RONDERMER:I see a lot of bad people, on both sides, who attack Jews. This is not the first time that a Jewish community has been attacked. It is the worst anti-Semitic attack in, oh, 200 years in the United States, that you have 11 dead. AMYGOODMAN:Dermer said no world leader had made stronger statements against anti-Semitism than Trump. And then he went on to blame both sides. RONDERMER:To simply say that this is because of one person or it only comes on one side is to not understand the history of anti-Semitism or the reality of anti-Semitism. One of the big forces in college campuses today is anti-Semitism. And those anti-Semites are usually not neo-Nazis on college campuses. They\u2019re coming from the radical left. AMYGOODMAN:This is right after the white supremacist attack on the synagogue, and the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. is now injecting, saying this comes from both sides. If you could respond to this? Interestingly, two days later, when Trump and his family went to Pittsburgh, the only\u2014and this is pointed out inThe New York Times\u2014the only public official standing there to greet him was Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer. People like the Pittsburgh mayor and the others said this was not the time to come. NOAMCHOMSKY:Well, I think it\u2019s quite easy to understand. There is an alliance of reactionary repressive states developing under the U.S. aegis. Israel is a leading member of it. Saudi Arabia is another, one of the most brutal, regressive, harsh states in the world; United Arab Emirates; Egypt under the harsh, brutal dictatorship; the United States; Israel. And the United States, of course, very\u2014especially under this\u2014the alignment goes way back, but the Trump administration has gone way out of its way to lend support to Israeli crimes, Israeli expansion. And the Israeli right wing, of course, which is increasingly dominant, is delighted. So, the fact that, say, the Israeli ambassador would come out and say that is really no more surprising than the fact that John Bolton would praise the election of a strong advocate of torture, murder and repression. It all fits the same pattern."

The model of the coverage, of knowing who each person was, hearing their names, their life stories, their ages, who their families were, knowing when the funerals are taking place through the week\u2014what about this being a model for what\u2019s happening in Gaza? I mean, for example, on, I think it was, Friday, six Palestinians were killed, with those ongoing protests near the separation wall. Israeli military has gunned down more than 200 Palestinians. That was Friday. Six Palestinians died. And on Sunday, three Palestinian teenagers were killed in an Israeli airstrike on the Gaza Strip. Your thoughts on Dermer trying to make this connection to get away from the issue of white supremacy and, somehow, someway, blame the left?",
    "output": "NOAMCHOMSKY:Well, remember, all of this in Gaza is being done with overwhelming U.S. support, even U.S. weapons, literally. Gaza is on the verge of becoming, literally, uninhabitable. The international monitors\u2014U.N. and others\u2014have warned that within just a few years, it may be literally unlivable. I mean, right now, there\u2019s virtually no potable water. The sewage pours into the sea, because Israel has bombed and destroyed the power plants and the sewage plant. Back in 2005, when Israel withdrew its illegal settlers in Gaza and moved them to illegal settlements in the West Bank, it imposed a siege on Gaza. The official terms for that\u2014official, not making this up\u2014are \u201cWe have to impose a diet on Gaza, not harsh enough so they\u2019ll all die\u201d\u2014implication being that wouldn\u2019t look very good\u2014\u201dbut harsh enough so that they can barely survive.\u201d And there have been\u2014quite apart from the brutal siege, there have been repeated attacks on Gaza by the Israeli army. Gaza is virtually defenseless. This is one of the strongest armies in the world, lashing out to devastate Gaza. There\u2019s always pretexts. There are pretexts for everything. Hitler had a pretext for invading Poland: He was protecting Germany from the wild terror of the Poles. And the Israelis, with U.S. backing, have concocted pretexts\u2014no time to go through it here, there\u2019s plenty in print about it. Every one of them collapses on inspection. It\u2019s just a punching bag. And the effect on the people of Gaza is to create utter desperation. The current march is just an attempt to somehow break the siege, make life possible. The problem could be overcome easily, simply by providing them with the opportunities for survival. That\u2019s it. Not trying to block every attempt at political unification of the factions. It\u2019s often been a pretext for another attack. Some of what\u2019s gone on\u2014parts of it we\u2019ve seen\u2014are just grotesque, like when a highly trained Israeli sniper murders a young woman far from the border who\u2019s trying to help\u2014a Palestinian volunteer medic, young woman, who\u2019s trying to help a wounded man, and a sniper murders her. Highly trained snipers. They know what they\u2019re doing. The international monitors who have gone through the hospitals are shocked by the kinds of wounds they\u2019re finding, purposely designed to maim people so they\u2019ll barely\u2014not kill them, but maim them, so they won\u2019t be able to have a\u2014even take part in the minimal life that exists there. Actually, Trump had a solution to this, to the misery of Gaza and the prospect that 2 million people, half of them children, will soon be in a situation of, literally, beyond the possibility of survival. They had a lifeline, what\u2019s called theUNRWAsupport, international support, which was barely keeping them alive. So, Trump\u2019s reaction is to cut it, cut support for it. And he even had a reason. He said, \u201cThey\u2019re not being grateful enough to me for my efforts to give them the ultimate deal that I\u2019m planning.\u201d Ultimate deal, which means give up all your rights and forget it. Two leading American political analysts, specialists on the Middle East, with long government service, Robert Malley, Aaron David Miller, really encapsulated the Trump program very simply, said the Trump message is to the Palestinians, \u201cYou have lost. Forget it. Go away. You\u2019re done. And because the people of Gaza are not sufficient\u2014on the West Bank\u2014or, sufficiently appreciative, let\u2019s cut the lifeline.\u201d In fact, let\u2019s even\u2014as he did\u2014cut support for underfunded Palestinian hospitals in the West Bank. Let\u2019s cut the funding for theUNRWAschool in the Shatila refugee camp in Lebanon, still reeking from the hideous Israeli-run massacre there back at the end of their invasion in \u201982. You see little kids playing in the mud in dark alleys. They\u2019ll never get out. Their children will be there, and so on. They had one hope: theUNRWAschool. Good, let\u2019s kill that. All of this, these things are, just one after another, taking place. Indescribable. I mean, the war in Yemen, which finally, at last, is getting a little bit of attention, has been a major horror story. The most careful estimates of the killing, that are now just coming out, show that there may be seven or eight times as high as what has been\u2014the numbers that have been given. They\u2019re on the order of 70,000 or 80,000. The analysis of these Saudi-Emirate programs, a long study that came out of the Fletcher School of International Diplomacy at Tufts University recently, showed, quite persuasively, that the policies of the attackers are aimed at destroying the food supplies, making sure the population starves to death. They\u2019re also trying to close the port through which some supplies come. All of this is fully backed by the United States. U.S., and Britain secondarily, supply the arms. The U.S. supplies the intelligence for the Saudi Air Force, which is carrying out massive atrocities. All of these things are happening. For years, they\u2019ve barely been discussed. Now, finally, you\u2019re seeing pictures on the front page of starving Yemeni children, even a call for a ceasefire\u2014much belated, little attention to our crucial responsibility for it. Just like our responsibility, which is overwhelming, for the plight of the miserable people trying to escape from the troika\u2014Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala\u2014the three countries that have been completely under our thumb and are suffering bitterly for it, now trying to escape. So we turn them into an invasion mob planning to destroy us. All of this is surreal. It only is overshadowed by the failure to attend even minimally to the literal existential threats, that are not remote."

For the first time in their history, they have to decide\u2014and quickly\u2014whether organized human society is going to survive for very long. And that\u2019s not in the remote distance. Again, there are two\u2014with all the problems and horrors in the world which should be attended to, there are two existential threats, both being increased. One is the threat of nuclear war, which is terminal. The other is the threat of severe environmental catastrophe, which doesn\u2019t destroy all human life, but it does undermine the prospects for organized society. And you mentioned earlier a third threat, also dating back to the end of the Second World War. The end of the Second World War was the opening of the nuclear age. And as I mentioned, it\u2019s kind of a miracle that we\u2019ve survived it. It\u2019s also the opening of what geologists are now calling the Anthropocene, the age in which human activity is radically affecting the environment. There\u2019s been debate about its origins. The World Geological Society more or less settled on the end of the beginning\u2014the end of the Second World War, the late \u201940s and on, where there was a sharp spike in damage to the environment. The third is what\u2019s called the sixth extinction, the extinction of species. The fifth extinction was around 65 million years ago, when it\u2019s assumed that a huge asteroid hit the Earth and ended the age of the dinosaurs. It destroyed most of the species on Earth. We\u2019re now in the midst of the sixth extinction, with very rapid destruction of other species and of the kind of environment in which they can survive, like wilderness, for example. We are pushing to the edge of not only our own survival, but that of much of the\u2014much of life on Earth. So, is it the most gravest moment in my life? Yes. But also in all of human history. And things like the election next week will have an impact on this. AMYGOODMAN:World-renowned professor, linguist and dissident Noam Chomsky, speaking to us from Tucson, Arizona, where he is now teaching at the University of Arizona. He is the institute professor emeritus of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he\u2019s taught for more than 50 years, has written over 100 books, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

    "output": "Right. You can get information from other sources\u2014the Internet allows you to read the foreign press if you\u2019re interested. But I think the Internet\u2019s main effect is to narrow the range of information that most people access by driving them into social media bubbles. The propaganda model is basically the same. Now, there have been other changes of various kinds. One change, of course, is just the decline of media. So, for example, I lived most of my life in Boston, andThe Boston Globe,when I was there, was a real newspaper. It had some of the best reporting in the country on, say, Central America. Today, it\u2019s not even worth subscribing to. Now it\u2019s mostly wire services. Same withThe San Francisco Chronicleand many other newspapers. There\u2019s a lot of narrowing of mainstream news sources. On the other hand, if you look at a newspaper likeThe New York Times,it has been affected significantly by the changes in the general level of consciousness and awareness. The civilizing effect of the activism of the 1960s and its aftermath has affected the journalists, the editors, content, and so on. A lot of what you read today in theTimeswould have been unimaginable a couple of decades ago. Take this morning: There\u2019s a lead story on the destruction of Gaza. VP: The shift in media coverage has been remarkable. You wouldn\u2019t have had that a couple of years ago, right? That\u2019s an effect that popular activism has had in changing the way the country understands things. Of course, there\u2019s a backlash, so you get the opposite as well. The 1619 Project got the anticipated carping from historians\u2014a footnote was wrong and so on. But it was a real breakthrough\u2014the very fact that you could look at 400 years of atrocities in a mainstream newspaper. You go back to, say, the 1960s, and that would be inconceivable. Now we\u2019re at the beginnings of facing some of this history. Today\u2019s newspaper also happens to have an important story on the Canadian atrocities against the Indigenous population, the murder of hundreds of children, maybe thousands of children in a Catholic-run residential schools from which they were essentially kidnapped and forced into these re-education schools. In the 1960s, you couldn\u2019t even talk about this. Even professional historians and major anthropologists were telling us, \u201cWell, there were just a few hunter gatherer stragglers running around the country, basically nothing was here.\u201d It\u2019s all radically changed, and that\u2019s true on issue after issue. I don\u2019t want to exaggerate it. I still would say the same kinds of critical things I\u2019ve been saying for years, but the framework has changed. Activism has created significant openings."

He wants to make sure that far-right opinions have a huge role, instead of just the major role they already have. It\u2019s straight-up Stalinist-style thought control. VP: Meanwhile, they keep concocting imaginary left-wing villains and thoughtcrimes. The striking example of this is the attack on what\u2019s called \u201ccritical race theory\u201d in the Republican states. Of course, they haven\u2019t the slightest idea what critical race theory is, but what it means to them is any discussion about things like the 1619 Project, any willingness to face the actual history of the country and the terrible legacy it left. Can\u2019t do that because it might break the dominance of white supremacy. We have to ensure that can\u2019t happen with direct efforts at censorship within schools and universities. Similarly, the right-wing digs up claims about some small school somewhere, I forget where, that indoctrinated third graders into supporting transgender rights and now it\u2019s all over the right-wing network. These types of censorship are certainly happening and are significant, but they\u2019re a counterpart to the broader efforts to cut back voting and ensure that somehow white Christian supremacy doctrines will be able to dominate regardless of their popular basis."

As you noted, there\u2019s less actual journalism today and what\u2019s left is increasingly degraded. Do you have any ideas for what a non-capitalist media system might look like?",
    "output": "I got some ideas from reading your book, so I\u2019m \u201cbringing coals to Newcastle\u201d by telling you what you wrote. But you discussed how the founders of the US Republic believed that the government ought to publicly subsidize the dissemination of diverse news media. In this light, the First Amendment should be understood as providing what\u2019s called a \u201cpositive freedom\u201d\u2014not just \u201cnegative freedom.\u201d It should create opportunities for free and independent media. Subsidizing news media was a primary function of the post office. The vast majority of post office traffic was composed of newspapers. So that\u2019s one alternative. In fact, just about every democratic country has a well-funded public media system, except the United States. Bob McChesney and your work goes through the history of how the US media system became more business-driven compared to other systems around the world. In the US, commercial interests and their allies were able to clamp down and destroy efforts in radio and television to set up more of a public media system as a counterpart to the privately owned sector, so it didn\u2019t become firmly established in the US."

    "output": "Public media subsidies are certainly one possibility within the current framework of institutions, not even changing them\u2014merely going back to the ideas we\u2019re supposed to revere, the famous framers. But there\u2019s much more. Like in the late 19th century when we had a very diverse, lively, independent labor press. It featured very interesting work, including serious commentary, analysis, and discussion by working people, many of whom had little or no formal education, but generated very striking work\u2014for example, work by the so-called factory girls\u2014the young women driven into the mills, brought from the farms. A vibrant labor press lasted in the US for a long time, even persisting into the 1950s, condemning the \u201cbought priesthood\u201d who were serving private power in the mainstream media. But it was eventually overwhelmed by capital concentration and advertiser reliance. All of that can be revived\u2014lots of possibilities for media that are freed from corporate or state control. As for public media, they can, to some degree be more free than commercial media. The measure of their freedom largely depends on the level of democracy in the broader society. If it\u2019s controlled by the state under Stalinist Russia, obviously it\u2019s not going to be free, but if it\u2019s the UK\u2019s BBC, then yes, it can be reasonably free\u2014not totally free by any means, but reasonably so."

In the popular imagination, the academy is overrun with raging leftists. But of course, we know that it\u2019s predominantly a liberal institution, with leftists a small minority. Do you have advice for radicals today who are trying to make their way through this system, trying to be effective scholar activists?",
    "output": "It\u2019s difficult because there are many barriers. The academic world is basically centrist. It\u2019s called liberal, which would mean by international standards, more or less centrist. It might be aligned with the Democratic Party, but it\u2019s not even social democratic. If you try to break out of it by being more radical, you face difficulties. They\u2019re often subtle, like just saying, \u201cThis isn\u2019t the kind of topic you want to work on,\u201d which is another of saying \u201cyou better shape up and do something else.\u201d You must face the reality of the doctrinal system and try to press the limits.

What are the signs so far of how the Biden administration intends to address the challenges to U.S. hegemony posed by its primary geopolitical rivals, namely Russia and China?",
    "output": "The challenge to U.S. hegemony posed by Russia and particularly China has been a major theme of foreign policy discourse for some time, with persistent agreement on the severity of the threat. The matter is plainly complex. It\u2019s a good rule of thumb to cast a skeptical eye when there is general agreement on some complex issue. This is no exception. What we generally find, I think, is that Russia and China sometimes deter U.S. actions to enforce its global hegemony in regions on their periphery that are of particular concern to them. One can ask whether they are justified in seeking to limit overwhelming U.S. power in this way, but that is a long distance from the way the challenge is commonly understood: as an effort to displace the U.S. global role in sustaining a liberal rule-based international order by new centers of hegemonic power."

    "input": "Do Russia and China actually challenge U.S. hegemony in the ways commonly understood?",
    "output": "Russia is not a major actor in the world scene, apart from the military force that is a (very dangerous) residue of its earlier status as a second superpower. It does not begin to compare with the U.S. in outreach and influence. China has undergone spectacular economic growth, but it is still far from approaching U.S. power in just about any dimension. It remains a relatively poor country, ranked 85th in the UN Human Development Index, between Brazil and Ecuador. The U.S., while not ranked near the top because of its poor social welfare record, is far above China. In military strength and global outreach (bases, forces in active combat), there is no comparison. U.S.-based multinationals have about half of world wealth and are first (sometimes second) in just about every category. China is far behind. China also faces serious internal problems (ecological, demographic, political). The U.S., in contrast, has internal and security advantages unmatched anywhere. Take sanctions, a major instrument of world power for one country on Earth: the U.S. They are, furthermore, third-party sanctions. Disobey them, and you\u2019re out of luck. You can be tossed out of the world financial system, or worse. It\u2019s pretty much the same wherever we look. If we look at history, we find regular echoes of Sen. Arthur Vandenberg\u2019s 1947 advice to the president that he should \u201cscare hell out of the American people\u201d if he wanted to whip them up to a frenzy of fear over the Russian threat to take over the world. It would be necessary to be \u201cclearer than truth,\u201d as explained by Dean Acheson, one of the creators of the postwar order. He was referring to NSC-68 of 1950, a founding document of the Cold War, declassified decades later. Its rhetoric continues to resound in one or another form, again today about China. NSC-68 called for a huge military build-up and imposition of discipline on our dangerously free society so that we can defend ourselves from the \u201cslave state\u201d with its \u201cimplacable purpose... to eliminate the challenge of freedom\u201d everywhere, establishing \u201ctotal power over all men [and] absolute authority over the rest of the world.\u201d And so on, in an impressive flow. China does confront U.S. power \u2014 in the South China Sea, not the Atlantic or Pacific. There is an economic challenge as well. In some areas, China is a world leader, notably renewable energy, where it is far ahead of other countries in both scale and quality. It is also the world\u2019s manufacturing base, though profits go mostly elsewhere, to managers like Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn or investors in Apple, which is increasingly reliant on intellectual property rights \u2014 the exorbitant patent rights that are a core part of the highly protectionist \u201cfree trade\u201d agreements. China\u2019s global influence is surely expanding in investment, commerce, takeover of facilities (such as management of Israel\u2019s major port). That influence is likely to expand if it moves forward with provision of vaccines virtually at cost in comparison with the West\u2019s hoarding of vaccines and its impeding of distribution of a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vaccine\u201d so as to protect corporate patents and profits. China is also advancing substantially in high technology, much to the consternation of the U.S., which is seeking to impede its development. It is rather odd to regard all of this as a challenge to U.S. hegemony. U.S. policy might help create a more serious challenge by confrontational and hostile acts that drive Russia and China closer together in reaction. That has, in fact, been happening, under Trump and in Biden\u2019s first days \u2014 though Biden did respond to Russia\u2019s call for renewing the New START Treaty on limiting nuclear weapons at the last minute, salvaging the one major element of the arms control regime that had escaped Trump\u2019s wrecking ball. Clearly what is needed is diplomacy and negotiations on contested matters, and real cooperation on such crucial issues as global warming, arms control, future pandemics \u2014 all very severe crises that know no borders. Whether Biden\u2019s hawkish foreign policy team will have the wisdom to move in these directions is, for now, at best unclear \u2014 at worst, frightening. Absent significant popular pressures, prospects do not look good. Another issue that calls for popular attention and activism is the policy of protecting hegemony by seeking to harm potential rivals, very publicly in the case of China, but elsewhere too, sometimes in ways that are sometimes hard to believe. remarkable example is buried in the Annual Report for 2020 of the Department of Health and Human Services, proudly presented by Secretary Alex Azar. Under the subheading \u201cCombatting malign influences in the Americas,\u201d the report discusses the efforts of the Department\u2019s Office of Global Affairs (OGA) to mitigate efforts by states, including Cuba, Venezuela and Russia, who are working to increase their influence in the region to the detriment of U.S. safety and security. OGA coordinated with other U.S. government agencies to strengthen diplomatic ties and offer technical and humanitarian assistance to dissuade countries in the region from accepting aid from these ill-intentioned states. Examples includeusing OGA\u2019s Health Attach\u00e9 office to persuade Brazil to reject the Russian COVID-19 vaccine, and offering CDC technical assistance in lieu of Panama accepting an offer of Cuban doctors.[Emphasis mine]. In the midst of a raging pandemic, according to this report, we must block malignant initiatives to help miserable victims. Under President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s grotesque mismanagement, Brazil has become the global horror story of failure to deal with the pandemic, despite its outstanding health institutes and fine past record in vaccination and treatment. It is suffering from a severe shortage of vaccines, so the U.S. takes pride in its efforts to prevent it from using the Russian vaccine, which Western authorities recognize to be comparable to the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines used here. Even more astonishing, as the author of this article in the EU-basedBrasil Wirecomments, is \u201cthat the US dissuaded Panama from accepting Cuban doctors, who have been on the global front line against the pandemic, working in over 40 countries.\u201d We must protect Panama from the \u201cmalign influence\u201d of the one country in the world to exhibit the kind of internationalism that is needed to save the world from disaster, a crime that must be stopped by the global hegemon. Washington\u2019s hysterical dedication to crush Cuba from almost the first days of its independence in 1959 is one of the most extraordinary phenomena of modern history, but still, the level of petty sadism is a constant surprise"

    "input": "With regards to Iran, also there do not seem to be signs of hope as the Biden administration has named Richard Nephew, an architect of sadistic sanctions against Iran under Barack Obama, as its deputy Iran envoy. Right or wrong?",
    "output": "Biden adopted Trump\u2019s Iran program with virtually no change, even in rhetoric. It is worthwhile to recall the facts. Trump withdrew U.S. participation in the JCPOA (the nuclear agreement), in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2331, which obligates all states to abide by the JCPOA, and in violation to the wishes of all other signers. In an impressive display of hegemonic power, when the UN Security Council members insisted on abiding by 2331 and not extending UN sanctions, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told them to get lost: You are renewing the sanctions. Trump imposed extremely harsh new sanctions to which others are obliged to conform, with the goal of causing maximum pain to Iranians so that perhaps the government might relent and accept his demand that the JCPOA be replaced by a new agreement that imposes much harsher restrictions on Iran. The pandemic offered new opportunities to torture Iranians by depriving them of desperately needed relief. Furthermore, it is Iran\u2019s responsibility to take the first steps towards negotiations to capitulate to the demands, by terminating actions it took in reaction to Trump\u2019s criminality. As we\u2019ve discussed before, there is merit in Trump\u2019s demand that the JCPOA can be improved. A far better solution is to establish a nuclear weapons-free zone (or WMD-free zone) in the Middle East. There is only one barrier: the U.S. will not permit it, and vetoes the proposal when it arises in international forums, most recently seen by President Obama. The reason is well-understood: It\u2019s necessary to protect Israel\u2019s major nuclear arsenal from inspection. The U.S. does not even formally acknowledge its existence. To do so would prejudice the vast flood of U.S. aid to Israel, arguably in violation of U.S. law, a door that neither political party wants to open. It\u2019s another topic that will not even be discussed unless popular pressure makes suppression impossible. In U.S. discourse, Trump is criticized because his policy of torturing Iranians didn\u2019t succeed in bringing the government to capitulate. The stance is reminiscent of Obama\u2019s highly praised moves towards limited relations with Cuba, because, as he explained, we need new tactics after our efforts to bring democracy to Cuba had failed \u2014 namely, a vicious terrorist war that led almost to extinction in the 1962 missile crisis and sanctions of unparalleled cruelty that are unanimously condemned by the UN General Assembly (Israel excepted). Similarly, our wars in Indochina, the worst crimes since World War II, are criticized as a \u201cfailure,\u201d as is the invasion of Iraq, a textbook example of the \u201csupreme international crime\u201d for which Nazi war criminals were hanged. These are among the prerogatives of a true hegemon, immune to the cackles of foreigners and confident in the support of those whom an acerbic critic once called \u201cthe herd of independent minds,\u201d the bulk of the educated classes and the political class. Biden took over the entire Trump program, without any change. And to twist the knife further, he appointed Richard Nephew as deputy Iran envoy. Nephew has explained his views in his bookArt of Sanctions, where he outlines the proper \u201cstrategy to carefully, methodically, and efficiently increase pain on areas that are vulnerabilities while avoiding those that are not.\u201d Just the right choice for the policy of torturing Iranians because the government that most of them despise will not bend to Washington\u2019s demands. U.S. government policy towards Cuba and Iran provides very valuable insight into how the world works under the domination of imperial power. Cuba since independence in 1959 has been the target of unremitting U.S. violence and torture, reaching truly sadistic levels \u2014 with scarcely a word of protest in elite sectors. The U.S., fortunately, is an unusually free country, so we have access to declassified records explaining the ferocity of the efforts to punish Cubans. Fidel Castro\u2019s crime, the State Department explained in the early years, is its \u201csuccessful defiance\u201d of U.S. policy since the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which declared Washington\u2019s right to control the hemisphere. Plainly harsh measures are required to stifle such efforts, as any Mafia Don would understand \u2014 and the analogy of world order to the Mafia has considerable merit. Much the same is true of Iran since 1979, when a popular uprising overthrew the tyrant installed by the U.S. in a military coup that rid the country of its parliamentary regime. Israel had enjoyed very close relations with Iran during the years of the Shah\u2019s tyranny and extreme human rights violations, and like the U.S., was appalled by his overthrow. Israel\u2019s de facto Ambassador to Iran, Uri Lubrani, expressed his \u201cstrong\u201d belief that the uprising could be suppressed, and the Shah restored \u201cby a very relatively small force, determined, ruthless, cruel. I mean the men who would lead that force will have to be emotionally geared to the possibility that they would have to kill ten thousand people.\u201d U.S. authorities pretty much agreed. President Carter sent NATO Gen. Robert E. Huyser to Iran to try to convince the Iranian military to undertake the task \u2014 a surmise confirmed by recently released internal documents. They refused, considering it hopeless. Shortly after, Saddam Hussein invaded Iran \u2014 an attack that killed hundreds of thousands of Iranians, with full support from the Reagan administration, even when Saddam resorted to chemical weapons, first against Iranians, then against Iraqi Kurds in the Halabja atrocities. Reagan protected his friend Hussein by attributing the crimes to Iran and blocking congressional censure. He then turned to direct military support for Hussein with naval forces in the Gulf. One vessel, theUSS Vincennes, shot down an Iranian civilian airliner in a clearly marked commercial airspace, killing 290 people, returning to a royal welcome at its home base where the commander and flight officer who had directed the destruction of the airliner were rewarded with Medals of Honor. Recognizing that it could not fight the U.S., Iran effectively capitulated. Washington then to turned harsh sanctions against Iran, while rewarding Hussein in ways that sharply increased threats to Iran, which was then just emerging from a devastating war. President Bush I invited Iraqi nuclear engineers to the U.S. for advanced training in nuclear weapons production, no small matter for Iran. He pushed through agricultural aid that Hussein badly needed after having destroyed rich agricultural areas with his chemical weapons attack against Iraqi Kurds. He sent a high-level mission to Iraq headed by the Republican Senate leader Bob Dole, later presidential candidate, to deliver his respects to Hussein, to assure him that critical comment about him would be curbed onVoice of America, and to advise Hussein that he should ignore critical comment in the press, which the U.S. government can\u2019t prevent. This was April 1990. A few months later, Hussein disobeyed (or misunderstood) orders and invaded Kuwait. Then everything changed. Almost everything. Punishment of Iran for its \u201csuccessful defiance\u201d continued, with harsh sanctions, and new initiatives by President Bill Clinton, who issued executive orders and signed congressional legislation sanctioning investment in Iran\u2019s oil sector, the basis of its economy. Europe objected, but had no way to avoid U.S. extraterritorial sanctions. U.S. firms suffered too. Princeton University Middle East specialist Seyed Hossein Mousavian, former spokesman for Iran nuclear negotiators, reports that Iran had offered a billion-dollar contract to the U.S. energy firm Conoco. Clinton\u2019s intervention, blocking the deal, closed off an opportunity for reconciliation, one of many cases that Mousavian reviews. Clinton\u2019s action was part of a general pattern, an unusual one. Ordinarily, particularly on energy-related issues, policy conforms to Adam Smith\u2019s comments on 18th-century England, where the \u201cmasters of mankind\u201d who own the private economy are the \u201cprincipal architects\u201d of government policy, and act to ensure that their own interests are foremost, however \u201cgrievous\u201d the effect on others, including the people of England. Exceptions are rare, and instructive. Two striking exceptions are Cuba and Iran. Major business interests (pharmaceuticals, energy, agribusiness, aircraft, and others) have been eager to break into Cuban and Iranian markets and to establish relations with domestic enterprises. State power bars any such moves, overruling parochial interests of the \u201cmasters of mankind\u201d in favor of the transcendent goal of punishing successful defiance. There\u2019s a good deal to say about these exceptions to the rule, but it would take us too far afield."

    "output": "For reasons of cost alone, it is a goal that should be high on the agenda of anyone who wants to see the kinds of domestic programs the country badly needs. But the reasons go far beyond. Current nuclear strategy calls for preparation for war \u2014 meaning terminal nuclear war \u2014 with China and Russia. We should also remember an observation of Daniel Ellsberg\u2019s: Nuclear weapons are constantly used, much in the way a gun is used by a robber who aims his gun at a storekeeper and says, \u201cYour money or your life.\u201d The principle in fact is enshrined in policy, in the important 1995 document \u201cEssentials of Post-Cold War Deterrence\u201d issued by Clinton\u2019s Strategic Command (STRATCOM). The study concludes that nuclear weapons are indispensable because of their incomparable destructive power, but even if not used, \u201cnuclear weapons always cast a shadow over any crisis or conflict,\u201d enabling us to gain our ends through intimidation; Ellsberg\u2019s point. The study goes on to authorize \u201cpreemptive\u201d use of nuclear weapons and provides advice for planners, who should not \u201cportray ourselves as too fully rational and cool-headed.\u201d Rather, the \u201cnational persona we project\u201d should be \u201cthat the US may become irrational and vindictive if its vital interests are attacked and that \u201csome elements may appear to be potentially \u2018out of control.\u2019\u201d Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cmadman theory,\u201d but this time not from reports by associates but from the designers of nuclear strategy. Two months ago, the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons went into effect. The nuclear powers refused to sign, and still violate their legal responsibility under the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to undertake \u201ceffective measures\u201d to eliminate nuclear weapons. That stance is not carved in stone, and popular activism could induce significant moves in that direction, a necessity for survival. Regrettably, that level of civilization still seems beyond the range of the most powerful states, which are careening in the opposite direction, upgrading and enhancing the means to terminate organized human life on Earth. Even junior partners are joining in the race to destruction. Just a few days ago, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson \u201cannounced a 40 per cent increase in UK\u2019s stockpile of nuclear warheads. His review... recognised \u2018the evolving security environment\u2019, identifying Russia as Britain\u2019s `most acute threat\u2019.\u201d Lots of work to do.

No doubt, we need internationalism in the fight against climate breakdown because, as you have so aptly put it yourself, it is either \u201cextinction or internationalism.\u201d My question to you is twofold: Firstly, how do you understand \u201cinternationalism\u201d in the current historical juncture where, in spite of all of the globalizing processes under way in the course of the past 40 or 50 years, the nation-state remains the central agency? And, secondly, what system changes are required to give \u201cinternationalism\u201d a real fighting chance in the war against the apocalyptic consequences of global warming which are already knocking at humanity\u2019s door?",
    "output": "There are many forms of internationalism. It\u2019s worthwhile to think about them. They carry lessons. One form of internationalism is the specific kind of \u201cglobalization\u201d that has been imposed during the neoliberal years through a series of investor-rights agreements masquerading as free trade. It constitutes a form of class war. Another form of internationalism is the Axis alliance that brought us World War II. A pale reflection is Trump\u2019s sole geostrategic program: construction of an alliance of reactionary states run from Washington, including as one core component the Middle East Abraham Accords and its side agreements with the Egyptian and Saudi dictatorships, taken over by Biden. Still another form of internationalism has been championed on occasion by workers\u2019 movements, in the U.S. by the \u201cWobblies,\u201d the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Other unions, too, have the term \u201cinternational\u201d in their names, a relic of commitment to true internationalism. In Europe, the most eloquent spokesperson for this form of internationalism was Rosa Luxemburg. The conflict between internationalism and chauvinism came to a head with the outbreak of World War I. Chauvinism conquered. The Socialist International collapsed. In Luxemburg\u2019s acidic words, the slogan, \u201cProletarians of all countries united\u201d was abandoned in favor of \u201cProletarians of all countries cut each other\u2019s throat.\u201d Luxemburg held true to the internationalist vision, a rare stance. In all countries, intellectuals across the political spectrum rallied enthusiastically to the chauvinist cause. Those who did not were likely to find their way to prison, like Luxemburg: Karl Liebknecht, Bertrand Russell, Eugene Debs. The IWW was crushed by state-capital violence. Turning to the present, we find other manifestations of internationalism. When the COVID pandemic broke out in early 2020, the rich countries of central Europe at first managed to get it more or less under control, a success that collapsed when Europeans chose not to forego their summer vacations. While Germany and Austria were still in fairly good shape in early 2020, there was, however, a severe pandemic in northern Italy a few miles to their south, within the Europe Union. Italy did benefit from true internationalism \u2014 not on the part of its rich neighbors. Rather, from the world\u2019s one country with internationalist commitments: Cuba, which sent doctors to help, as it did elsewhere, extending a record that goes far back. Among others, Panama received assistance from Cuba, but the U.S. took care of that. In its final 2020 report, Trump\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services proudly announced that it had successfully pressured Panama to expel Cuban doctors to protect the hemisphere from Cuba\u2019s \u201cmalign\u201d influence. The malign influence, spelled out in the early days of Cuban independence in 1959, was that Cuba might infect Latin America with its \u201csuccessful defiance\u201d of U.S. policies since the Monroe Doctrine of 1823. To prevent this threat, the U.S. launched a major campaign of terror and economic strangulation, following the logic spelled out at the State Department in 1960 by Lester Mallory. He recognized, as U.S. intelligence knew, that the \u201cmajority of Cubans support Castro,\u201d and that the \u201conly foreseeable means of alienating internal support is through disenchantment and disaffection based on economic dissatisfaction and hardship.\u201d Therefore, \u201cit follows that every possible means should be undertaken promptly to weaken the economic life of Cuba ... to bring about hunger, desperation and overthrow of government.\u201d The policy has been rigorously followed with bipartisan fervor in the face of unanimous world opposition (Israel excepted). The days of \u201cdecent respect for the opinions of mankind\u201d have long faded to oblivion, along with such frivolities as the UN Charter and the rule of law. It is astonishing that Cuba has survived the relentless assault. The successes of the policy of strangulation and torture are reported with no little exuberance, an unusual exhibition of sadistic cowardice. Among the many popular protests underway in Latin America, one is front page news: in Cuba, giving Biden an opportunity to slap even more sanctions on the \u201cvillain\u201d for its resort to abusive measures to suppress the demonstrations, which appear to be mostly about \u201ceconomic dissatisfaction and hardship,\u201d and failures of the authoritarian government to respond in timely and effective fashion. Cuba\u2019s unique internationalism is also undermined, freeing the world from any departure from the norm of self-interest, rarely breached in more than the most limited ways. That must change. It is by now broadly understood that hoarding of vaccines by the rich countries is not only morally obscene but also self-destructive. The virus will mutate in countries with nondominant economies, and among those refusing vaccination in the rich countries, posing severe dangers to everyone on Earth, the rich included. Much more seriously, heating of the planet also knows no borders. There will be nowhere to hide for long. The same is true of the growing threat of nuclear war among major powers: the end. Rosa Luxemburg and the Wobblies sketched the kinds of \u201csystem changes\u201d toward which humanity should strive, in one or another way. Short of the goals they envisioned, steps must be taken toward engaging an informed and concerned public in international institutions of solidarity and mutual aid, eroding borders, recognizing our shared fate, committing ourselves to working together for the common good instead of \u201ccutting each other\u2019s throats.\u201d"

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: Noam, in 2016 Trump called U.S foreign policy \u201ca complete and total disaster,\u201d claiming that previous administrations in the post-Cold War era were guided by unrealistic expectations that damaged America\u2019s national interests. Since taking office, he has withdrawn the country from a series of international agreements, demanding that countries pay for U.S. protection, and seeking to advance U.S economic interests through tariffs and protectionism. These moves have led many analysts to speak of a new era in U.S. relations with the world. What\u2019s your own take on Trump\u2019s foreign policy?",
    "output": "One of the most appropriate comments I\u2019ve seen on Trump\u2019s foreign policy appeared in an article inThe New Republicwritten by David Roth, the editor of a sports blog: \u201cThe spectacle of expert analysts and thought leaders parsing the actions of a man with no expertise or capacity for analysis is the purest acid satire \u2014 but less because of how badly that expert analysis has failed than because of how sincerely misplaced it is ... there is nothing here to parse, no hidden meanings or tactical elisions or slow-rolled strategic campaign.\u201d That seems generally accurate. This is a man, after all, who dismisses the information and analyses of his massive intelligence system in favor of what was said this morning on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d where everyone tells him how much they love him. With all due skepticism about the quality of intelligence, this is sheer madness considering the stakes. And it continues, in ways that are almost surreal. At the recent G20 conference, Trump was asked about Putin\u2019s statement that Western liberalism is obsolete. Trump assumed he must be talking about California:Westernliberalism. Putin \u201cmay feel that way,\u201d Trump responded: \u201cHe sees what\u2019s going on. And I guess, if you look at what\u2019s happening in Los Angeles, where it\u2019s so sad to look; and what\u2019s happening in San Francisco and a couple of other cities which are run by an extraordinary group of liberal people.\u201d He was asked why the U.S. alone is refusing to join the G20 in a commitment to address global warming and responded by praising the quality of U.S. air and water, apparently not understanding the distinction. It\u2019s hard to find a comment on foreign policy that departs from this impressive norm. Efforts to detect some coherent global strategy indeed seem to be a kind of acid satire. Not that there is no coherent policy. There is one policy that emerges from the chaos \u2014 the kind we would expect from an egotistical con man who has one principle: Me! It follows that any treaty or agreement reached by predecessors (particularly the despised Obama) is the worst deal in history, which will be replaced by the Greatest Deal in History negotiated by the most accomplished deal-maker of all time and greatest American president. Similarly, any other action carried out in the past was misguided and harmed America, but will be corrected by the \u201cstable genius\u201d now in charge of defending America from those who are cheating and assaulting it on all sides. It makes no difference what the consequences are \u2014 terrible, decent, indifferent \u2014 as long as the imagery is preserved. It may be recalled that a president who obtains his picture of the world from \u201cFox and Friends\u201d is not an entirely new phenomenon. Forty years ago, a revered predecessor (Ronald Reagan) was learning about the world from movies, and was so mesmerized that he even came to believe that he had taken part in the liberation of Nazi concentration camps (while not leaving California). All of this tells us something about modern politics. But Trump can\u2019t be compared to Reagan, any more than farce can be compared to tragedy, to paraphrase Marx. It\u2019s understandable that the farce elicits ridicule, and no doubt some are relishing the coming photo-op of Trump and Boris Johnson upholding Anglo-American civilization. But for the world, it\u2019s dead serious, from the destruction of the environment and the growing threats of terminal nuclear war to a long list of other crimes and horrors. The most dangerous immediate foreign policy crisis is the conflict with Iran, which has been deemed the official source of all evil. Iran must end its \u201caggression\u201d and become a \u201cnormal country\u201d \u2014 like Saudi Arabia, which is making rapid progress in Trump\u2019s fantasy world, even \u201ca great job in Saudi Arabia from the standpoint of women,\u201d he explained at G20. The charges against Iran resonate through the media echo chamber with little effort to assess the validity of the accusations \u2014 which hardly withstand analysis. Whatever one thinks of Iranian international behavior, by the miserable standards of U.S. allies in the region \u2014 not to speak of the U.S. itself \u2014 it is not much of a competitor in the rogue state derby. In the real world, the U.S. unilaterally decided to destroy the well-functioning nuclear agreement (JCPOA), with ludicrous charges accepted by virtually no one with the slightest credibility, and to impose extremely harsh sanctions designed to punish the Iranian people and undermine the economy. The [U.S. government] also uses its enormous economic power, including virtual control of the international financial system, to compel others to obey Washington\u2019s dictates. None of this has even minimal legitimacy; the same is true of Cuba and other cases. The world may protest \u2014 last November, the UN General Assembly once again condemned the U.S. embargo on Cuba, 189-2 (only the U.S. and Israel voted against the resolution). But in vain. The weird idea of the founders that one might have \u201cdecent respect to the opinions of mankind\u201d has long vanished, and the pained bleatings of the world pass in silence. On Iran as well. This is not the place to pursue the matter, but there is a good deal more to say about the U.S. specialty of resorting to sanctions (with extraterritorial reach) to punish populations \u2014 a form of \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d that finds its place within what Nick Turse calls \u201cthe American system of suffering\u201d in his harrowing expose of the U.S. assault on the civilian population of South Vietnam. The right to engage in this malicious practice is accepted as normal in the U.S. doctrinal system, with little effort to analyze the actual motives in individual cases, the legitimacy of such policies, or in fact even their legality. Matters of no slight significance. With regard to Iran, within the government-media doctrinal system, the only question that arises is whether the victim will respond in some way, maybe by \u201cviolating\u201d the agreement that the U.S. has demolished, maybe by some other act. And if it does, it obviously will be deemed to deserve brutal punishment. In commentary made by U.S. officials and media, Iran \u201cviolates\u201d agreements. The U.S. merely \u201cwithdraws\u201d from them. The stance is reminiscent of a comment by the great anarchist writer and Wobbly activist T-Bone Slim: \u201cOnly the poor break laws \u2014 the rich evade them.\u201d Analysts have tried hard to detect some grand strategy behind the U.S. assault on Iran, another exercise in futility. It\u2019s easy enough to detect the goals of the thugs surrounding Trump: for Pompeo and Bolton, the goal is to smash the miscreant \u2014 from a safe distance, so that it isn\u2019t costly for us. And damn the consequences. Trump himself seems to see it quite differently. Whether he in fact called off a military strike because of his compassion for 150 possible victims, who knows? The only evidence comes from a source that is not famous for its credibility. But it seems clear that he doesn\u2019t want a war, which would spoil all the fun and games that he is so greatly enjoying, and would harm his electoral prospects. It\u2019s far better to go into the elections facing the cosmic threat of an evil enemy that only the Bold and Courageous Leader is able to confront, not any of those weak-kneed Dems, surely none of those \u201cmere\u201d women. Reagan grasped the principle as well when he boldly faced the threat of Nicaragua, strapping on his cowboy boots and warning that Nicaraguan troops were only two days\u2019 march from Harlingen, Texas, and declaring a national emergency because of the extraordinary threat to the security and survival of the U.S. This is not the place to pursue the matter again, but in the background of the Iran conflict are some unmentionable facts. The alleged threat of Iranian nuclear weapons can readily be overcome by adopting the demand of the Arab States, Iran, and in fact virtually the entire world, to establish a nuclear weapons-free zone in the region, a policy to which the U.S. and UK have a unique obligation, and which the U.S. regularly blocks \u2014 for reasons that are hardly obscure: If the U.S. were to officially acknowledge the existence of Israel\u2019s nuclear arsenal, the huge flood of aid to Israel would be illegal under U.S. law, and of course, Israel\u2019s weapons of mass destruction cannot be subject to inspection. What about tariffs? \u201cTariff man\u201d tells us that the tariffs are designed to promote U.S. economic interests, but whether he believes it or not, or cares, we have no idea. Political pronouncements can rarely be taken at face value, and Trump is not notorious for his truthfulness and credibility. There is, to put it charitably, scant evidence for Trump\u2019s boast that his tariffs are forcing China to pour \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d into the Treasury Department. \u201cWe never had 10 cents coming into our Treasury\u201d under past administrations, he explained. \u201cNow we have billions coming in.\u201d In the real world, the costs of the tariffs are borne by U.S. companies (which may choose to compensate by reducing wages) and consumers, burdened with a highly regressive tax that targets mostly less affluent. In brief, Trump\u2019s tariffs are yet another one of his policies to harm American workers and the poor. It is, however, true that \u201cbillions\u201d are involved. A study by the New York Fed with Princeton and Columbia Universities estimates that U.S. companies and consumers have paid $3 billion a month in additional taxes because of tariffs on Chinese goods and on aluminum and steel from around the globe, in addition to a $1.4 billion in costs to U.S. companies related to lost efficiency in 2018. The tariff war against China may lead to some shifting of assembly operations from China to Vietnam and other countries with even lower labor costs, but as for the U.S. economy, more typical is the decision of Apple a few days ago to shift Mac Pro computer assembly from Texas to China. Trump\u2019s tariff wars seem to relate primarily to domestic policy, crafted with the coming election in view. He has to somehow convince his voting base that he is the one man in the country protecting battered Americans who are suffering from the \u201ccarnage\u201d created by his predecessors \u2014 which is real enough for a great many Americans, as illustrated dramatically by the astonishing decline in life expectancy among white working age Americans, attributed to \u201cdeaths of despair,\u201d a phenomenon unknown in developed societies. Trump\u2019s trick is to wave a big club and threaten others with dire consequences unless they stop torturing poor America and agree to \u201cplay fair.\u201d When we take all this apart, a different picture emerges, much as in the case of the ominous threat of Iran. But what matters for the con game is the \u201calternative reality\u201d that the conjurers are concocting. With no little success. It\u2019s a mistake to \u201cmis-underestimate\u201d Trump (to borrow W. Bush\u2019s neologism). He is a canny demagogue and manipulator, who is managing to maintain the allegiance of the adoring crowds that believe he is standing up for them against the hated elites while also ensuring that the primary Republican constituency of extreme wealth and corporate power are doing just fine, despite some complaints. And they surely are, in fact, making out like bandits with help from Trump and his associates. It is quite remarkable to see how effectively alternative reality is created. Iran is typical, but the successes are far broader. Consider the charge that \u201cChina is killing us,\u201d stealing our jobs, joined by \u201cMexican robbers.\u201d How is China killing us? Did China have a gun to the head of CEO Tim Cook of Apple, ordering him to end the last vestige of production of Apple computers in the U.S.? Or Boeing, or GM, or Microsoft, or any of the others who have shifted production to China? Or were the decisions made by bankers and investors in corporate boardrooms in New York and Chicago? And if the latter, is the solution to wave a fist at China or to change the mode of decision-making in the U.S. \u2014 by shifting it to the hands of stakeholders, workers and communities, or at least giving them a substantial role, as democratic theory would suggest? It seems a fairly obvious question. Oddly, it isn\u2019t raised, while the official mantra persists unperturbed. It\u2019s claimed that China imposes unfair conditions on investors, demanding technology transfer (following the pattern of development of others from England and the U.S. to the East Asian tigers). Perhaps so. If Apple and others don\u2019t like these conditions, they\u2019re free not to invest in China. Worshippers of free enterprise and the market should surely agree."

    "input": "Another charge is that China is unfairly pursuing an industrial policy that subsidizes favored industries. If so, U.S. political leaders and analysts should be cheering. According to the economic doctrines they profess, China is harming its economy by departing from the optimal free market mode of development, thus contributing to U.S. economic hegemony. What\u2019s the problem?",
    "output": "Somehow, that\u2019s not what we hear. Nor do we hear much about how this is normal policy in Western state capitalist societies, notoriously in the U.S. throughout its history, and dramatically since World War II, the basis for the creation of today\u2019s high-tech economy, and continuing today. What appears to be a more credible charge is that China is violating the intellectual property rights regime (TRIPS) established in the World Trade Organization. Suppose so. Several questions arise. One is: who gains, who loses? To a large extent, American consumers gain, while Big Pharma, Microsoft, and others granted exorbitant and unprecedented patent rights under TRIPS suffer some reduction in their enormous profits. That leads at once to another question: Is the TRIPS regime legitimate? True, it was established by interstate agreement, but who made those decisions? Did the public have any role, or even know what was happening? Hardly. The misnamed \u201cfree trade agreements\u201d are more properly described as investor-rights agreements, often with little relation to trade in any meaningful sense, and not surprisingly, serving the interests of their designers in the investor class. Other elements of the \u201cChina is killing us\u201d complaints actually make sense. Concern is often openly expressed that Chinese progress might leave the U.S. behind \u2014 for example, that Huawei\u2019s cheaper and superior technology may give them an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d in establishing 5G networks. Plainly that has to be stopped, U.S. officials argue, along with Chinese economic development generally. Their concerns are reminiscent of the 1980s, when superior Japanese manufacturing techniques were undermining inefficient U.S. enterprises, and the Reagan administration had to intervene to block Japanese imports by \u201cvoluntary export restraints\u201d \u2014 where \u201cvoluntary\u201d means \u201cagree or else\u201d \u2014 and other devices to enable backward American management to catch up. Without proceeding, while there are some detectable strategic objectives, much of what is offered and discussed is concealing something quite different. And there is good reason to agree that the sight of experts seeking to detect some grand strategy behind Trump\u2019s antics is \u201cthe purest acid satire.\u201d But there is a strategy. And it is working quite well. One of Trump\u2019s stated objectives behind his understanding of diplomacy is to \u201cturn enemies into friends.\u201d Is there any evidence that he is actually pursuing such a diplomatic objective? I have in mind, in particular, the cases of North Korea and Russia. In this case, the stated objective seems real. It elicits ridicule and bitter condemnation across the mainstream political spectrum. But whatever Trump\u2019s motives may be, the general policy makes some sense. The Panmunjom Declaration of the two Koreas in April 2018 was a highly significant event. It called for the two Koreas to proceed toward amicable relations and eventual denuclearization \u201con their own accord,\u201d without the external interference that has often in the past undermined what seemed to be initiatives with some promise: repeated interference from the U.S., as the historical record shows, facts commonly evaded in reporting. In this Declaration and related agreements, as discussed by Korea specialist Chung-in Moon in the main establishment journalForeign Affairs, for the first time the two Koreas laid out specific timetables and took concrete and promising steps toward reduction of tensions and disarmament \u2014 developments that should be welcomed and supported. To his credit, Trump has largely adhered to the request of the two Koreas. His recent meeting with Kim at the demilitarized zone, the symbolic border crossing, and possible tentative agreements are steps that with goodwill could have salutary consequences. They might facilitate efforts of the two Koreas to proceed on the difficult path toward accommodation and might offer a way to relieve the sanctions that are blocking badly needed aid to the North and contributing to a major humanitarian crisis there. All of this may infuriate commentators across the spectrum, but if there is a better way to bring peace to the peninsula and to take steps toward denuclearization and reform within the North Korean dictatorship, no one has yet informed us about it. Putin\u2019s Russia need not be turned into a \u201cfriend,\u201d but cooperative relations with Russia are a prerequisite for survival. Trump\u2019s record on this score is mixed. Mattis\u2019s Nuclear Posture Review (February 2018) poses very severe threats, escalated since by the unbelievable decision to carry forward development of hypersonic weapons. Adversaries are doing likewise. The right approach is diplomacy and negotiations to prevent a suicidal course, but there is not a hint of that. The same is true of the INF Treaty negotiated by Reagan and Gorbachev, which significantly reduced the risks of terminal war. Each side claims that the other is violating the treaty. The right approach is to have neutral analysts investigate the claims and to negotiate an end to such violations as are discovered. The worst approach is to withdraw from the treaty, as the U.S. is doing, with Russia following. The same considerations hold for the other major arms control treaty, New Start. Throughout, it seems that John Bolton, consistent in his malevolence, has succeeded in blocking progress and driving policy in directions that are extremely ominous."

    "output": "I presume that Kushner is the main architect, as reported. What has been released so far is fairly straightforward, and consistent with earlier policies of the administration authorizing Israel\u2019s takeover of the Golan Heights and development of Greater Jerusalem, all in violation of Security Council orders (backed at the time by the U.S.). At the same time, the meager U.S. aid to Palestinians has been terminated on the grounds that they do not thank the boss politely enough when he is undermining their most elementary rights. The Kushner plan carries this forward. Israel is to be granted the fondest wishes of its expansionist leadership. The Palestinians are to be bought off by development funds provided by others (not the U.S.). The essence of the Trump-Kushner \u201cDeal of the Century\u201d was captured succinctly by Israeli UN Ambassador Danny Danon, inThe New York Times: Palestinians should realize that the game is over and \u201csurrender.\u201d Then there can be peace, another triumph of the \u201cgreat negotiator.\u201d In this case there is an underlying strategic objective: to consolidate the alliance of reactionary states (the oil monarchies, Egypt, Israel) as a base for U.S. power in the region. That is by no means something new, though earlier variants had somewhat different forms and were less visible than today. These objectives fall within a broader strategy of forming a global reactionary alliance under the U.S. aegis, including the \u201cilliberal democracies\u201d of Eastern Europe (Hungary\u2019s Orb\u00e1n, etc.) and Brazil\u2019s grotesque Jair Bolsonaro, who among other virtues, shares with Trump the dedication to undermine prospects for a livable environment by opening up the Amazon \u2014 \u201cthe lungs of the earth\u201d \u2014 to exploitation by his friends in mining and agribusiness. That\u2019s a natural strategy for today\u2019s Trump-McConnell Republican party, well ensconced to the far right of the international spectrum, even beyond the European \u201cpopulist\u201d parties that were not long ago considered a contemptible fringe."

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: Noam, the war in Ukraine is causing unimaginable human suffering, but it is also having global economic consequences and is terrible news for the fight against global warming. Indeed, as a result of rising energy costs and concerns about energy security, decarbonization efforts have taken a back seat. In the U.S., the Biden administration has embraced the Republican slogan \u201cdrill, baby, drill,\u201d Europe is set on building new gas pipelines and import facilities, and China plans to boost coal production capacity. Can you comment on the implications of these unfortunate developments and explain why short-term thinking continues to prevail among world leaders even at a time when humanity could be on the brink of an existential threat?",
    "output": "The last question is not new. In one or another form, it has arisen throughout history. Take one case that has been extensively studied: Why did political leaders go to war in 1914, supremely confident of their own righteousness? And why did the most prominent intellectuals in every warring country line up with passionate enthusiasm in support of their own state \u2014 apart from a handful of dissidents, the most prominent of whom were jailed (Bertrand Russell, Eugene Debs, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht)? It wasn\u2019t a terminal crisis, but it was serious enough. The pattern goes far back in history. And it continues with little change after August 6, 1945, when we learned that human intelligence had risen to the level where it soon would be able to exterminate everything. Observing the pattern closely, over the years, a basic conclusion seems to me to emerge clearly: Whatever is driving policy, it is not security \u2014 at least, security of the population. That is at best a marginal concern. That holds for existential threats as well. We have to look elsewhere. good starting point, I think, is what seems to me to be the best-established principle of international relations theory: Adam Smith\u2019s observation that the \u201cMasters of Mankind\u201d \u2014 in his day the merchants and manufacturers of England \u2014 are the \u201cprincipal architects of [state] policy.\u201d They use their power to ensure that their own interests \u201care most peculiarly attended to\u201d no matter how \u201cgrievous\u201d the effects on others, including the people of England, but most brutally the victims of the \u201csavage injustice of the Europeans.\u201d His particular target was British savagery in India, then in its early stages, already horrifying enough. Nothing much changes when the crises become existential. Short-term interests prevail. The logic is clear in competitive systems, like unregulated markets. Those who do not play the game are soon out of it. Competition among the \u201cprincipal architects of policy\u201d in the state system has somewhat similar properties, but we should bear in mind that security of the population is far from a guiding principle, as the record shows all too clearly. You are quite right about the horrific impact of the criminal Russian invasion of Ukraine. Discussion in the U.S. and Europe focuses on the suffering in Ukraine itself, quite reasonably, while also applauding our policy of accelerating the misery, not so reasonably. I\u2019ll return to that. The policy of escalating the war in Ukraine, instead of trying to take steps to end it, has a horrific impact far beyond Ukraine. As widely reported, Ukraine and Russia are major food exporters. The war has cut off food supplies to populations in desperate need, particularly in Africa and Asia. Take just one example, the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis according to the UN: Yemen. Over 2 million children face imminent starvation, the World Food Program reports. Almost 100 percent of cereal is imported \u201cwith Russia and Ukraine accounting for the largest share of wheat and wheat products (42%),\u201d in addition to re-exported flour and processed wheat from the same region. The crisis extends far beyond. Let\u2019s try to be honest about it: Perpetuation of the war is, simply, a program of mass murder throughout much of the Global South. That\u2019s the least of it. There are discussions in purportedly serious journals about how the U.S. can win a nuclear war with Russia. Such discussions verge on criminal insanity. And, unfortunately, US-NATO policies provide many possible scenarios for quick termination of human society. To take just one, Putin has so far refrained from attacking the supply lines sending heavy weapons to Ukraine. It won\u2019t be a great surprise if that restraint ends, bringing Russia and NATO close to direct conflict, with an easy path to tit-for-tat escalation that could well lead to a quick goodbye. More likely, in fact highly probable, is slower death through poisoning of the planet. The most recent IPCC report made it crystal clear that if there is to be any hope for a livable world, we must stop using fossil fuels right now, proceeding steadily until they are soon eliminated. As you point out, the effect of the ongoing war is to end the far-too-limited initiatives underway, indeed to reverse them and to accelerate the race to suicide. There is, naturally, great joy in the executive offices of the corporations dedicated to destroying human life on Earth. Now they are not only freed from constraints and from the carping of annoying environmentalists, but they are lauded for saving the civilization that they are now encouraged to destroy even more expeditiously. Arms producers share their euphoria about the opportunities offered by the continuing conflict. They are now encouraged to waste scarce resources that are desperately needed for humane and constructive purposes. And like their partners in mass destruction, the fossil fuel corporations, they are raking in taxpayer dollars. What could be better, or from a different perspective, more insane? We would do well to recall President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s words in his \u201cCross of Iron\u201d speech in 1953: Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.... This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron. These words could hardly be more appropriate today. Let\u2019s return to why \u201cworld leaders\u201d pursue this mad course. First, let\u2019s see if we can find any who deserve the appellation, except in irony. If there were any, they would be devoting themselves to bringing the conflict to an end in the only way possible: by diplomacy and statecraft. The general outlines of a political settlement have long been understood. We have discussed them before and have also documented the dedication of the U.S. (with NATO in tow) to undermine the possibility of a diplomatic settlement, quite openly, and with pride. There should be no need to review the dismal record again. common refrain is that \u201cMad Vlad\u201d is so insane, and so immersed in wild dreams of reconstructing an empire and maybe conquering the world, that there\u2019s no point even listening to what Russians are saying \u2014 that is, if you can evade U.S. censorship and find some snippets on Indian state TV or Middle East media. And there is surely no need to contemplate diplomatic engagement with such a creature. Therefore, let\u2019s not even explore the only possibility for ending the horror and just continue to escalate it, no matter what the consequences for Ukrainians and the world. Western leaders, and much of the political class, are now consumed with two major ideas: The first is that Russian military force is so overwhelming that it may soon seek to conquer Western Europe, or even beyond. Thus, we have to \u201cfight Russia over there\u201d (with Ukrainian bodies) so that \u201cwe don\u2019t have to fight Russia here\u201d in Washington, D.C., or so we are warned by House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff, a Democrat. The second is that Russian military force has been shown to be a paper tiger, so incompetent and frail, and so poorly led, that it can\u2019t conquer cities a few kilometers from its border defended largely by a citizens\u2019 army. The latter thought is the object of much gloating. The former inspires terror in our hearts. Orwell defined \u201cdoublethink\u201d as the capacity to hold two contradictory ideas in mind and to believe them both, a malady only imaginable in ultra-totalitarian states. Adopting the first idea, we must arm ourselves to the teeth to protect ourselves from the demonic plans of the paper tiger, even though Russian military spending is a fraction of NATO\u2019s, even excluding the U.S. Those suffering memory loss will be delighted that Germany has finally gotten the word, and may soon surpass Russia in military spending. Now Putin will have to think twice before conquering western Europe. To repeat the obvious, the war in Ukraine can end with a diplomatic settlement, or with the defeat of one side, either quickly or in prolonged agony. Diplomacy, by definition, is a give-and-take affair. Each side must accept it. It follows that in a diplomatic settlement, Putin must be offered some escape hatch. We either accept the first option, or we reject it. That at least is not controversial. If we reject it, we are choosing the second option. Since that is the near-universal preference in Western discourse, and continues to be U.S. policy, let\u2019s consider what it entails. The answer is straightforward: The decision to reject diplomacy means that we will engage in an experiment to see whether the irrational mad dog will slink away quietly in total defeat, or whether he will use the means that he certainly has to destroy Ukraine and set the stage for terminal war. And while conducting this grotesque experiment with the lives of Ukrainians, we will ensure that millions starve from the food crisis, we will toy with the possibility of nuclear war, and we will race on enthusiastically to destroying the environment that sustains life."

    "input": "It is of course conceivable that Putin will just surrender, and that he\u2019ll refrain from using the forces at his command. And perhaps we can simply laugh off the prospects of resort to nuclear weapons. Conceivable, but what kind of person would be willing to take that gamble?",
    "output": "The answer is: Western leaders, quite explicitly, along with the political class. That has been obvious for years, even stated officially. And to make sure that all understand, the position was forcefully reiterated in April at the first monthly meeting of the \u201cContact Group,\u201d which includes NATO and partner countries. The meeting was not held at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Rather, all pretenses were dropped, and it was held at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany; technically German territory, but in the real world belonging to the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin opened the meeting by declaring that \u201cUkraine clearly believes it can win and so does everyone here.\u201d Therefore, the assembled dignitaries should have no hesitation in pouring advanced weapons into Ukraine and persisting in the other programs, proudly announced, to bring Ukraine effectively within the NATO system. In their wisdom, the attending dignitaries and their leader guarantee that Putin will not react in ways they all know he can. The record of military planning for many years, in fact centuries, indicates that \u201ceveryone here\u201d may indeed hold these remarkable beliefs. Whether they do or not, they are, clearly, willing to carry out the experiment with the lives of Ukrainians and the future of life on Earth. Since we are assured on this high authority that Russia will passively observe all of this with no reaction, we can take further steps to \u201cintegrate Ukraine into NATO de facto,\u201d in accord with the goals of the Ukrainian defense ministry, establishing \u201cfull compatibility of the Ukrainian army with the armies of NATO countries\u201d \u2014 thereby also guaranteeing that no diplomatic settlement can be reached with any Russian government, unless Russia is somehow turned into a U.S. satellite. Current U.S. policy calls for a long war to \u201cweaken Russia\u201d and ensure its total defeat. The policy is very similar to the Afghan model of the 1980s, which is, in fact, now explicitly advocated in high places; by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for example. Since that is close to current U.S. policy, even a working model, it is worthwhile to look at what actually happened in Afghanistan in the \u201880s when Russia invaded. Fortunately, we now have a detailed and authoritative account by Diego Cordovez, who directed the successful UN programs that ended the war, and the distinguished journalist and scholar Selig Harrison, who has extensive experience in the region. The Cordovez-Harrison analysis completely overthrows the received version. They demonstrate that the war was ended by careful UN-run diplomacy, not by military force. Soviet military forces were fully capable of continuing the war. The U.S. policy of mobilizing and funding the most extremist radical Islamists to fight the Russians amounted to \u201cfighting to the last Afghan,\u201d they conclude, in a proxy war to weaken the Soviet Union. \u201cThe United States did its best to prevent the emergence of a U.N. role,\u201d that is, the careful diplomatic efforts that ended the war. U.S. policy apparently delayed the Russian withdrawal that had been contemplated from shortly after the invasion \u2014 which, they show, had limited objectives, with no resemblance to the awesome goals of world conquest that were conjured up in U.S. propaganda. \u201cThe Soviet invasion was clearly not the first step in an expansionist master plan of a united leadership,\u201d Harrison writes, confirming the conclusions of historian David Gibbs based on released Soviet archives. The chief CIA officer in Islamabad, who ran the operations directly, put the main point simply: The goal was to kill Russian soldiers \u2014 to give Russia their Vietnam, as proclaimed by high U.S. officials, revealing the colossal inability to understand anything about Indochina that was the hallmark of U.S. policy for decades of slaughter and destruction. Cordovez-Harrison wrote that the U.S. government \u201cwas divided from the start between \u2018bleeders,\u2019 who wanted to keep Soviet forces pinned down in Afghanistan and thus to avenge Vietnam, and \u2018dealers\u2019, who wanted to compel their withdrawal through a combination of diplomacy and military pressure.\u201d It\u2019s a distinction that shows up very often. The bleeders usually win, causing immense damage. For \u201cthe decider,\u201d to borrow W. Bush\u2019s self-description, it is safer to look tough than to appear to be too soft. Afghanistan is a case in point. In the Carter administration, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance was a dealer, who suggested far-reaching compromises that would have almost certainly prevented, or at least sharply curtailed, what was intended to be a limited intervention. National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski was the bleeder, intent on avenging Vietnam, whatever that meant in his confused world view, and killing Russians, something he understood very well, and relished. Brzezinski prevailed. He convinced Carter to send arms to the opposition that was seeking to overthrow the pro-Russian government, anticipating that the Russians would be drawn into a Vietnam-style quagmire. When it happened, he could barely contain his delight. When asked later whether he had any regrets, he dismissed the question as ridiculous. His success in drawing Russia into the Afghan trap, he claimed, was responsible for the collapse of the Soviet empire and ending the Cold War \u2014 mostly nonsense. And who cares if it harmed \u201csome agitated Muslims,\u201d like the million cadavers, putting aside such incidentals as the devastation of Afghanistan, and the rise of radical Islam. The Afghan analogy is being publicly advocated today, and more importantly, is being implemented in policy. The dealer-bleeder distinction is nothing new in foreign policy circles. A famous example from the early days of the Cold War is the conflict between George Kennan (a dealer) and Paul Nitze (a bleeder), won by Nitze, laying the basis for many years of brutality and near destruction. Cordovez-Harrison explicitly endorse Kennan\u2019s approach, with ample evidence. An example close to Vance-Brzezinski is the conflict between Secretary of State William Rogers (a dealer) and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger (a bleeder) over Middle East Policy in the Richard Nixon years. Rogers proposed reasonable diplomatic solutions to the Israel-Arab conflict. Kissinger, whose ignorance of the region was monumental, insisted on confrontation, leading to the 1973 war, a close call for Israel with a serious threat of nuclear war."

    "input": "These conflicts are perennial, almost. Today there are only bleeders in high places. They have gone as far as to enact a huge Lend Lease Act for Ukraine, passed almost unanimously. The terminology is designed to evoke the memory of the enormous Lend-Lease program that brought the U.S. into the European war (as intended) and linked the European and Asian conflicts into a World War (unintended). \u201cLend Lease tied together the separate struggles in Europe and Asia to create by the end of 1941 what we properly call World War II,\u201d writes Adam Tooze. Is that what we want in today\u2019s quite different circumstances?",
    "output": "If that is what we want, as seems to be the case, let us at least reflect on what it entails. That is important enough to repeat. It entails that we reject out of hand the kind of diplomatic initiatives that in reality ended the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, despite U.S. efforts to impede them. We therefore undertake an experiment to see whether integration of Ukraine into NATO, total defeat of Russia in Ukraine, and further moves to \u201cweaken Russia,\u201d will be observed passively by the Russian leadership, or whether they will resort to the means of violence they unquestionably possess to devastate Ukraine and set the stage for possible general war. Meanwhile, by extending the conflict instead of seeking to end it, we impose severe costs on Ukrainians, drive millions of people to death by starvation, hurtle the burning planet even more rapidly to the sixth mass extinction, and \u2014 if we are lucky \u2014 escape terminal war. No problem, the government and political class tell us. The experiment carries no risk because the Russian leadership is sure to accept all of this with equanimity, passing quietly into the ash heap of history. As for the \u201ccollateral damage,\u201d they can join the ranks of Brzezinski\u2019s \u201cagitated Muslims.\u201d To borrow the phrase made famous by Madeleine Albright: \u201cThis is a very hard choice, but the price \u2014 we think the price is worth it.\u201d Let\u2019s at least have the honesty to recognize what we are doing, eyes open."

A distinguished astrophysicist, Fermi knew that there are a huge number of planets within the reach of potential contact that have the conditions to sustain life and higher intelligence. But with the most assiduous search, we can find no trace of their existence. So where are they?",
    "output": "One response that has been seriously proposed, and cannot be dismissed, is that higher intelligence has developed innumerable times, but has proven to be lethal: It discovered the means for self-annihilation but did not develop the moral capacity to prevent it. Perhaps that is even an inherent feature of what we call \u201chigher intelligence.\u201d We are now engaged in an experiment to determine whether this grim principle holds of modern humans, a very recent arrival on Earth, some 200,000-300,000 years ago, a flick of an eye in evolutionary time. There is not much time to find the answer \u2014 or more precisely, to determine the answer, as we will do, one way or the other. That is unavoidable. We will either act to show that our moral capacity reaches as far as to control our technical capacity to destroy, or that it does not. An extraterrestrial observer, if there were one, would unfortunately conclude that the gap is too immense to prevent species suicide, and with it the sixth mass extinction. But it could be mistaken. That decision is in our hands. There is a rough measure of the gap between capacity to destroy and capacity to contain that death wish: the Doomsday Clock of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. The distance of the hands from midnight can be regarded as an indication of the gap. In 1953, when the U.S. and Soviet Union exploded thermonuclear weapons, the minute-hand was set to two minutes to midnight. It did not reach that point again until Donald Trump\u2019s term in office. In his last year, the analysts abandoned minutes and switched to seconds: 100 seconds to midnight, where the clock now stands. Next January it will be set again. It\u2019s not hard to make a case that the second-hand should move closer to midnight. The grim question arose with brilliant clarity on August 6, 1945. That day provided two lessons: 1.) human intelligence, in its glory, was approaching the capacity to destroy everything, an achievement reached in 1953; and 2.) human moral capacity lagged far behind. Few even cared, as people of my age will remember very well. Viewing the hideous experiment to which we are enthusiastically committed today, and what it entails, it is hard to see improvement, to put it mildly. That doesn\u2019t answer the question. We know far too little to answer it. We can only observe closely the one case of \u201chigher intelligence\u201d that we know of, and ask what it suggests about the answer. Far more importantly, we can act to determine the answer. It is within our power to bring about the answer that we all hope for, but there is no time to waste."

    "input": "David Barsamian: Let\u2019s head into the most obvious nightmare of this moment, the war in Ukraine and its effects globally. But first a little background. Let\u2019s start with President George H.W. Bush\u2019s assurance to then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not move \u201cone inch to the east\u201d \u2014 and that pledge has been verified. My question to you is, why didn\u2019t Gorbachev get that in writing?",
    "output": "He accepted a gentleman\u2019s agreement, which is not that uncommon in diplomacy. Shake-of-the-hand. Furthermore, having it on paper would have made no difference whatsoever. Treaties that are on paper are torn up all the time. What matters is good faith. And in fact, H.W. Bush, the first Bush, did honor the agreement explicitly. He even moved toward instituting a partnership in peace, which would accommodate the countries of Eurasia. NATO wouldn\u2019t be disbanded but would be marginalized. Countries like Tajikistan, for example, could join without formally being part of NATO. And Gorbachev approved of that. It would have been a step toward creating what he called a commonEuropean home with no military alliances. Clinton in his first couple of years also adhered to it. What the specialists say is that by about 1994, Clinton started to, as they put it, talk from both sides of his mouth. To the Russians he was saying: Yes, we\u2019re going to adhere to the agreement. To the Polish community in the United States and other ethnic minorities, he was saying: Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll incorporate you within NATO. By about 1996-97, Clinton said this pretty explicitly to his friend Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whom he had helped win the 1996 election. He told Yeltsin: Don\u2019t push too hard on this NATO business. We\u2019re going to expand but I need it because of the ethnic vote in the United States. In 1997, Clinton invited the so-called Visegrad countries \u2014 Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania \u2014 to join NATO. The Russians didn\u2019t like it but didn\u2019t make much of a fuss. Then the Baltic nations joined, again the same thing. In 2008, the second Bush, who was quite different from the first, invited Georgia and Ukraine into NATO. Every U.S. diplomat understood very well that Georgia and Ukraine were red lines for Russia. They\u2019ll tolerate the expansion elsewhere, but these are in their geostrategic heartland and they\u2019re not going to tolerate expansion there. To continue with the story, the Maidan uprising took place in 2014, expelling the pro-Russian president and Ukraine moved toward the West. From 2014, the U.S. and NATO began to pour arms into Ukraine \u2014 advanced weapons, military training, joint military exercises, moves to integrate Ukraine into the NATO military command. There\u2019s no secret about this. It was quite open. Recently, the Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, bragged about it. He said: This is what we were doing since 2014. Well, of course, this is very consciously, highly provocative. They knew that they were encroaching on what every Russian leader regarded as an intolerable move. France and Germany vetoed it in 2008, but under U.S. pressure, it was kept on the agenda. And NATO, meaning the United States, moved to accelerate the de facto integration of Ukraine into the NATO military command. In 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky was elected with an overwhelming majority \u2014 I think about 70% of the vote \u2014 on a peace platform, a plan to implement peace with Eastern Ukraine and Russia, to settle the problem. He began to move forward on it and, in fact, tried to go to the Donbas, the Russian-oriented eastern region, to implement what\u2019s called the Minsk II agreement. It would have meant a kind of federalization of Ukraine with a degree of autonomy for the Donbas, which is what they wanted. Something like Switzerland or Belgium. He was blocked by right-wing militias which threatened to murder him if he persisted with his effort. Well, he\u2019s a courageous man. He could have gone forward if he had had any backing from the United States. The U.S. refused. No backing, nothing, which meant he was left to hang out to dry and had to back off. The U.S. was intent on this policy of integrating Ukraine step by step into the NATO military command. That accelerated further when President Biden was elected. In September 2021, you could read it on the White House website. It wasn\u2019t reported but, of course, the Russians knew it. Biden announced a program, a joint statement to accelerate the process of military training, military exercises, more weapons as part of what his administration called an \u201cenhanced program\u201d of preparation for NATO membership. It accelerated further in November. This was all before the invasion. Secretary of State Antony Blinken signed what was called a charter, which essentially formalized and extended this arrangement. A spokesman for the State Department conceded that before the invasion, the U.S. refused to discuss any Russian security concerns. All of this is part of the background. On February 24th, Putin invaded, a criminal invasion. These serious provocations provide no justification for it. If Putin had been a statesman, what he would have done is something quite different. He would have gone back to French President Emmanuel Macron, grasped his tentative proposals, and moved to try to reach an accommodation with Europe, to take steps toward a European common home. The U.S., of course, has always been opposed to that. This goes way back in Cold War history to French President De Gaulle\u2019s initiatives to establish an independent Europe. In his phrase \u201cfrom the Atlantic to the Urals,\u201d integrating Russia with the West, which was a very natural accommodation for trade reasons and, obviously, security reasons as well. So, had there been any statesmen within Putin\u2019s narrow circle, they would have grasped Macron\u2019s initiatives and experimented to see whether, in fact, they could integrate with Europe and avert the crisis. Instead, what he chose was a policy which, from the Russian point of view, was total imbecility. Apart from the criminality of the invasion, he chose a policy that drove Europe deep into the pocket of the United States. In fact, it is even inducing Sweden and Finland to join NATO \u2014 the worst possible outcome from the Russian point of view, quite apart from the criminality of the invasion, and the very serious losses that Russia is suffering because of that. So, criminality and stupidity on the Kremlin side, severe provocation on the U.S. side. That\u2019s the background that has led to this. Can we try to bring this horror to an end? Or should we try to perpetuate it? Those are the choices. There\u2019s only one way to bring it to an end. That\u2019s diplomacy. Now, diplomacy, by definition, means both sides accept it. They don\u2019t like it, but they accept it as the least bad option. It would offer Putin some kind of escape hatch. That\u2019s one possibility. The other is just to drag it out and see how much everybody will suffer, how many Ukrainians will die, how much Russia will suffer, how many millions of people will starve to death in Asia and Africa, how much we\u2019ll proceed toward heating the environment to the point where there will be no possibility for a livable human existence. Those are the options. Well, with near 100% unanimity, the United States and most of Europe want to pick the no-diplomacy option. It\u2019s explicit. We have to keep going to hurt Russia. You can read columns in theNew York Times, the LondonFinancial Times, all over Europe. A common refrain is: we\u2019ve got to make sure that Russia suffers. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens to Ukraine or anyone else. Of course, this gamble assumes that if Putin is pushed to the limit, with no escape, forced to admit defeat, he\u2019ll accept that and not use the weapons he has to devastate Ukraine. There are a lot of things that Russia hasn\u2019t done. Western analysts are rather surprised by it. Namely, they\u2019ve not attacked the supply lines from Poland that are pouring weapons into Ukraine. They certainly could do it. That would very soon bring them into direct confrontation with NATO, meaning the U.S. Where it goes from there, you can guess. Anyone who\u2019s ever looked at war games knows where it\u2019ll go \u2014 up the escalatory ladder toward terminal nuclear war. So, those are the games we\u2019re playing with the lives of Ukrainians, Asians, and Africans, the future of civilization, in order to weaken Russia, to make sure that they suffer enough. Well, if you want to play that game, be honest about it. There\u2019s no moral basis for it. In fact, it\u2019s morally horrendous. And the people who are standing on a high horse about how we\u2019re upholding principle are moral imbeciles when you think about what\u2019s involved."

No doubt they are occurring as they do in every war. Don\u2019t you find that moral outrage a bit selective though?",
    "output": "The moral outrage is quite in place. There should be moral outrage. But you go to the Global South, they just can\u2019t believe what they\u2019re seeing. They condemn the war, of course. It\u2019s a deplorable crime of aggression. Then they look at the West and say: What are you guys talking about? This is what you do to us all the time. It\u2019s kind of astonishing to see the difference in commentary. So, you read theNew York Timesand their big thinker, Thomas Friedman. He wrote a column a couple of weeks ago in which he just threw up his hands in despair. He said: What can we do? How can we live in a world that has a war criminal? We\u2019ve never experienced this since Hitler. There\u2019s a war criminal in Russia. We\u2019re at a loss as to how to act. We\u2019ve never imagined the idea that there could be a war criminal anywhere. When people in the Global South hear this, they don\u2019t know whether to crack up in laughter or ridicule. We have war criminals walking all over Washington. Actually, we know how to deal with our war criminals. In fact, it happened on the twentieth anniversary of the invasion of Afghanistan. Remember, this was an entirely unprovoked invasion, strongly opposed by world opinion. There was an interview with the perpetrator, George W. Bush, who then went on to invade Iraq, a major war criminal, in the style section of theWashington Post\u2014 an interview with, as they described it, this lovable goofy grandpa who was playing with his grandchildren, making jokes, showing off the portraits he painted of famous people he\u2019d met. Just a beautiful, friendly environment. So, we know how to deal with war criminals. Thomas Friedman is wrong. We deal with them very well. Or take probably the major war criminal of the modern period, Henry Kissinger. We deal with him not only politely, but with great admiration. This is the man after all who transmitted the order to the Air Force, saying that there should be massive bombing of Cambodia \u2014 \u201canything that flies on anything that moves\u201d was his phrase. I don\u2019t know of a comparable example in the archival record of a call for mass genocide. And it was implemented with very intensive bombing of Cambodia. We don\u2019t know much about it because we don\u2019t investigate our own crimes. But Taylor Owen and Ben Kiernan, serious historians of Cambodia, have described it. Then there\u2019s our role in overthrowing Salvador Allende\u2019s government in Chile and instituting a vicious dictatorship there, and on and on. So, we do know how to deal with our war criminals. Still, Thomas Friedman can\u2019t imagine that there\u2019s anything like Ukraine. Nor was there any commentary on what he wrote, which means it was regarded as quite reasonable. You can hardly use the word selectivity. It\u2019s beyond astonishing. So, yes, the moral outrage is perfectly in place. It\u2019s good that Americans are finally beginning to show some outrage about major war crimes committed by someone else."

So, they\u2019re completely militarily incompetent. The other thought is: they\u2019re poised to conquer the West and destroy us. George Orwell had a name for that. He called it doublethink, the capacity to have two contradictory ideas in your mind and believe both of them. Orwell mistakenly thought that was something you could only have in the ultra-totalitarian state he was satirizing in1984.He was wrong. You can have it in free democratic societies. We\u2019re seeing a dramatic example of it right now. Incidentally, this is not the first time. Such doublethink is, for instance, characteristic of Cold War thinking. You go way back to the major Cold War document of those years, NSC-68 in 1950. Look at it carefully and it showed that Europe alone, quite apart from the United States, was militarily on a par with Russia. But of course, we still had to have a huge rearmament program to counter the Kremlin design for world conquest. That\u2019s one document and it was a conscious approach. Dean Acheson, one of the authors, later said that it\u2019s necessary to be \u201cclearer than truth,\u201d his phrase, in order to bludgeon the mass mind of government. We want to drive through this huge military budget, so we have to be \u201cclearer than truth\u201d by concocting a slave state that\u2019s about to conquer the world. Such thinking runs right through the Cold War. I could give you many other examples, but we\u2019re seeing it again now quite dramatically. And the way you put it is exactly correct: these two ideas are consuming the West. Barsamian: It\u2019s also interesting that diplomat George Kennan foresaw the danger of NATO moving its borders east in a very prescient op-ed he wrote that appeared in The New York Times in 1997. Kennan had also been opposed to NSC-68. In fact, he had been the director of the State Department Policy Planning Staff. He was kicked out and replaced by Paul Nitze. He was regarded as too soft for such a hard world. He was a hawk, radically anticommunist, pretty brutal himself with regard to U.S. positions, but he realized that military confrontation with Russia made no sense. Russia, he thought, would ultimately collapse from internal contradictions, which turned out to be correct. But he was considered a dove all the way through. In 1952, he was in favor of the unification of Germany outside the NATO military alliance. That was actually Soviet ruler Joseph Stalin\u2019s proposal as well. Kennan was ambassador to the Soviet Union and a Russia specialist. Stalin\u2019s initiative. Kennan\u2019s proposal. Some Europeans supported it. It would have ended the Cold War. It would have meant a neutralized Germany, non-militarized and not part of any military bloc. It was almost totally ignored in Washington. There was one foreign policy specialist, a respected one, James Warburg, who wrote a book about it. It\u2019s worth reading. It\u2019s calledGermany: Key to Peace. In it, he urged that this idea be taken seriously. He was disregarded, ignored, ridiculed. I mentioned it a couple of times and was ridiculed as a lunatic, too. How could you believe Stalin? Well, the archives came out. Turns out he was apparently serious. You now read the leading Cold War historians, people like Melvin Leffler, and they recognize that there was a real opportunity for a peaceful settlement at the time, which was dismissed in favor of militarization, of a huge expansion of the military budget. Now, let\u2019s go to the Kennedy administration. When John Kennedy came into office, Nikita Khrushchev, leading Russia at the time, made a very important offer to carry out large-scale mutual reductions in offensive military weapons, which would have meant a sharp relaxation of tensions. The United States was far ahead militarily then. Khrushchev wanted to move toward economic development in Russia and understood that this was impossible in the context of a military confrontation with a far richer adversary. So, he first made that offer to President Dwight Eisenhower, who paid no attention. It was then offered to Kennedy and his administration responded with the largest peacetime buildup of military force in history \u2014 even though they knew that the United States was already far ahead. The U.S. concocted a \u201cmissile gap.\u201d Russia was about to overwhelm us with its advantage in missiles. Well, when the missile gap was exposed, it turned out to be in favor of the U.S. Russia had maybe four missiles exposed on an airbase somewhere. You can go on and on like this. The security of the population is simply not a concern for policymakers. Security for the privileged, the rich, the corporate sector, arms manufacturers, yes, but not the rest of us. This doublethink is constant, sometimes conscious, sometimes not. It\u2019s just what Orwell described, hyper-totalitarianism in a free society."

    "output": "You should read it and you\u2019ll see why it\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s the best speech he ever made. This was 1953 when he was just taking office. Basically, what he pointed out was that militarization was a tremendous attack on our own society. He \u2014 or whoever wrote the speech \u2014 put it pretty eloquently. One jet plane means this many fewer schools and hospitals. Every time we\u2019re building up our military budget, we\u2019re attacking ourselves. He spelled it out in some detail, calling for a decline in the military budget. He had a pretty awful record himself, but in this respect he was right on target. And those words should be emblazoned in everyone\u2019s memory. Recently, in fact, Biden proposed a huge military budget. Congress expanded it even beyond his wishes, which represents a major attack on our society, exactly as Eisenhower explained so many years ago. The excuse: the claim that we have to defend ourselves from this paper tiger, so militarily incompetent it can\u2019t move a couple of miles beyond its border without collapse. So, with a monstrous military budget, we have to severely harm ourselves and endanger the world, wasting enormous resources that will be necessary if we\u2019re going to deal with the severe existential crises we face. Meanwhile, we pour taxpayer funds into the pockets of the fossil-fuel producers so that they can continue to destroy the world as quickly as possible. That\u2019s what we\u2019re witnessing with the vast expansion of both fossil-fuel production and military expenditures. There are people who are happy about this. Go to the executive offices of Lockheed Martin, ExxonMobil, they\u2019re ecstatic. It\u2019s a bonanza for them. They\u2019re even being given credit for it. Now, they\u2019re being lauded for saving civilization by destroying the possibility for life on Earth. Forget the Global South.

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: Noam, we are already a month into the war in Ukraine and peace talks have stalled. In fact, Putin is turning up the volume on violence as the West increases military aid to Ukraine. In aprevious interview, you compared Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine to the Nazi invasion of Poland. Is Putin\u2019s strategy then straight out of Hitler\u2019s playbook? Does he want to occupy all of Ukraine? Is he trying to rebuild the Russian empire? Is this why peace negotiations have stalled?",
    "output": "There is very little credible information about the negotiations. Some of the information leaking out sounds mildly optimistic. There is good reason to suppose that if the U.S. were to agree to participate seriously, with a constructive program, the possibilities for an end to the horror would be enhanced. What a constructive program would be, at least in general outline, is no secret. The primary element is commitment to neutrality for Ukraine: no membership in a hostile military alliance, no hosting of weapons aimed at Russia (even those misleadingly called \u201cdefensive\u201d), no military maneuvers with hostile military forces. That would hardly be something new in world affairs, even where nothing formal exists. Everyone understands that Mexico cannot join a Chinese-run military alliance, emplace Chinese weapons aimed at the U.S. and carry out military maneuvers with the People\u2019s Liberation Army. In brief, a constructive program would be about the opposite of the Joint Statement on the U.S.-Ukraine Strategic Partnership signed by the White House on September 1, 2021. This document, which received little notice, forcefully declared that the door for Ukraine to join NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is wide open. It also \u201cfinalized a Strategic Defense Framework that creates a foundation for the enhancement of U.S.-Ukraine strategic defense and security cooperation\u201d by providing Ukraine with advanced anti-tank and other weapons along with a \u201crobust training and exercise program in keeping with Ukraine\u2019s status as a NATO Enhanced Opportunities Partner.\u201d The statement was another purposeful exercise in poking the bear in the eye. It is another contribution to a process that NATO (meaning Washington) has been perfecting since Bill Clinton\u2019s 1998 violation of George H.W. Bush\u2019s firm pledge not to expand NATO to the East, a decision that elicited strong warnings from high-level diplomats from George Kennan, Henry Kissinger, Jack Matlock, (current CIA Director) William Burns, and many others, and led Defense Secretary William Perry to come close to resigning in protest, joined by a long list of others with eyes open. That\u2019s of course in addition to the aggressive actions that struck directly at Russia\u2019s concerns (Serbia, Iraq, Libya, and lesser crimes), conducted in such a way as to maximize the humiliation. It doesn\u2019t strain credulity to suspect that that the joint statement was a factor in inducing Putin and the narrowing circle of \u201chard men\u201d around him to decide to step up their annual mobilization of forces on the Ukrainian border in an effort to gain some attention to their security concerns, in this case on to direct criminal aggression \u2014 which, indeed, we can compare with the Nazi invasion of Poland (in combination with Stalin). Neutralization of Ukraine is the main element of a constructive program, but there is more. There should be moves towards some kind of federal arrangement for Ukraine involving a degree of autonomy for the Donbass region, along the general lines of what remains of Minsk II. Again, that would be nothing new in world affairs. No two cases are identical, and no real example is anywhere near perfect, but federal structures exist in Switzerland and Belgium, among other cases \u2014 even the U.S. to an extent. Serious diplomatic efforts might find a solution to this problem, or at least contain the flames. And the flames are real. Estimates are that some 15,000 people have been killed in conflict in this region since 2014. That leaves Crimea. On Crimea, the West has two choices. One is to recognize that the Russian annexation is simply a fact of life for now, irreversible without actions that would destroy Ukraine and possibly far more. The other is to disregard the highly likely consequences and to strike heroic gestures about how the U.S. \u201cwill never recognize Russia\u2019s purported annexation of Crimea,\u201d as the joint statement proclaims, accompanied by many eloquent pronouncements by others who are willing to consign Ukraine to utter catastrophe while advertising their bravery. Like it or not, those are the choices. Does Putin want to \u201coccupy all of Ukraine and rebuild the Russian empire?\u201d His announced goals (mainly neutralization) are quite different, including his statement that it would be madness to try to reconstruct the old Soviet Union, but he might have had something like this in mind. If so, it\u2019s hard to imagine what he and his circle still do. For Russia to occupy Ukraine would make its experience in Afghanistan look like a picnic in the park. By now that\u2019s abundantly clear. Putin does have the military capacity \u2014 and judging by Chechnya and other escapades, the moral capacity \u2014 to leave Ukraine in smoldering ruins. That would mean no occupation, no Russian empire and no more Putin. Our eyes are rightly focused on the mounting horrors of Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. It would be a mistake, however, to forget that the joint statement is only one of the pleasures that the imperial mind is quietly conjuring up. few weeks ago, we discussed President Biden\u2019s National Defense Authorization Act, as little known as the joint statement.This brilliant document \u2014 again quoting Michael Klare \u2014 calls for \u201can unbroken chain of U.S.-armed sentinel states \u2014 stretching from Japan and South Korea in the northern Pacific to Australia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore in the south and India on China\u2019s eastern flank\u201d \u2014 meant to encircle China, including Taiwan, \u201cominously enough.\u201d We might ask how China feels about the fact that the U.S. Indo-Pacific command is now reported to be planning to enhance the encirclement, doubling its spending in fiscal year 2022, in part to develop \u201ca network of precision-strike missiles along the so-called first island chain.\u201d For defense, of course, so the Chinese [government has] no reason for concern."

But what about Ukraine arming civilians to fight against the invaders? Isn\u2019t this morally justified on the same grounds that resistance against the Nazis was morally justified?",
    "output": "Just war theory, regrettably, has about as much relevance to the real world as \u201chumanitarian intervention,\u201d \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d or \u201cdefending democracy.\u201d On the surface, it seems a virtual truism that a people in arms have the right to defend themselves against a brutal aggressor. But as always in this sad world, questions arise when we think about it a little. Take the resistance against the Nazis. There could hardly have been a more noble cause. One can certainly understand and sympathize with the motives of Herschel Grynszpan when he assassinated a German diplomat in 1938; or the British-trained partisans who assassinated the Nazi murderer Reinhard Heydrich in May 1942. And one can admire their courage and passion for justice, without qualification. That\u2019s not the end, however. The first provided the Nazis with the pretext for the atrocities of Kristallnacht and impelled the Nazi program further toward its hideous outcomes. The second led to the shocking Lidice massacres. Events have consequences. The innocent suffer, perhaps terribly. Such questions cannot be avoided by people with a moral bone in their bodies. The questions cannot fail to arise when we consider whether and how to arm those courageously resisting murderous aggression. That\u2019s the least of it. In the present case, we also have to ask what risks we are willing to take of a nuclear war, which will not only spell the end of Ukraine but far beyond, to the truly unthinkable. It is not encouraging that over a third of Americans favor \u201ctaking military action [in Ukraine] even if it risks a nuclear conflict with Russia,\u201d perhaps inspired by commentators and political leaders who should think twice before doing their Winston Churchill impersonations. Perhaps ways can be found to provide needed arms to the defenders of Ukraine to repel the aggressors while avoiding dire consequences. But we should not delude ourselves into believing that it is a simple matter, to be settled by bold pronouncements. Do you anticipate dramatic political developments inside Russia if the war lasts much longer or if Ukrainians resist even after formal battles have ended? After all, Russia\u2019s economy is already under siege and could end up with an economic collapse unparalleled in recent history. I don\u2019t know enough about Russia even to hazard a guess. One person who does know enough at least to \u201cspeculate\u201d \u2014 and only that, as he reminds us \u2014 is Anatol Lieven, whose insights have been a very useful guide all along. He regards \u201cdramatic political developments\u201d as highly unlikely because of the nature of the harsh kleptocracy that Putin has carefully constructed. Among the more optimistic guesses, \u201cthe most likely scenario,\u201d Lieven writes, \u201cis a sort of semi-coup, most of which will never become apparent in public, by which Putin and his immediate associates will step down \u2018voluntarily\u2019 in return for guarantees of their personal immunity from arrest and their family\u2019s wealth. Who would succeed as president in these circumstances is a totally open question.\u201d And not necessarily a pleasant question to consider."

Are the resources mobilized by national states during the pandemic crisis a simple case of emergency Keynesianism, or do they represent a fundamental shift in the traditional role of government, which is to maximize society\u2019s welfare? Moreover, are the policies we have seen implemented so far at all levels of government sufficient to provide the basis for a progressive economic agenda in the post-pandemic era?",
    "output": "Robert Pollin:Neoliberalism is a variant of capitalism in which economic policies are weighted heavily in favor of supporting the privileges of big corporations, Wall Street and the rich. Neoliberalism became dominant globally around 1980, beginning with the elections of Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan in the U.S. The top priorities under neoliberalism, as practiced throughout the world, have included: cutting both taxes on the rich along with public spending on the non-rich; weakening protections for both working people and the environment and any semblance of a commitment to full and decent employment; and enabling financial speculation to run rampant while bailing out the speculators when the markets proceed, inevitably, into crises. Neoliberalism represented a counterrevolution against social democratic/New Deal/developmental state variants capitalism, which emerged primarily as a result of successful political struggles by progressive political parties, labor unions and allied social movements, out of the 1930s Depression and continuing through the early 1970s. Of course, social democratic/New Deal/developmental state capitalism was still capitalism. Disparities of income, wealth and opportunity remained intolerably high, along with the malignancies of racism, sexism and imperialism. Nevertheless, the broadly social democratic models produced dramatically more egalitarian versions of capitalism than the neoliberal regime that supplanted these models. The neoliberal model, in turn, has been highly successful in achieving its most basic aim, which is to shower ever-greater advantages on the already over-privileged. For example, under neoliberalism in the United States between 1978 and 2019, the average pay for big corporate CEOs has risentenfoldrelative to the average non-supervisory worker. With the onset of the COVID pandemic in March 2020, government policies in the high-income countries did pursue measures to prevent a total, 1930s-level economic collapse. Depending on the country, these measures included direct cash support for lower- and middle-income people, significant increases in unemployment insurance and large payroll subsidy programs to prevent layoffs. But by far, the most aggressive policy interventions were the bailouts provided for big corporations and Wall Street. In the U.S., for example, nearly 50 percent of the entire labor force filed for unemployment benefits between March 2020 and February 2021. However, over this same period, Wall Street stock prices rose by 46 percent, one of the sharpest one-year increases on record. The same pattern prevailed globally. The International Labour Organization reported that, \u201cThere were unprecedented global employment losses in 2020 of 114 million jobs relative to 2019.\u201d At the same time, global stock markets rose sharply \u2014 by 45 percent throughout Europe, 56 percent in China, 58 percent in the U.K., and 80 percent in Japan, and with Standard & Poor\u2019s Global 1200 index rising by 67 percent. So while there was a desperately needed expansion of social welfare programs helping people to survive under COVID, these measures were enacted within the framework of still larger efforts to prop up the still prevailing neoliberal order. Of course, the severity of the climate crisis has continued to deepen during the pandemic. In February, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said, \u201c2021 is a make-or-break year to confront the global climate emergency.... Governments are nowhere close to the level of ambition needed to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The major emitters must step up with much more ambitious emissions reductions targets for 2030 ... well before the November UN Climate Conference in Glasgow.\u201d We are now into October in the \u201cmake or break year\u201d and yet, little has been accomplished since Guterres spoke in February. It is true that, throughout the high-income countries, social movements and climate activists are fighting to advance programs that combine climate stabilization and an egalitarian social agenda, under the rubric of a global Green New Deal. The extent to which they succeed will determine whether we will have established a basis for a progressive economic agenda and effective climate policies in the post-pandemic era. We do not yet know how successful these efforts will be. As we discussed at some length recently, the social infrastructure and climate proposal being debated right now in the U.S. Congress is itself not ambitious enough to be truly transformative. But if it is enacted, it will still represent a significant break from neoliberal dominance that has prevailed since Thatcher and Reagan."

    "output": "Costas Lapavitsas:There is no question that the pandemic shock represents a tremendous crisis of global capitalism, but I would urge strong caution regarding the collapse of neoliberalism. The period since the Great Crisis of 2007-2009 looks more like an interregnum (a term offered in the spirit of Antonio Gramsci) when the old is refusing to die and the new cannot be born. And like all such periods, it is prone to monsters, including fascism. The Great Crisis of 2007-2009 was overcome by the state deploying its massive strength to defend financialized capitalism and globalization. But what followed was a decade of low growth, poor investment, weak productivity growth, sustained inequality and partially revived profits. Economic performance was poor in core countries, providing further evidence of the failure of neoliberalism. The Golden Era of financialization is well and truly over, despite the sustained rise of stock markets in the previous decade. Yet, economic performance was also mediocre in China, reflecting an underlying weakness of productive accumulation across the world. When COVID-19 struck, it became crystal clear that contemporary capitalism is entirely dependent on massive state intervention. Core Western states were able to intervene on an unprecedented scale mostly because of monopoly command by central banks over fiat money. Unlike 2007-2009, however, the state also deployed fiat money to relax austerity, thus engaging in the unspoken nationalization of the wage bill and the income statements of thousands of enterprises. It is a misunderstanding that neoliberalism necessarily means marginalizing the state and imposing austerity. Rather, it is about using the state selectively to defend the interests of a small elite, an oligarchy, associated with big business and the financial sector. Fundamentally, it stands for shifting the balance of power in favor of capital by removing controls on its activities. When the pandemic shock threatened the foundations of class rule, austerity and forbearing from direct economic intervention were abandoned in the blink of an eye. The neoliberal ideologists rapidly adapted to the new reality, though it is always possible that austerity will return. What has not taken place is an institutional shift in favor of workers\u2019 interests that would limit the freedom of capital. It is primarily in this sense that the old is refusing to die. The pandemic also made it clear that there is great variety in the relationship between powerful states and domestic capitalist accumulation. Core Western states, in the grip of neoliberal ideology, derive their strength primarily from command over fiat money. In contrast, the Chinese state remains directly involved in both productive accumulation and finance as well as having possession over vast resources. Their respective responses to the pandemic differed greatly. Inevitably there has been a tremendous escalation in the contest for global hegemony, including in the military field. For the first time since 1914, moreover, the hegemonic contest is also immediately economic. The Soviet Union was exclusively a political and military contestant to the U.S. \u2014 the Lada could never compete with Chrysler. But China can outcompete the U.S. economically, making the struggle considerably deeper and removing any obvious point of equilibrium. The U.S. ruling bloc realizes that is has made a strategic miscalculation, and this accounts for its current unrelenting aggressiveness. Conditions in the international arena are exceedingly dangerous. Still, the global hegemonic struggle lacks entirely in ideological content. Western neoliberal democracies are exhausted, failed and bereft of new ideas. The attempts of the U.S. ruling bloc to present its aggressiveness as a defense of democracy are hollow and ludicrous. On the other hand, Chinese (and Russian) authoritarianism has considerable domestic support but no capacity to offer a globally appealing social and political perspective. The characteristic feature of the interregnum since 2007-2009 is an ideological impasse. There is tremendous discontent with capitalism, particularly as the degradation of the environment and the warming of the planet have raised great concern among the young. But that concern has not translated into a broad-based mobilization behind fresh socialist ideas and politics. This is the challenge ahead, particularly as the far right is already taking advantage."

Should the left spend political capital by envisioning a postcapitalist future?",
    "output": "Lapavitsas:During the pandemic crisis, the domestic actions of nation states displaced the precepts and prescriptions of neoliberal capitalism, foisted invasive measures on social and personal life centering on public health and hygiene, and imposed severe restrictions on civil liberties and economic activity. The state inflamed political tensions, heightened social polarization and restricted freedoms. Workers paid the greatest price through income loss, rising unemployment and worsening public provision. But the middle strata were also left out in the cold, thus delivering a major blow to the class alliances that supported the neoliberal project. Giant oligopolies in new technology emerged as the main beneficiaries \u2014 Google, Amazon, Microsoft and the rest. Their actions are steadily eclipsing the figure of the citizen as personal identities are increasingly organized around market links to the oligopolies. At the same time, the extreme right was strengthened, a trend that started before the pandemic and has accelerated through the agency of powerful oligarchies. There has been no shortage of grassroots reactions to these developments. Heavy-handed state actions, official cultivation of fear, suspension of rights and liberties, the danger of permanent repression, and the crushing of workers and the middle strata during the lockdowns spurred various responses often in a libertarian direction. Bear in mind that maintaining capitalist accumulation in the years to come will be exceedingly difficult across the world. The underlying weakness of accumulation is far from easy to confront. It is also clear that state intervention in the pandemic has created major difficulties with the disruption of supply chains, the rise of inflation eating into workers\u2019 incomes and the tremendous escalation of public debt. And all that is without even mentioning the broader issues of environment and climate. It is hardly possible that economic growth could be sustained without large-scale state intervention on the supply side through public investment that also involves profound distributional changes in income that benefit workers. It seems even less likely that this would happen without a major shift in property rights, redistributing wealth and productive resources in favor of workers and the poor. Technology alone is never the answer for complex social problems. Indeed, one aspect of the technological revolution of the last four decades is its inability even to improve the economic conditions of accumulation since its effect on the average productivity of labor is modest. I see no reason at this stage to expect that artificial intelligence would prove dramatically different. Perhaps it will, but there are no guarantees. Western neoliberal democracies are ideologically exhausted, and their capitalist economies are beset with problems. In this context, it is imperative for socialists and progressives to think of a postcapitalist future and ascertain its broad parameters. We need to think about the use of digital technologies, the greening of production and the protection of the environment. But all that should take place in social conditions that favor working people and not capitalists, with a new sociality, collective action and individual fulfilment through communal association. The rejuvenation of the socialist promise is the paramount need of the times."

    "input": "Bob, during the neoliberal era, mainstream economics shaded easily into ideology. Indeed, it is rather easy to show that mainstream economic policy is full of misrepresentation of reality. The question is: How does an alleged science become ideology? And how likely it is that the coronavirus pandemic, in conjunction with the flaws of neoliberalism and the urgency of the climate crisis, will lead to an intellectual paradigm shift in \u201cdismal science\u201d?",
    "output": "Pollin:Let\u2019s recognize that all varieties of economists are heavily influenced by ideology, or what the great conservative economist Joseph Schumpeter more judiciously termed their \u201cpre-analytic vision.\u201d Leftist economists, myself included, are as guilty as anyone else. Our ideology influences the questions that we decide are most important to ask. Ideology also provides us with some initial guesses as to what the answers to these questions are likely to be. Still, if we are also attempting to be the least bit scientific, or even minimally honest, as economic researchers, we will put our hunches and our preferred answers to the test of evidence and be open to challenges. I think it is fair to say that, not all, but a high percentage of mainstream economists have not been committed to these minimally objective scientific standards. They rather have been so fully immersed in their ideological biases that they are unable to even think about how they might ask questions differently. Their biases have been reinforced by the fact that these prejudices provide succor to policy regimes that, as noted above, shower benefits on the already overprivileged. Joan Robinson, the renowned Cambridge University economist of the Great Depression and post-World War II era, beautifully captured this allure of orthodox economics as follows: \u201cOne of the main effects (I will not say purposes) of orthodox traditional economics was ... a plan for explaining to the privileged class that their position was morally right and was necessary for the welfare of society.\u201d At the same time, there has been no shortage of progressive economists over the neoliberal era who have stood up to mainstream orthodoxy, as represented, for example, by the 24 people you interviewed in the new book,Economics and the Left:Interviews with Progressive Economists. In my view, how much influence economists such as these will have will depend primarily on how successful are the progressive movements in advancing the Green New Deal and related programs in the coming months and years. There are hopeful signs. Just late last month, the Federal Reserve released a paper by Jeremy Rudd, a senior member of its own staff, which begins with the observation that \u201cmainstream economics is replete with ideas that \u2018everyone knows\u2019 to be true, but that are actually arrant nonsense.\u201d Rudd also notes on page one that he is leaving aside in this paper \u201cthe deeper concern that the primary role of mainstream economics in our society is to provide apologetics for a criminally oppressive, unsustainable, and unjust social order.\u201d There may well be more Jeremy Rudds out there, poised to spring from the shadows of the professional mainstream. This would be a most positive development. But I would also say that it\u2019s about time."

    "input": "Noam, it\u2019s been said by far too many that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. Given that capitalism is actually destroying the Earth, how, firstly, would you respond to the above statement, and, secondly, how do you envision economy and society after capitalism?",
    "output": "I\u2019d prefer to rephrase the question to refer to state capitalism. Those whom Adam Smith called \u201cthe masters of mankind,\u201d the dominant business classes, would never tolerate capitalism, which would expose them to the ravages of the market. That\u2019s for the victims. For the masters, a powerful state is required \u2014 insofar as they can control it and reduce the \u201cunderlying population\u201d (Thorstein Veblen\u2019s ironic term) to subordination and passivity. It does not seem to me too difficult to imagine at least a serious mitigation of the destructive and repressive elements of this system, and its eventual transformation to a far more fair and just society. In fact, we must not only imagine but proceed to implement such programs, or we\u2019ll all be finished \u2014 the masters too. It\u2019s even quite realistic to imagine \u2014 and implement \u2014 the overthrow of the basic state capitalist principle: renting oneself to a master (in a more anodyne formulation, having a job). After all, for millennia it\u2019s been recognized \u2014 in principle at least \u2014 that being subjected to the will of a master is an intolerable attack on human dignity and rights. The concept is not far back in our own history. In late 19th-century America, radical farmers and industrial workers were seeking to create a \u201ccooperative commonwealth\u201d in which they would be free of domination by illegitimate bosses robbing their labor and of northeast bankers and market managers. These powerful movements were so effectively crushed by state-corporate force that today even the highly popular ideas sound exotic. But they are not far below the surface and are even being revived in many important ways. In short, there\u2019s reason to be hopeful that what must be done can be done."

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: Following the undoing of the USSR between 1980-1991, people in Ukraine voted overwhelmingly in 1991 to declare independence from the crumbling communist empire. Since then, Ukraine has sought to align closely with the European Union (EU) and NATO, but Moscow has objected to such plans, as it has always considered Ukraine to be part of Russia, and, accordingly, continued to meddle in the country\u2019s internal affairs. In fact, Ukraine became a battleground in 2014 when Putin decided to annex Crimea, which he called the \u201cspiritual source\u201d of the Russian state, and, since then, tensions between the two countries have been very hard to diffuse. In your own view, what\u2019s really behind the conflict between Russia and Ukraine?",
    "output": "There\u2019s more to add, of course. What happened in 2014, whatever one thinks of it, amounted to a coup with U.S. support that replaced the Russia-oriented government by a Western-oriented one. That led Russia to annex Crimea, mainly to protect its sole warm water port and naval base, and apparently with the agreement of a considerable majority of the Crimean population. There\u2019s extensive scholarship on the complexities, particularly Richard Sakwa\u2019sFrontline Ukraineand more recent work. There\u2019s an excellent discussion of the current situation in a recent article inThe Nationby Anatol Lieven. Lieven argues realistically that Ukraine is \u201cthe most dangerous [immediate] problem in the world,\u201d and \u201calso in principle the most easily solved.\u201d The solution has already been proposed and accepted \u2014 in principle: the Minsk II agreement, adopted by France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine in 2015, and endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council. The agreement tacitly presupposes withdrawal of George W. Bush\u2019s invitation to Ukraine to join NATO, reaffirmed by Barack Obama, vetoed by France and Germany, an outcome that no Russian leader is likely to accept. It calls for disarmament of the separatist Russia-oriented region (Donbas) and withdrawal of Russian forces (\u201cvolunteers\u201d), and spells out the key elements of settlement, with \u201cthree essential and mutually dependent parts: demilitarization; a restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty, including control of the border with Russia; and full autonomy for the Donbas in the context of the decentralization of power in Ukraine as a whole.\u201d Such an outcome, Lieven observes, would not be unlike other federations, including the U.S. Minsk II has not been implemented because of disagreements about timing of its various measures. The issue has been \u201cburied\u201d in U.S. political circles and media, Lieven writes, \u201cbecause of the refusal of Ukrainian governments to implement the solution and the refusal of the United States to put pressure on them to do so.\u201d The U.S., he concludes, has been keeping to \u201ca zombie policy \u2014 a dead strategy that is wandering around pretending to be alive and getting in everyone\u2019s way, because U.S. policy-makers have not been able to bring themselves to bury it.\u201d The imminent dangers make it imperative to bury the policy and adopt a sound one. To overcome the impasse will not be easy, but as Lieven observes, the only alternatives are too horrendous to consider. The essentials are understood: Austrian-style neutrality for Ukraine, which means no military alliances or foreign military bases, and an internal resolution in the general terms of Minsk II. \u201cThe most dangerous problem in the world\u201d can therefore be solved with a modicum of rationality. The broader context reaches back to the collapse of the Soviet Union 30 years ago. There were three contrasting visions of the global order that should be established in the wake of its collapse. All accepted that Germany would be unified and would join NATO \u2014 a remarkable concession by Russia, considering that Germany alone, not part of a hostile military alliance, had virtually destroyed Russia twice in the past century, a third time joining with the West (including the U.S.), in the \u201cintervention\u201d immediately after the Bolsheviks took power. One proposal was Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s: a Eurasian security system from the Atlantic to Vladivostok, with no military blocs. The U.S. never considered that as an option. A second proposal was offered by George H.W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, endorsed by West Germany: NATO would not move \u201cone inch to the East,\u201d meaning East Berlin; nothing beyond was contemplated, at least publicly. The third was Bill Clinton\u2019s: NATO would move all the way to the Russian border, carry out military maneuvers in the states adjoining Russia, and place weapons on the Russian border that the U.S. would certainly regard as offensive weapons in the (inconceivable) event that it would even tolerate anything remotely comparable anywhere in its vicinity. It was the Clinton Doctrine that was implemented. The asymmetry is far more deeply rooted. It is a core component of the \u201crule-based international order\u201d that the U.S. advocates (while by coincidence, setting the rules), replacing the supposedly archaic UN-based international order that bans \u201cthe threat or use of force\u201d in international affairs. The latter condition is unacceptable to rogue states that demand the right to employ the threat of force constantly, and to resort to force at will. An important topic that we have discussed before. One crucial illustration of the rule-based asymmetry that should be familiar is President Kennedy\u2019s response to Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s sending of nuclear missiles to Cuba \u2014 in reaction to the threat of invasion as the culmination of JFK\u2019s terrorist war against Cuba, and to his huge arms buildup in response to Khrushchev\u2019s offer for mutual reduction of offensive weapons even though the U.S. was far in the lead. The critical issue that almost led to devastating war was the status of U.S. nuclear-armed missiles aimed at Russia in Turkey. As the crisis moved ominously close to war, the key issue was whether the missiles should be publicly withdrawn (as Khrushchev requested) or only secretly (as Kennedy demanded). In fact, the U.S. had already ordered them withdrawn to be replaced by far more menacing Polaris submarines, so there was no withdrawal at all, only escalation. The crucial asymmetry is presupposed, an inviolable principle of world order, established more extensively as the Clinton\u2019s NATO Doctrine was imposed. It should be recalled that this was only one component of a more expansive Clinton Doctrine, which accords the U.S. the right to use military force \u201cunilaterally when necessary\u201d to defend vital interests such as \u201censuring uninhibited access to key markets, energy supplies and strategic resources.\u201d No one else can claim such a right. There is extensive scholarly debate about the status of the Bush-Baker proposal. The agreement was only verbal, as argued in justification when Washington instantly violated it, moving troops to East Berlin. But the basic facts are not seriously in doubt."

    "input": "NATO was founded in response to the alleged threat posed to Western democracies by the Soviet Union. Yet, NATO not only didnotdisappear after the end of the Cold War, but continued its expansion eastwards and, as a matter of fact, regards Ukraine today as a potential member. What is the relevance of NATO today, and to what extent is it responsible for escalating tensions on Russia\u2019s borders and for potentially ushering in a new Cold War?",
    "output": "The expansion to the East, including regular military maneuvers and threatening weapons systems, is clearly a factor in escalating tensions, the offer to Ukraine to join NATO even more so, as just discussed. In thinking about the acutely dangerous current situation, it\u2019s useful to bear in mind the founding of NATO and the \u201calleged threat.\u201d There\u2019s a good deal to say about that topic, specifically about how the Russian threat was actually perceived by planners. Inquiry shows that it was quite different from the fevered rhetoric employed \u201cto scare the hell out of the country\u201d in a manner \u201cclearer than truth\u201d (Sen. Arthur Vandenberg and Dean Acheson, respectively). It is well-known that the influential planner George Kennan considered the Russian threat to be political and ideological, not military. He was, in fact, sent out to pasture early on for failure to join in the largely manufactured panic. Still, it\u2019s always instructive to see how the world is perceived at the dovish extreme. As head of the State Department planning staff, Kennan was so concerned about the threat from postwar Russia in 1946 that he felt that partition of Germany might be necessary in violation of wartime agreements. The reason was the need to \u201crescue Western zones of Germany by walling them off against Eastern penetration,\u201d not, of course, by military force, but by \u201cpolitical penetration,\u201d where the Russians had the advantage. In 1948, Kennan advised that, \u201cThe problem of Indonesia [is] the most crucial issue of the moment in our struggle with the Kremlin,\u201d even though the Kremlin was nowhere in sight. The reason was that if Indonesia falls under \u201cCommunism\u201d it could be an \u201cinfection [that] would sweep westward\u201d through all of South Asia, even endangering U.S. control of the Middle East. The internal record is littered with similar illustrations of oblique, sometimes quite explicit, recognition of reality. In general, \u201cThe Kremlin\u201d became a metaphor for anything that might fall out of U.S. control \u2014 until 1949, when the \u201cSino-Soviet conspiracy\u201d could sometimes fill the bill. Russia was indeed a threat, within its Eastern European domains, just as many around the world can attest to threats of the U.S. and its Western allies. There should be no need to sample that awful history. NATO had little role in it. With the collapse of the USSR, the official justification for NATO was gone, and something new had to be devised. More generally, some new pretext had to be devised for violence and subversion. One device, quickly seized upon, was \u201chumanitarian intervention.\u201d This was soon framed within the doctrine of \u201cResponsibility to Protect\u201d (R2P). Two versions were formulated. The official version was adopted by the UN in 2005. It keeps to the strictures of the UN Charter banning the threat or use of force in international affairs apart from conditions irrelevant to R2P, proceeding beyond only in calling on states to observe humanitarian law. That\u2019s the official version of R2P. A second version was formulated by the Report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty on Responsibility to Protect (2001), produced under the initiative of former Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans. It departs from the official version in one crucial respect: a situation in which \u201cthe Security Council rejects a proposal or fails to deal with it in a reasonable time.\u201d In that case, the Report authorizes \u201caction within area of jurisdiction by regional or sub-regional organizations under Chapter VIII of the Charter, subject to their seeking subsequent authorization from the Security Council.\u201d In practice, the right to intervene is reserved to the powerful \u2014 in today\u2019s world, to the NATO powers, which are also unilaterally able to determine their own \u201carea of jurisdiction.\u201d They did in fact do so. NATO unilaterally determined that its \u201carea of jurisdiction\u201d includes the Balkans, then Afghanistan, and well beyond. NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer instructed a NATO meeting in June 2007 that, \u201cNATO troops have to guard pipelines that transport oil and gas that is directed for the West,\u201d and more generally have to protect sea routes used by tankers and other \u201ccrucial infrastructure\u201d of the energy system. NATO\u2019s area of jurisdiction is therefore worldwide. To be sure, some do not agree; in particular, the traditional victims of the kind tutelage of Europe and its offshoots. Their opinion, as always dismissed, was made explicit in the first meeting of the South Summit of 133 states (April 2000). Its declaration, surely with the recent bombing of Serbia in mind, rejected \u201cthe so-called \u2018right\u2019 of humanitarian intervention, which has no legal basis in the United Nations Charter or in the general principles of international law.\u201d The wording of the declaration reaffirms earlier UN declarations to the same effect, and is mirrored in the official version of R2P. Standard practice since has been to refer to the official UN version as justification for whatever is done but to keep to the Evans Commission version for determination of choice of action."

While it is not likely that NATO would intervene militarily in a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, a Russian invasion of Ukraine would surely bring about a dramatic transformation of the international landscape. What would be the most realistic solution to the Ukraine conflict?",
    "output": "The indications are real, and ominous. Most serious analysts doubt that Putin would launch an invasion. He would have a great deal to lose \u2014 maybe everything if the U.S. reacted with force, as we all might. At best from his perspective, Russia would be engaged in a bitter \u201cendless war\u201d and subjected to very severe sanctions and other harsh measures. I presume that Putin\u2019s intention is to warn the West not to disregard what he takes to be Russian interests, with some justice. There is a realistic solution: the one that Anatol Lieven outlined. As he discusses, it is not easy to imagine another one. And none has been proposed. Fortunately, this solution is within reach. It is of great importance to keep popular opinion from being inflamed by all-too familiar devices that have led to catastrophe in the past."

The very general question I would ask right away is, do you get the sense that the United States, as a global empire and as a geopolitical force in the world, is it expanding, is it a stable entity, or is it in decline? What is your general sense based on the trends of what\u2019s going on in that realm?",
    "output": "Well, if we look over the long term, the United States has been in decline since 1945. The U.S. had reached the peak of its power in 1945 at the end of the Second World War. In fact, [it\u2019s] a level of power that had never existed in world history, the United States\u2019 control. It was far and away the richest country in the world [and] had gained enormously through the war. Industrial production quadrupled. The United States was, of course, untouched by the war. Its rivals had been seriously harmed or destroyed. It had probably 40 to 50 percent of world wealth. Statistics weren\u2019t very good in those days, but something roughly like that. Security was incomparable. [The U.S.] controlled the western hemisphere, controlled both oceans, controlled the opposite sides of both oceans. It was just incomparable, but it started to decline right away. The first step was in 1949 when China became independent. In the United States, that\u2019s called \u201closs of China,\u201d which is a pretty revealing expression. It was just known that we owned the world and the loss of China was a terrible event. It goes on. By the 1970s, the world economy was pretty much tripolar with U.S.-based North America, German-based Europe, and at that time, Japan-based Northeast Asia (already the most dynamic region, without leaving out China and the East Asian Tigers). The U.S. share of global income had declined to maybe 25 percent, which is still enormous, but not like in 1945. If we proceed further, pretty much the same tendencies. I mean, militarily, of course, the U.S. is just totally incomparable. No other country has 800 military bases around the world, nobody has even a dozen. If you look at global power, the U.S. is incomparable. You can see it very clearly in the use of sanctions. No other country can impose sanctions. The U.S. can impose sanctions wherever it wants and it forces other countries to adhere to them, because the U.S. controls the global financial system. There\u2019s another change that\u2019s taken place during the neoliberal globalization process. The national income, which is what is usually measured, doesn\u2019t mean as much as it used to. A different measure which may be more insightful of global power is the amount of global wealth owned by domestically based multinationals. And if you look at those figures, it\u2019s astonishing. U.S. based multinationals control about half of all the world\u2019s wealth, and by now the statistics are good. They\u2019re first in practically every category. This is changing somewhat under Trump\u2019s wrecking ball. We don\u2019t know exactly how that\u2019ll work out, but it\u2019s fundamentally the same. So yes, the U.S. is still the dominant global power, but it has limits that it didn\u2019t have in the past."

The United States pulled out of \u2014 well, I shouldn\u2019t say that it pulled out of Syria, but it withdrew support of the Kurds, of the people of northern Syria, which is a rather controversial move. There was a lot of blowback or reaction to that decision. I wanted to get your sense of whether other world powers are coming in and filling in the role that the United States played particularly in Syria, and maybe in other regions around the world as well, which can be an indication of the U.S. military\u2019s lack of control that it may have once had in these regions. So, maybe using Syria as a specific example, what do you make of that?",
    "output": "Well, first of all, Trump\u2019s sudden withdrawal of a small U.S. contingent in the Kurdish dominated areas and his invitation to Turkey to expand their aggression and atrocities against the Kurds, that was a grotesque betrayal, and not the first. There\u2019s a long history of it. Now the Kurds in Syria are basically handed over to their main enemies, Turkey and Assad\u2019s Syria. The Russians stepped in and are in control. [Trump] basically invited Russia to intervene, to be the moderate power that tried to calm things down and to some extent, they\u2019re doing it. The United States didn\u2019t leave Northeast Syria, they just moved troops to the oil producing regions. The number of troops is about the same. Other troops went to Iraq right across the border, and the Iraqi government didn\u2019t want them there. If you look back a couple of years to around 2011 and 2012, the United States and other Western powers assumed that it would be possible to overthrow the Assad regime, and not just them, but the Gulf states, too \u2014 and they were all intervening, supporting their local allies, pouring arms in in an effort to overthrow the Assad regime. The CIA sent advanced weapons to the groups they were supporting, anti-tank weapons, and that did succeed in stopping Assad\u2019s forces. But quite predictably, it brought the Russians in. In 2015, the Russians intervened and neutralized the U.S. weapons. The U.S./Gulf [states] supported, by then, mostly jihadi-based elements. And Russia \u2014 the U.S. was not going to counter Russia, it could lead to a nuclear war. So, they sort of pulled back and Assad has slowly, with Russian and Iranian aid, reconquered most of the country. There are some parts that are not yet under Assad\u2019s control. And they leave most of the problems, most of the ISIS and other jihadi groups located in the Northeast Syria, which is under Kurdish control \u2014 that would probably now be abandoned to some combination of Assad and Turkey with Russia being [another ] external force. There are more U.S. troops remaining in the South, but in effect, Trump did authorize Turkey, Russia, and Iran to expand their [influence]. This was strongly opposed by the U.S. military and diplomatic centers, not for good reasons in my opinion. But anyway, those under President Trump obviously will keep shifting around terms. But in general, the U.S. is very far from withdrawing troops from the region. In fact, while all this is going on, Trump sent thousands of additional troops to Saudi Arabia to support their murderous war in Yemen. So, it\u2019s very far from withdrawal from the Middle East. There is kind of a geostrategic strategy, in the background: to construct an alliance of the most reactionary states in the region \u2014 the Gulf dictatorships, Sisi\u2019s Egypt \u2014 a brutal dictatorship. Israel, which has moved very far to the right \u2014 its alliance with the Gulf states has become more evident in the last couple years, especially under Trump. And to link this alliance with other reactionary forces, Modi in India, some of the so-called illiberal democracies in Europe, in Orban\u2019s Hungary or Salvini\u2019s Italy and so on. This is incidentally described fairly openly and frankly by Steve Bannon, who\u2019s kind of in the background as an advisor. But that\u2019s what\u2019s been taking shape as a kind of a base for U.S. power in the region with many uncertainties as to how it will develop. But the general point is the U.S. is not withdrawing from what Trump calls endless wars. Still, deeply involved in them."

I want to point to Julian Assange, at least at first, and get your thoughts on what\u2019s currently unfolding with him. He is in Belmarsh Prison in London. He\u2019s been there since April, since he was forcibly removed from the Ecuadorian Embassy and the asylum that he had there. There was recently a report that came out [of a recent court appearance]. The report says that he was fighting back tears, that he couldn\u2019t think properly, that he couldn\u2019t understand the court proceedings. He had a hard time even recalling, I think, his own name, the date even. What do you make of this case, and not just of Assange, but also how the U.S. media in particular has covered what\u2019s happening to Assange,WikiLeaks, and whistleblowing in general?",
    "output": "[It\u2019s the] U.S. media and the British media, as well. Assange basically is being murdered by the British government. His being sequestered in the Ecuadorian Embassy was bad enough. The embassy (incidentally I visited him there) is kind of like a small apartment. He was basically stuck in a couple, one or two rooms. In many ways it\u2019s worse than being in prison, at least prisoners are allowed to go into the yard and see the sun. He couldn\u2019t go out. It was plainly psychologically very difficult, it would be for anyone. Now after the rightwing government in Ecuador expelled him, he was taken over by the British. He\u2019s in a high security prison under very harsh conditions. All of this for the crime of skipping bail.... And his treatment, the people that have seen him at that court scene that you mentioned say that his health is sharply deteriorating. He\u2019s being treated in a way which is basically destroying him. There is an extradition hearing coming up. How it\u2019ll turn out, we don\u2019t know. The British will probably extradite [him] to the United States, where he\u2019ll be tried for crimes that, even theoretically, can lead to the death sentence, which he\u2019s already practically suffering [from] now. And as for the media, they\u2019re simply supporting this, or even not reporting it, or saying, \u201cyeah, it\u2019s the right thing because he\u2019s a hideous criminal who revealed to the world the things that the U.S. government doesn\u2019t want populations to know.\u201d Meanwhile, the same media eagerly exploit the revelations that come out fromWikiLeaks. So, that\u2019s basically what I have to say about Assange."

I mean there are gross violations of international law that nobody even mentions. So, in this century, the most extreme violation of international law was the U.S./U.K. invasion of Iraq. That\u2019s a textbook example of aggression with no credible pretext. It\u2019s what the Nuremberg Tribunal [and in] general International Law regard as the supreme international crime, differing from other war crimes in that it encompasses the totality of what happens then and afterwards. [This] includes the creation of the breakup of Iraq, the killing of hundreds of thousands of people, [generating] millions of refugees, inciting ethnic conflicts, which are tearing the whole region apart, leading to the birth of ISIS and so on.

I really think about what it means to be a journalist in an authoritarian state and what the real risks that come with doing real journalism are right now. It\u2019s rather bleak, I guess. For people that are getting into journalism right now, what they can expect? What they\u2019re coming up against?",
    "output": "Well, you know, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s crossed a border, we\u2019ve been through much worse in the past. So take Woodrow Wilson\u2019s Red Scare in 1919, right after the First World War. I mean, thousands of people were deported. The independent press was virtually crushed. There was a massive attack on human rights. The so-called McCarthy period was bad enough even though not that severe. The Trump period is innovating in a way which is familiar from totalitarian states. The entire system in the United States under Trump is becoming a kind of proto-fascism without the ideology, just the appurtenances of fascism. One of those is to totally destroy the information system so that the concept of truth, fact, accuracy just fades into oblivion. And the way they\u2019re doing it is just by flooding the information system with fakery, perfectly conscious lying and deceit on every imaginable topic, trivial or important, to the point where people have to sort of abandon the effort to try to find out what\u2019s true or false. Of course, you can still do it if you work at it. But for much of the population, it means that the whole concept of accuracy, truth, fact and so on, kind of dissolves. Well, that\u2019s a very effective way of undermining public engagement in many of the decisions that matter in the world. In other words, it\u2019s destroying democratic functions. And Trump is a master at it, and that\u2019s working very well. He\u2019s got an adoring constituency where he can do no wrong. Facts are what he says. They\u2019re maybe about forty percent of the population or more, very solid base. The Republican Party is terrified of that base, won\u2019t do anything to cross Trump, he\u2019s their God. Some sectors of it, like evangelicals, who are a big segment of the population in the United States, are almost totally in line in support of their [leader] and so on. It\u2019s wrong to describe this as fascism. Gives it too much credit, it has basically no ideology. The ideology for Trump is just Me. Whatever is important for me. But it has some of the features of totalitarian systems [with] undermining of the media, creating anger and distrust regarding the media as some kind of enemy. That\u2019s a good way to undermine democratic functioning. That\u2019s happened for sure. This interview was recorded and released in audio form Nov. 7th, 2019.

First of all, does Trump think that? Probably not. Is there any truth to it? There isn\u2019t a particle of truth to any of it. The most repressive countries in the Middle East are the ones we support. By comparison to Saudi Arabia, Iran looks like Norway, you know.

But it made me think about Trump. Are we at another one of those key pivotal moments featuring a president with a trigger finger, and more and more nations with nuclear weapons?",
    "output": "Well, you know, Trump is a deviation from standard political history. He doesn\u2019t even consider geostrategic issues. He doesn\u2019t care what the hell he\u2019s doing. If he smashes up the international economy, fine. If he throws out NATO, who cares? The only thing he cares about is himself, literally, and everything he\u2019s doing follows from just the recognition that he\u2019s a narcissistic megalomaniac who wants to make sure that, you know, he\u2019s on top. He wins everything. And he has to keep his base under control. And he\u2019s very good at it. He knows exactly what buttons to push to maintain his angry following. He\u2019s shafting them at every turn. Just take a look at wages. Since he\u2019s come in, real wages have declined. They were actually starting to rise under Obama, and they\u2019re starting to decline. But he\u2019s keeping them in line. And the way he does it, by just doing one crazed thing after another, which looks as though he\u2019s defending us. And they\u2019re passionate. They revere him. So, you take a look\u2014and on nuclear weapons, actually he\u2019s got the best position of any politician in the country. He\u2019s saying we should reduce tensions with Russia. And he\u2019s making moves to allow the Koreans to move slowly towards denuclearization, and it\u2019s perfect. And that\u2019s what everyone, including the Democrats, is denouncing him for."

For one thing, it was top down. He was seriously interested in creating grass roots organizations, but you can\u2019t do that from the top. They have to grow out of something in the community. You can\u2019t order a popular revolution. So, it was always very flimsy. The other thing is, he never moved to diversify the economy, and that\u2019s lethal. And it ended up with 95 percent of the economy, based on oil. And so as soon as the oil prices dropped, everything collapsed. The other thing is he\u2014he wasn\u2019t corrupt himself, which is pretty rare in Latin America, but he tolerated a lot of corruption. So, the thing was pretty rotten all the way through.

I mean, what\u2019s his name\u2014Wheelock, the Minister of Agriculture, he was a militant Sandinista. He became one of the biggest landowners in Nicaragua. My daughter lived there for years. Her husband\u2019s Nicaraguan. We went to visit once; right in a residential area there\u2019s a huge wall which surrounds a big area in central Managua. Inside it is an estate owned by Humberto Ortega [brother of Daniel Ortega], who lives in Costa Rica where he\u2019s a rich businessman. You have to look at their mentality. The guys who are the Sandinista leadership, not the fighters, but the leadership, they came from the Nicaraguan elite. Their feeling was, \u201cLook, we should have it now. We should have what those guys had.\u201d And they took it, you know. They\u2019re very authoritarian, and a lot of corruption all the way through. So now it\u2019s beginning to collapse. I remember great optimism in the \u201880s regarding Nicaragua, and I don\u2019t see any cause for optimism in Latin America right now. Well, Nicaragua was a very exciting place in the early \u201880s, but the U.S. \u2013 one of the great Reagan achievements was to destroy hope, literally. By the time he got to the late \u201880s, people had basically just given up. We can\u2019t fight this. I could see it even in simple ways; my daughter lived in a fairly poor area in Managua, \u2014 not deeply poor, but by our standards, very poor. There was a park there which had playground equipment which was all rusted. So, the kids in the neighborhood couldn\u2019t use it. They couldn\u2019t use the sliding boards. And half the people that live in the neighborhood are, welders, machinists, and so on. They could have taken out an afternoon and fixed up the playground equipment so their own kids could have a place to play, but they\u2019re just sitting in the bar drinking, they\u2019d just given up hope. The Contras war was very effective that way. It\u2019s very hard to withstand something like brutal sanctions, terrorist war from the biggest thug on the block \u2013 it\u2019s not easy. It was a major U.S. success."

That began to erode soon with what is called \u201cthe loss of China\u201d, which had major effects on the world scene. As other industrial societies recovered from wartime devastation and decolonisation took its agonising course, global society became more diverse. By the early 1970s, the core of the global economy was becoming tripolar: U.S.-based North America, German-based Europe, and Japan-based north-east Asia, already the most dynamic region. And there has been further erosion particularly since the rise of China, by now the world\u2019s largest economy by some realistic measures\u2014though still a poor country with severe internal problems. In some dimensions, notably military, the U.S. remains supreme. And it should also be borne in mind that with the globalisation of the international economy, national accounts are less significant than before. Thus, while the U.S\u2019 share of global domestic product is estimated at less than 20 per cent, U.S.-based firms control about half the world\u2019s wealth.

The Marxist thinker Professor Samir Amin explains this growth as the phenomenon of \u201cthe return of fascism in contemporary capitalism\u201d. Do you share this fear that fascist ascendency is on the horizon?",
    "output": "Like most terms of political discourse, the term \u201cfascism\u201d is imprecise. By now it has taken on the connotation of utterly abominable, as is natural given the practices of the fascist regimes and organisations. Long ago, the term was used in a more precise technical sense, for example, by the outstanding Veblenite political economist Robert Brady, who described the state of capitalist societies quite generally as having fascist tendencies through the 1930s. By now the term may be more misleading than instructive. The growth of right-wing forces today is ominous enough without this terminology, and should be analysed in its own terms, as part of the general collapse of the centrist political institutions during the neoliberal period, evident in recent elections in the industrial democracies. The rise of the Far Right is one manifestation of this process, as is the rise of popular movements and political organisations that seek to carry social democratic policies further. One important example is the [Bernie] Sanders movement in the U.S. The most remarkable feature of the November 2016 election in the U.S. was not the election of a billionaire whose campaign was lavishly funded and had extensive media support, even though he departed sharply from the style of the Republican establishment. Rather, it was the Sanders campaign, which broke with a long political tradition of largely bought elections. As shown particularly by the political economist Thomas Ferguson\u2019s important work, campaign funding alone\u2014one of many elements of private power\u2014is a powerful determinant of electability. Sanders had no funding from private wealth or corporate power, no media support, and even used the word \u201csocialism\u201d, a scare word in U.S. political discourse. He would probably have won the Democratic Party nomination, maybe the election, had it not been for the machinations of party managers, and emerged as by far the most popular political figure in the country. That is another manifestation of the (well-founded) popular antagonism towards centrist institutions and their policies during the neoliberal era, developments mirrored elsewhere as well, for example, by [Jeremy] Corbyn\u2019s takeover of the British Labour Party and by DiEM25 on the continent. What is taking place is reminiscent of Gramsci\u2019s observations about an earlier period, when \u201cthe old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear\u201d. But also, we may add, signs of hope."

    "input": "\u201cManufacturing Consent\u201d, the book published by you and Edward S. Herman in 1988, exposed magisterially how the mass media manufactures consent for the ruling class. However, after the publication of the book, a lot of changes have taken place in the media world. The increasing growth of the Internet has substantially decreased the weight of traditional monopoly control over news and information. Some believe that social media and online media platforms provide the prospects of \u201cliberation\u201d. How do you assess the changed media landscape?",
    "output": "We published a second edition of the book in 2002, when the Internet was already widely used, but saw no need for change. We had been in contact recently about the matter and felt much the same way. There have, of course, been changes, but the institutional factors that influence media performance do not seem to be materially different. The mainstream media remain the major source of news and information, with all their advantages and all their flaws. The Internet makes it possible to access a wider range of sources, for those who wish to devote the effort to that. It certainly is quite helpful for research. Unfortunately, there is little sign that this far more extensive access to information and opinion has led generally to greater enlightenment and understanding. Often, the opposite seems the case. There definitely are prospects of liberation, but it is necessary to take advantage of them, and it is often easy to retreat to superficial comfort zones restricted to what one wants to hear rather than exploring the wide range of possibilities made available by the new technology."

It was carefully designed to avoid any contact with the Russians, possibly with collaborative planning. The attack is unlikely to have any effect on the war, or on the continued and massive atrocities of the Syrian government. The major media have been largely suppressing the fact that Russia and Syria called at once for an on-site investigation by the international monitors, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which at once scheduled an inquiry (though there was enormous coverage of a delay). The attack took place just as the monitors were arriving for an inspection. There is mounting evidence, also mostly suppressed by the media (or ridiculed, while ignoring the sources) that the main target that was destroyed might have been a medical research facility producing antibodies. If that turns out to be verified, it will be similar to the criminal atrocity of [Bill] Clinton\u2019s destruction of the main pharmaceutical plant in Sudan [al-Shifa]. Right now, much remains obscure, and may remain so."

    "output": "It is useful to read the arguments presented for withdrawing from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action [JCPOA]. They are so ludicrous that those who provided the President with them cannot possibly believe them and were probably laughing when he read the script. The real reasons are not hard to discern. Trump is often described as unpredictable. In fact, he is highly predictable. He has one leading principle: \u201cME, ME, ME!\u201d One corollary is that he has to keep his base fired up, the other, closely related, is that he has to do the opposite of whatever was done by the evil black demon [Barack] Obama, probably not even American, possibly even anti-Christ, as a quarter of the Republicans believe. review of his policies will show that this script is followed with great precision. Withdrawing from the JCPOA is one illustration. Obama was responsible for it; therefore, it is a hideous attack on the U.S. and must go. Damn the consequences. The same is true of his withdrawal from the Paris negotiations and the race to destroy the environment in which organised human life can persist. And consistently through the rest of his policy decisions. secondary Trump principle is that wealth and privilege must be lavished on his real constituency, the very rich and the corporate sector. The technique here is very simple. Trump\u2019s regular antics attract constant media attention, the more absurd and outlandish the better. Meanwhile, the more savage wing of the Republican party rams through legislation serving the interests of the real constituency, kicking the rest in the face, including Trump\u2019s working-class supporters (most of the Trump voters are relatively affluent or very affluent, and have little objection to these policies). Again, the record is very clear and remarkably consistent. It is entirely possible that Trump will be clever enough to accept the plea of the two Koreas that he leaves them alone to settle their problems \u201con their own accord\u201d, without interference, as they requested in the historic Declaration of Panmunjom a few days ago [April 27, 2018]. Then he can prance around in public claiming to have made the deal of the century, where the black demon failed. If that happens, at least one major international problem might move towards resolution, though the severe dangers in the Middle East are likely to escalate. It\u2019s entirely possible that Israel will see Trump\u2019s latest assault against humanity as a green light to escalate its regular bombing of Syria. Sooner or later, Russia may respond by providing more advanced anti-aircraft defences, which Israel will surely move to destroy. That could lead to a confrontation with Russia which, so far, both sides have been careful to try to avoid. The consequences could be horrendous, and those are not the only grim possibilities. But all of this is of no concern for Trump, just as the race to destruction of the environment is of no concern. What is important is more wealth and power tomorrow, for himself and the real constituency\u2014and \u201capres moi le deluge\u201d. Literally, in this case."

And despite the COVID-19 crisis, Donald Trump\u2019s popularity actually rose in March. Do you think this will impact the US election?",
    "output": "It is worth taking a step back to look at the roots of the pandemic. It is not unexpected. After the SARS epidemic of 2003, scientists anticipated that another pandemic is very likely, probably a variant of the SARS coronavirus. But knowledge is not enough. Someone must do something about it. The drug companies are not interested. They follow market signals, and profits lie elsewhere. The government could take over, but that is blocked by neoliberal doctrine. Trump made it worse by steadily defunding the Centres for Disease Control and eliminating government programs that would have provided advance notice, so the US was singularly unprepared. Chinese scientists very quickly identified the virus that was causing the illness, sequenced the genome, and by January 10 made all the relevant information public. number of countries reacted at once and have pretty much contained the problem. Trump ignored the regular warnings by US intelligence and health officials, insisting that it was just the flu and would disappear. By the time he finally paid attention, in March, it was far too late. Tens of thousands of Americans had already died and the pandemic was out of control. So the US suffered a triple blow: capitalist logic, the savage neoliberal variant of capitalism, and a government that has no concern for the population. When a president takes a stand, there is always a gain in approval, but in Trump\u2019s case it quickly waned. His bungling and criminality will probably weaken his re-election chances, but a lot can happen before November."

The beneficiaries of the savage capitalism of the past 40 years of neoliberalism, who are also largely responsible for the current pandemic and much more, are working relentlessly to ensure that the outcome will be an even harsher version of the system they have constructed for their own benefit. If there are no powerful counter forces, they will succeed. But it is not foreordained. Popular forces are taking shape that could create a very different and much better world. That is even happening at an international level with the formation of Progressive International, initiated by a call from [Bernie] Sanders in the US and Yanis Varoufakis in Europe, now also including the Global South. We should bear in mind that as severe as this crisis is, there is worse coming. There will be recovery from the pandemic, at terrible cost. There will be no recovery from the melting of the polar ice sheets, the glaciers in the Himalayas or the other dire effects of global warming \u2013 which will render much of South Asia uninhabitable if the world persists on its present course, and not in the distant future.

Would you agree?",
    "output": "Most of this is the ugly face of the Trump administration and their unusually vicious form of imperialism. But there is more, and it is quite revealing. Consider the European Union \u2013 note,Union. Its richest and most powerful country is Germany, which is handling the crisis reasonably well. Not far to its south is a country that is suffering severely from the pandemic: Italy. Is Germany providing health services to Italy? Not so far as has been reported. Fortunately, Italy is receiving substantial help from Cuba. That is an illustration of true internationalism, not for the first time. The circumstances illustrate the kind of internationalism that is desperately needed \u2013 and the kind of selfishness that may destroy us all. Trump, no doubt, is inflicting serious harm on the United States, but even he is unlikely to seriously damage US hegemony, I suspect. US power remains overwhelming. In the military domain, it is beyond comparison. The US is the only country that can impose harsh sanctions \u2013 third party sanctions which others obey no matter how much they oppose them. When the US releases its \u201cdeal of the century\u201d for Israel-Palestine, it becomes the framework to which others adapt. If any other country had released it, the reaction would have been ridicule, if anyone had even noticed. US-based multinationals control half the world\u2019s wealth and rank first or sometimes second in just about every economic category. Others increasingly dislike the US, or worse.

No need to go through the whole history, but back in 1954, the U.S. intervened, sponsored a military coup, overthrew a mildly reformist elected government. Since then, the country has been a complete horror story\u2014hundreds of thousands of people killed, all kinds of atrocities, every imaginable sort of torture. It peaked in the 1980s under Reagan. In fact, some of the places where people are fleeing from, the Mayan areas, there was literal genocide going on, carried out by the man who Reagan called a stellar exponent of democracy, a really good guy. When Congress imposed some limits on direct U.S. military aid to this\u2014to R\u00edos Montt, the person who was\u2014general who was implementing the genocidal attacks, Reagan set up an international terrorist network. The U.S. does not hire terrorists, it hires terror states\u2014it\u2019s much more effective\u2014so, Taiwan, Israel, Argentina\u2014as long as it was under the rule of the neo-Nazi generals. Unfortunately, they were overthrown. They had the good news, Argentina. The people are still fleeing from the destruction there. It\u2019s been a horror story ever since. Same with El Salvador, where about 70,000 people were killed during the 1980s, almost all by the security forces, armed, trained, directed by the United States. Again, horror story since. In Honduras, which not long ago had the plurality of refugees, the refugee flow started to peak after a military coup threw out the elected government, the Zelaya government, condemned by the entire hemisphere and the world, with the usual exception of President Obama. Hillary Clinton refused to call it a military coup, because that would have meant terminating military aid to the junta, which the U.S. continued to do. There had always been a severe repression and atrocities. They mounted sharply. Honduras became maybe the homicide capital of the world, and refugees started fleeing. There were so-called elections, which were mocked by almost everyone except the United States. It continues. You\u2019ll notice there\u2019s one\u2014there\u2019s two countries in the region from which there haven\u2019t been refugee flows. One is Costa Rica, which happens to be the one country that sort of functions, and not by accident, the one country that the United States has not\u2014in which the United States does not intervene militarily to overthrow the government and run a military regime. The other is Nicaragua, which differed, which also suffered severely in the 1980s from Reagan\u2019s assaults. But Nicaragua was unlike the other countries of the region: It had an army to defend it. In the other countries, the army were the terrorists. In Nicaragua, the army could, to some extent, defend the population from Reagan\u2019s terrorist forces. And though there\u2019s plenty of problems in Nicaragua, it hasn\u2019t been the source of refugee flow. So, essentially, what President Trump is saying is, we\u2019ll destroy your countries, slaughter you, impose brutal regimes, but if you try to get out, you\u2019re not going to come here, because America is full."

Sanders has made the tactical decision, which some criticize but I think is correct, to join the Joe Biden campaign and push it to the left. His associates are working on planning commissions, and in fact, if you look at the program that\u2019s emerged, it\u2019s further to the left than anything since FDR. It offers lots of opportunities. Now, this didn\u2019t happen by magic. It happened kind of like the Green New Deal. It happened by constant pressure and activism.

    "output": "First of all, we should think a little bit of the history. Why is this issue arising now? Is it new? No. It\u2019s been the norm for decades, but it was always targeting the Left, so nobody paid attention to it. Way beyond anything that\u2019s happening now: meetings being broken up, violently disrupted; talks canceled; books destroyed. So, for example, the first book you mentioned,Manufacturing Consent, the first book that Ed Herman and I worked on together, was in the early \u201970s. The book was published by a very successful publisher; twenty thousand copies were printed. The publisher was owned by a big corporation, and one of the executives in the corporation saw the book, was horrified, and demanded that the publisher withdraw it from publication. When they refused, he destroyed the entire publisher. All of its stock was destroyed, to prevent it from distributing the book of errors. Did anybody care? Out of curiosity, I brought it to the attention of leading civil libertarians, like Nat Hentoff and the ACLU, but they didn\u2019t see any problem. It\u2019s not state censorship if a corporation decides to destroy a publisher and destroy all of its stock to keep some book from appearing. In fact, it was hard to find [inaudible] about the person who found something wrong with it. But that\u2019s not the only time. I could give you other cases of mine where books were withdrawn from publication, and I was asked to return the advance, because it had some political content that the publisher didn\u2019t like. Other people have been fired, and faculty positions eliminated, and so on. They didn\u2019t care. It wasn\u2019t censorship \u2014 it was directed against the Left, vastly beyond anything that\u2019s going on today. Now, that doesn\u2019t justify what\u2019s going on today. First of all, I really wouldn\u2019t call it the Left \u2014 when theNew York Timeswithdraws an op-ed, which I don\u2019t think they should have done, it\u2019s pretty hard to call that the Left. When a lot of young people decide to de-platform some speaker, I think they\u2019re making a bad mistake, even from a tactical point of view. There are much better ways to deal with it \u2014 you can run a counter-session, where you expose what\u2019s going on and use it as an educational opportunity. I think it\u2019s wrong in principle and it\u2019s tactically wrong. It\u2019s a gift to the far right; they love it."

    "input": "MB: One of the many pieces of activism that I\u2019ve appreciated immensely that you\u2019ve been involved with was your advocating for President Lula da Silva of Brazil when he was apolitical prisoner. You visited him when he was in prison in Curitiba. Can you tell us why you think President Lula is such an important leader?",
    "output": "President Lula came from a working-class background, was an activist \u2014 in the days of the dictatorship, succeeded in organizing significant opposition and ran for president. He had his victory stolen a couple of times, but he finally won the presidency and initiated a new era in Brazilian history. Don\u2019t take my word for it; take the World Bank \u2014 not a radical institution. In 2016, a couple of years after the end of his term, they published a long study of recent Brazilian economic history. They called Lula\u2019s term in office the \u201cgolden decade\u201d of Brazilian economic history. Enormous reduction of poverty, tremendous increase in inclusion, large parts of the population, blacks and totally marginalized and oppressed people, brought into policies to give people some control over their lives. Tremendous success. Brazil became one of the most respected countries in the world, if not the most respected. Take a look now. It\u2019s an absolute pariah, one of the most ridiculed and condemned countries in the whole world. There were plenty of problems with Lula\u2019s terms. One of them was that he tolerated corruption, didn\u2019t pay attention to it. There was a lot in the Workers\u2019 Party (PT) \u2014 it\u2019s endemic in Brazil, in the entire region. The thing his administration really failed to do was to get people to understand that they were part of the system that was developing. So now it\u2019s quite strange that when people are asked who benefited greatly from Lula\u2019s programs \u2014 when you ask them, \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d they say, \u201cIt came from God,\u201d like it was an accident. They don\u2019t know that it was part of the PT\u2019s programs. That was a real failure of engagement \u2014 that it just \u201ccame to them\u201d somehow and they were not part of it. That was a big failure. There are other things you can criticize. The judgment about the \u201cgolden decade,\u201d I think, is quite right, and the rising to a position of great international respect, as a voice of the Global South, was extremely significant \u2014 and part of the reason for his downfall. Political systems don\u2019t like upstarts. They\u2019re not supposed to do that. The elites in Brazil are extremely racist and class conscious. Here\u2019s this guy who comes from a working-class background, who doesn\u2019t even speak \u201cproper\u201d Portuguese; he didn\u2019t go to the \u201cright\u201d schools. He\u2019s supposed to be humble, grateful for what we do for him \u2014 not up there setting policy. You talk to people and can sense the bitterness and the anger, just for these reasons, even more than the policies. couple years after Lula was out of office, a soft coup was initiated [against Lula\u2019s successor, Dilma Rousseff]. This finally led to the October 2018 election. Lula was jailed; he was the most popular candidate, very likely to win. He was jailed on very dubious charges, but he was also silenced. Unlike a mass murderer on death row, he was not permitted to make a statement. That was very important. He kept quiet during the electoral campaign. Now he\u2019s held on partial release while the appeals were going on. But before the election, they kept him out. What came in was an ultraright fanatic [Jair Bolsonaro] who\u2019s destroying the country. Brazil right now is just on the verge of a military coup. I don\u2019t know if you saw the clips from a couple of days ago, where Bolsonaro gangs were attacking the parliamentary buildings, the Supreme Court, and saying, \u201cGet rid of it.\u201d Bolsonaro fired the heads of the executive divisions, which were looking into his family. His executive statement was that \u201cNobody\u2019s going to fuck around with my family,\u201d which is pretty similar to what just happened here. Bolsonaro sees himself as a kind of clone of [Donald] Trump. Tragedy and farce. Trump is very similar. He just fired all of the inspectors general who were put into place to monitor corruption and malfeasance in executive offices. They were beginning to inquire into this fetid swamp that he\u2019s created in Washington, so he fired them all. And like any tin-pot dictator, he went out of his way to humiliate the senior Republican senator, Charles Grassley, who had spent his career setting this system in implementation. Not a peep from the Republican Party. They\u2019ve disappeared as a party. It\u2019s worse than the old Communist Party. The leader gives an order; we [fall] on our knees."

    "output": "This sounds strong, but it\u2019s true: Trump is the worst criminal in history, undeniably. There has never been a figure in political history who was so passionately dedicated to destroying the projects for organized human life on earth in the near future. That is not an exaggeration. People are focused now on the protests; the pandemic is serious enough that we will emerge from it at terrible cost. The cost is greatly amplified by the gangster in the White House, who has killed tens of thousands of Americans, making this the worst place in the world [for the coronavirus]. We will emerge [from the pandemic, but] we\u2019re not going to emerge from another crime that Trump has committed, the heating of the globe. The worst of it is coming \u2014 we\u2019re not going to emerge from that. The ice sheets are melting; they\u2019re not going to recover. That leads to exponential increase in global warming. Arctic glaciers, for example, could flood the world. Recent studies indicate that on the present course, in about fifty years, much of the habitable part of the world will be unlivable. You won\u2019t be able to live in parts of South Asia, parts of the Middle East, parts of the United States. We\u2019re approaching the point of 125,000 years ago, when sea levels were about twenty-five feet higher than they are now. And it\u2019s worse than that. The Scripps Oceanographic Institute just came out with a study that estimated that we are coming ominously close to a point [similar to] 3 million years ago, when sea levels were fifty to eighty feet higher than they are today."

But there is one country which is led by a president who wants to escalate the crisis, to race toward the abyss, to maximize the use of fossil fuels, including the most dangerous of them, and to dismantle the regulatory apparatus that limits their impact. There is no crime like this in human history. Nothing. This is a unique individual. And it\u2019s not as if he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. Of course he does. It\u2019s as if he doesn\u2019t care. If he can pour more profits into his pockets and the pockets of his rich constituency tomorrow, who cares if the world disappears in a couple of generations?",
    "output": "As far as the government is concerned, we\u2019re seeing something pretty interesting. Parliamentary democracy has been around for 350 years, starting in England in 1689 with the so-called Glorious Revolution, when sovereignty was transferred from the royalty to the parliament. The beginnings of parliamentary democracy in the United States [came] about a century later. Parliamentary democracy is not just based on laws and constitutions. In fact, the British constitution is maybe a dozen words. It\u2019s based on trust and good faith, the assumption that people will act like human beings. Take Richard Nixon. Pretty rotten guy, but when the time came that he had to leave office, he left office quietly. Nobody is expecting that with Trump. He doesn\u2019t act like a human being. He\u2019s off somewhere else. He [doesn\u2019t] even make appointments that can be confirmed by the Senate. Why bother? I don\u2019t like somebody, I\u2019ll throw them out. One Republican, Lisa Murkowski, dares to raise a small question about his nobility, [and he] came down on her with a ton of bricks \u2014 I\u2019m going to destroy you. It\u2019s not fascism. It\u2019s what I said before: tin-pot dictator of some small country where they have coups every couple of years. That\u2019s the mentality. Congress, the Senate, happens to be in the hands of a soul mate of his, Mitch McConnell \u2014 in many ways the real evil genius of this administration, dedicated to destroying democracy long before Trump. When [Barack] Obama was elected, McConnell said openly to the public, \u201cMy main goal is to ensure that Obama can achieve nothing.\u201d Okay. That\u2019s saying, \u201cI want to destroy parliamentary democracy,\u201d which is based, as I said, in good faith and trust in the interchange. The Senate. the so-called world\u2019s greatest deliberative body, is reduced to passing legislation that will enrich the very rich, empowering the corporate sector, and making judicial appointments to stack the judiciary with young, ultraright, mostly incompetent justices who can ensure for a generation that no matter what the public wants, they\u2019ll be able to block it. It\u2019s a deep hatred of democracy and fear of democracy. That\u2019s not unusual among the elites; they don\u2019t like democracy for obvious reasons. But this is something special. That\u2019s on top of the pandemic, on top of the global warming crisis, the crisis of nuclear weapons, which is equally severe. Trump is dismantling the entire arms-control regime, greatly increasing the risk of destruction, virtually inviting enemies to develop weapons to destroy us that we [won\u2019t be able to] stop. Trump is taking the worst aspects of capitalism, particularly the neoliberal version of capitalism, and amplifying them. Let\u2019s justtake the pandemic. Why is there a pandemic? In 2003, after the SARS epidemic, which was a coronavirus, it was well understood by scientists \u2014 they were saying, \u201cAnother coronavirus, much more serious than this, is very likely. Now here are the steps we have to take to prepare for it.\u201d Somebody has to take the steps. Well, there is a pharmaceutical industry, but extraordinarily wealthy, huge labs can\u2019t do it. You don\u2019t spend money on something that might be important ten years from now \u2014 stopping a future catastrophe is not profitable. That\u2019s a capitalist crisis. Government has the resources; they have great labs. But then comes something called Ronald Reagan, at the beginning of the neoliberal assault on the population, arguing that government is the problem, not the solution \u2014 meaning we have to take decisions away from government. Government is influenced by people. Now we have to put [decisions] in the hands of unaccountable private institutions which have no influence from the public. In the United States, that\u2019s sometimes called libertarianism. That\u2019s the beginning of the neoliberal assault. George H. W. Bush established a presidential scientific advisory council board. Obama called it into office, correctly, the first day of his administration and asked them to prepare a pandemic warning reaction system. A couple of weeks later, they came back with a system that was put in place. January 2017, the wrecker comes into office. First days of his administration, [Trump] dismantles the whole system to respond to a pandemic; started defunding the Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention] (CDC) and every health-related aspect of government, year after year. Eliminated programs of American scientists in China working with Chinese scientists to identify potential coronavirus threats and throws it out. So when [the coronavirus] hit, the United States was uniquely unprepared \u2014 thanks to the wrecker. And then it got worse. He refused to react to it. Other countries responded to it, some of them very well and very quickly. It\u2019s almost gone, mostly under control. Not in the United States. He didn\u2019t care. For months, US intelligence couldn\u2019t get the White House to say, \u201cThere\u2019s a serious crisis.\u201d Finally, according to reports, he noticed that the stock market was declining, and then said, \u201cWe have to do something.\u201d What he has done is just chaos. But a large part of the problem is pre-Trump. Why aren\u2019t the hospitals ready? Well, they run on abusiness model. That\u2019s neoliberalism. It has to be just-in-time delivery. They don\u2019t want to lose a cent. So we don\u2019t have an extra hospital bed; we have to make sure the CEOs of the private hospitals get millions of dollars a year in compensation. Can\u2019t have an extra bed \u2014 you cut into that. So everything\u2019s parroted above. Thenursing homes, which are privately owned, are reduced to minimal functioning, because we can make more money that way, if we\u2019re a private-equity corporation that owns them. Now we can contribute to Trump\u2019s campaign so he can have a photo-op with us, telling us how wonderful we are for destroying the nursing homes, killing all the elderly people. It goes deep into issues well before Trump, but he is a unique phenomenon \u2014 again, the worst criminal in human history, so his minor crimes are to destroy American democracy and to amplify a pandemic killing over a hundred thousand people. But those are minor crimes by his standards."

    "input": "Bob, what\u2019s your own take on the IPCC climate assessment report, and do you find anything in it that surprises you?",
    "output": "Robert Pollin:In total, the IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report on the physical basis of climate change is 3,949 pages long. So there\u2019s a whole lot to take in, and I can\u2019t claim to have done more than initially review the 42-page \u201cSummary for Policymakers.\u201d Two things stand out from my initial review. These are, first, the IPCC\u2019s conclusion that the climate crisis is rapidly becoming more severe and, second, that their call for undertaking fundamental action has become increasingly urgent, even relative to their own 2018 report, \u201cGlobal Warming of 1.50C.\u201d It is important to note that this hasn\u2019t always been the pattern with the IPCC. Thus, in its 2014 Fifth Assessment Report, the IPCC was significantly more sanguine about the state of play relative to its 2007 Fourth Assessment Report. In 2014, they were focused on a goal of stabilizing the global average temperature at 2.0 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, rather than the 1.5 degrees figure. As of 2014, the IPCC had not been convinced that the 1.5 degrees target was imperative for having any reasonable chance of limiting the most severe impacts of climate change in terms of heat extremes, floods, droughts, sea level rises and biodiversity losses. The 2014 report concluded that reducing global CO2 emissions by only 36 percent as of 2050 could possibly be sufficient to move onto a viable stabilization path. In this most recent report, there is no equivocation that hitting the 1.5 degrees target is imperative, and that to have any chance of achieving this goal, global CO2 emissions must be at zero by 2050. This new report does also make clear just how difficult it will be to hit the zero emissions target, and thus to remain within the 1.5 degrees of warming threshold. But it also recognizes that a viable stabilization path is still possible, if just barely. There is no question as to what the first and most important single action has to be, which is to stop burning oil, coal and natural gas to produce energy. Carbon-removal technologies will likely be needed as part of the overall stabilization program. But we should note here that there are already two carbon-removal technologies that operate quite effectively. These are: 1) to stop destroying forests, since trees absorb CO2; and 2) to supplant corporate industrial practices with organic and regenerative agriculture. Corporate agricultural practices emit CO2 and other greenhouses gases, especially through the heavy use of nitrogen fertilizer, while, through organic and regenerative agriculture, the soil absorbs CO2. That said, if we don\u2019t stop burning fossil fuels to produce energy, then there is simply no chance of moving onto a stabilization path, no matter what else is accomplished in the area of carbon-removal technologies. I would add here that the main technologies for building a zero-emissions economy \u2014 in the areas of energy efficiency and clean renewable energy sources \u2014 are already fully available to us. Investing in energy efficiency \u2014 through, for example, expanding the supply of electric cars and public transportation systems, and replacing old heating and cooling systems with electric heat pumps \u2014 will save money, by definition, for all energy consumers. Moreover, on average, the cost of producing electricity through both solar and wind energy is already, at present, about half that of burning coal combined with carbon capture technology. At this point, it is a matter of undertaking the investments at scale to build the clean energy infrastructure along with providing for a fair transition for the workers and communities who will be negatively impacted by the phase-out of fossil fuels."

    "input": "The evidence is clear that human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide are behind global warming, and that warming, according to the IPCC report, is taking place faster than predicted. Most likely because of the latter, the Sixth Assessment report provides a detailed regional assessment of climate change, and (for the first time, I believe) includes a chapter on innovation and technology, with emphasis on carbon-removal technologies, which Noam, coincidentally, found \u201cdeeply disturbing.\u201d As one of the leading advocates of a Global Green New Deal, do you see a problem if regional climate and energy plans became the main frameworks, at least in the immediate future, for dealing with the climate emergency?",
    "output": "Pollin: In principle, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with regional climate and energy plans, as long as they are all seriously focused on achieving the zero emissions goal and are advanced in coordination with other regions. The big question, therefore, is whether any given regional program is adequate to the requirements for climate stabilization. The answer, thus far, is \u201cno.\u201d We can see this in terms of the climate programs in place for the U.S., the European Union and China. These are the three most important regions in addressing climate change for the simple reason that these three areas are responsible for generating 54 percent of all global CO2 emissions \u2014 with China at 30 percent, the U.S. at 15 percent and the EU at 9 percent. In the U.S., the Biden administration is, of course, a vast improvement relative to the four disastrous years under Trump. Soon after taking office, Biden set out emissions reduction targets in line with the IPCC, i.e., a 50 percent reduction by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. Moreover, the American Jobs Plan that Biden introduced in March would have allocated about $130 billion per year in investments that would advance a clean energy infrastructure that would supplant our current fossil fuel-dominant system. This level of federal funding for climate stabilization would be unprecedented for the U.S. At the same time, it would provide maybe 25 percent of the total funding necessary for achieving the administration\u2019s own emission reduction targets. Most of the other 75 percent would therefore have to come from private investors. Yet it is not realistic that private businesses will mount this level of investment in a clean energy economy \u2014 at about $400 billion per year \u2014 unless they are forced to by stringent government regulations. One such regulation could be a mandate for electric utilities to reduce CO2 emissions by, say, 5 percent per year, or face criminal liability. The Biden administration has not proposed any such regulations to date. Moreover, with the debates in Congress over the Biden bill ongoing, the odds are long that the amount of federal government funding provided for climate stabilization will even come close to the $130 billion per year that Biden had initially proposed in March. The story is similar in the EU. In terms of its stated commitments, the European Union is advancing the world\u2019s most ambitious climate stabilization program, what it has termed the European Green Deal. Under the European Green Deal, the region has pledged to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent as of 2030 relative to 1990 levels, a more ambitious target than the 45 percent reduction set by the IPCC. The European Green Deal then aligns with the IPCC\u2019s longer-term target of achieving a net zero economy as of 2050. Beginning in December 2019, the European Commission has been enacting measures and introducing further proposals to achieve the region\u2019s emission reduction targets. The most recent measure to have been adopted, this past June, is the NextGenerationEU Recovery Plan, through which \u20ac600 billion will be allocated toward financing the European Green Deal. In July, the European Commission followed up on this spending commitment by outlining 13 tax and regulatory measures to complement the spending program. But here\u2019s the simple budgetary math: The \u20ac600 billion allocated over seven years through the NextGenerationEU Recovery Plan would amount to an average of about \u20ac85 billion per year. This is equal to less than 0.6 percent of EU GDP over this period, when a spending level in the range of 2 to 3 percent of GDP will be needed. As with the U.S., the EU cannot count on mobilizing the remaining 75 percent of funding necessary unless it also enacts stringent regulations on burning fossil fuels. If such regulations are to have teeth, they will mean a sharp increase in what consumers will pay for fossil fuel energy. To prevent all but the wealthy from then experiencing a significant increase in their cost of living, the fossil fuel price increases will have to be matched by rebates. The 2018 Yellow Vest Movement in France emerged precisely in opposition to President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s proposal to enact a carbon tax without including substantial rebates for nonaffluent people. The Chinese situation is distinct from those in the U.S. and EU. In particular, China has not committed to achieving the IPCC\u2019s emission reduction targets for 2030 or 2050. Rather, as of a September 2020 United Nations General Assembly address by President Xi Jinping, China committed to a less ambitious set of targets: emissions will continue to rise until they peak in 2030 and then begin declining. Xi also committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2060, a decade later than the IPCC\u2019s 2050 target. We do need to recognize that China has made major advances in support of climate stabilization. As one critical case in point, China\u2019s ambitious industrial policies are primarily responsible for driving down the costs of solar energy worldwide by 80 percent over the past decade. China has also been the leading supplier of credit to support clean energy investments in developing economies. Nevertheless, there is no getting around the fact that if China sticks to its stated emission reduction plans, there is no chance whatsoever of achieving the IPCC\u2019s targets. In short, for different reasons, China, the U.S. and the EU all need to mount significantly more ambitious regional climate stabilization programs. In particular, these economies need to commit higher levels of public investment to the global clean energy investment project. The basic constraint with increasing public investment is that people don\u2019t want to pay higher taxes. Rich people can, of course, easily afford to pay higher taxes, after enjoying massive increases in their wealth and income under neoliberalism. That said, it is still also true that most of the funds needed to bring global clean energy investments to scale can be made available without raising taxes, by channeling resources from three sources: 1) transferring funds out of military budgets; 2) converting all fossil fuel subsidies into clean energy subsidies; and 3) mounting large-scale green bond purchasing programs by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the People\u2019s Bank of China. Such measures can be the foundation for tying together the U.S., EU and Chinese regional programs that could, in combination, have a chance of meeting the urgent requirements for a viable global climate stabilization project."

They couldn\u2019t refrain from administering a last blow just before being driven from office (barely, and perhaps not for long). The final act in August 2020 was to roll back the last of the far-too-limited Obama-era regulations to have escaped the wrecking ball, \u201ceffectively freeing oil and gas companies from the need to detect and repair methane leaks \u2014 even as new research shows that far more of the potent greenhouse gas is seeping into the atmosphere than previously known ... a gift to many beleaguered oil and gas companies.\u201d It is imperative to serve the prime constituency, great wealth and corporate power, damn the consequences. Indications are that with the rise of oil prices, fracking is reviving, adhering to Trump\u2019s deregulation so as to improve profit margins, while again placing a foot on the accelerator to drive humanity over the cliff. An instructive contribution to impending crisis, minor in context. Even though we know what must and can be done, the gap between willingness to undertake the task and severity of the crisis ahead is large, and there is not much time to remedy this deep malady of contemporary intellectual and moral culture. Like the other urgent problems we face today, heating the planet knows no boundaries. The phrase \u201cinternationalism or extinction\u201d is not hyperbole. There have been international initiatives, notably the 2015 Paris agreement and its successors. The announced goals have not been met. They are also insufficient and toothless. The goal in Paris was to reach a treaty. That was impossible for the usual reason: the Republican Party. It would never agree to a treaty, even if it had not become a party of rigid deniers. Accordingly, there was only a voluntary agreement. So it has remained. Worse still, in pursuit of his goal of wrecking everything in reach, the hallmark of his administration, Trump withdrew from the agreement. Without U.S. participation, in fact leadership, nothing is going to happen. President Joe Biden has rejoined. What that means will depend on popular efforts. I said \u201chad not become\u201d for a reason. The Republican Party was not always dedicated rigidly to destruction of organized human life on Earth; apologies for telling the truth, and not mincing words. In 2008, John McCain ran for president on a ticket that included some concern for destruction of the environment, and congressional Republicans were considering similar ideas. The huge Koch brothers energy consortium had been laboring for years to prevent any such heresy, and moved quickly to cut it off at the past. Under the leadership of the late David Koch, they launched a juggernaut to keep the party on course. It quickly succumbed, and since then has tolerated only rare deviation. The capitulation, of course, has a major effect on legislative options, but also on the voting base, amplified by the media echo-chamber to which most limit themselves. \u201cClimate change\u201d \u2014 the euphemism for destruction of organized human life on Earth \u2014 ranks low in concern among Republicans, frighteningly low in fact. In the most recent Pew poll, just days ago, respondents were asked to rank 15 major problems. Among Republicans, climate change was ranked last, alongside of sexism, far below the front-runners, the federal deficit and illegal immigration. Fourteen percent of Republicans think that the most severe threat in human history is a major problem (though concerns seem to be somewhat higher among younger ones, an encouraging sign). This must change. Turning elsewhere, the picture varies but is not very bright anywhere. China is a mixed story. Though far below the U.S., Australia and Canada in per capita emissions \u2014 the relevant figure \u2014 it nevertheless is poisoning the planet at much too high a level and is still building coal plants. China is far ahead of the rest of the world in renewable energy, both in scale and quality, and has pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2060 \u2014 difficult to imagine at the present pace, but China has had a good record in reaching announced goals. In Canada, the parties have just released their current plans: some commitment but nowhere near enough. That\u2019s aside from the terrible record of Canadian mining companies throughout the world. Europe is a mixed story. The Global South cannot deal with the crisis on its own. To provide substantial assistance is an obligation for the rich, not simply out of concern for their own survival but also a moral obligation, considering an ugly history that we need not review. Can the wealthy and privileged rise to that moral level? Can they even rise to the level of concern for self-preservation if it means some minor sacrifice now? The fate of human society \u2014 and much of the rest of life on Earth \u2014 depends on the answer to that question. An answer that will come soon, or not at all."

    "input": "Bob, in hosting the Earth Day 2021 summit, Biden hopes to persuade the largest emitters to step up their pledges to combat the climate crisis. However, the truth of the matter is that most countries are not hitting the Paris climate targets and the decline in emissions in 2020 was mostly driven by the COVID-19 lockdowns and the ensuing economic recession. So, how do we move from rhetoric to accelerated action, and, in your own view, what are the priority actions that the Biden administration should focus on in order to initiate a clean energy revolution?",
    "output": "Robert Pollin:In terms of moving from rhetoric to accelerated action, it will be useful to be clear about what was accomplished with the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Noam described the Paris agreement and its successors as \u201cinsufficient and toothless.\u201d Just how insufficient and toothless becomes evident in considering the energy consumption and CO2 emissions projections generated by the International Energy Agency (IEA), whose global energy and emissions model is the most detailed and widely cited work of its kind. In the most recent 2020 edition of itsWorld Energy Outlook, the IEA estimates that, if all signatory countries to the Paris agreement fulfilled all of their \u201cNationally Determined Contributions\u201d set out at Paris, global CO2 emissions will not fallat allas of 2040. It\u2019s true that, according to the IEA\u2019s model, emissions level will not increase any further from now until 2040. But this should be cold comfort, given that, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), CO2 emissions need to fall by 45 percent as of 2030 and hit net-zero emissions by 2050 in order for there to be at least a decent chance of stabilizing the global average temperature at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In other words, soaring rhetoric and photo opportunities aside, the Paris agreement accomplishes next to nothing if we are serious about hitting the IPCC emissions reduction targets. The \u201cAmerican Jobs Plan\u201d that the Biden administration introduced at the end of March does give serious attention to many of the main areas in which immediate dramatic action needs to occur. It sets out a range of measures to move the U.S. economy onto a climate stabilization path, including large-scale investments in energy efficiency measures, such as retrofitting buildings and expanding public transportation, along with investments to dramatically expand the supply of clean energy sources to supplant our current fossil fuel-dominant energy system. Burning oil, coal and natural gas to produce energy is now responsible for about 70 percent of all CO2 emissions globally. The Biden proposal also emphasizes the opportunity to create good job opportunities and expand union organizing through these investments in energy efficiency and clean energy. It also recognizes the need for just transition for workers and communities that are now dependent on the fossil fuel industry. These are important positive steps. They resulted because of years of dedicated and effective organizing by many labor and environmental groups, such as the Green New Deal Network and the Labor Network for Sustainability. I also have serious concerns about the Biden proposal. The first is that the scale of spending is too small. This is despite the constant barrage of press stories claiming that the spending levels are astronomical. During the presidential campaign, Biden\u2019s \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d proposal was budgeted at $2 trillion over four years, i.e., $500 billion per year. His current proposal is at $2.3 trillion over eight years, i.e., somewhat less than $300 billion per year. So, on a year-by-year basis, Biden\u2019s current proposal is already 40 percent less than what he had proposed as a candidate. This overall program also includes lots of investment areas other than those dealing with the climate crisis, such as traditional infrastructure spending on roads, bridges and water systems; expanding broadband access; and supporting the care economy, including child and elder care. Many of these other measures are highly worthy. But we need to recognize that they will not contribute to driving down emissions. I would say a generous assessment of the Biden plan is that 30 percent of the spending will contribute to driving down emissions. We now are at a total annual budget of perhaps $100 billion. That is equal to 0.5 percent of current U.S. GDP. It is conceivable that this level of federal spending could be in the range of barely adequate. But that would be only if state and local governments, and even more so, private investors \u2014 including small-scale cooperatives and community-owned enterprises \u2014 commit major resources to clean energy investments. By my own estimates, the U.S. will need to spend in the range of $600 billion per year in total through 2050 to create a zero-emissions economy. That will be equal to nearly 3 percent of U.S. GDP per year. But the private sector will not come up with the additional $400-$500 billion per year unless they are forced to do so. That will entail, for example, stringent regulations requiring the phase out of fossil fuels as energy sources. As one case in point, utilities could be required to reduce their consumption of coal, natural gas and oil by, say, 5 percent per year. Their CEOs would then be [held responsible] if they fail to meet that requirement. At the same time, the Federal Reserve can easily leverage federal spending programs by establishing Green Bond purchasing programs at scale, such as in the range of $300 billion per year to finance clean energy investments by both state and local governments as well as private investors. Right now, a significant number of Green Bond programs do already exist at state and local government levels, including through Green Banks. These are all worthy, but are operating at too small a scale relative to the need. Beyond all this, those of us living in high-income countries need to commit to paying for most of the clean energy transformations in low-income countries. This needs to be recognized as a minimal ethical requirement, since high-income countries are almost entirely responsible for having created the climate crisis in the first place. In addition, even if we don\u2019t care about such ethical matters, it is simply a fact that, unless the low-income countries also undergo clean energy transformations, there will be no way to achieve a zero-emissions global economy, and therefore no solution to the climate crisis, in the U.S., Europe or anyplace else. The Biden proposal to date includes nothing about supporting climate programs in developing economies. This must change."

    "persona": "Political Activist",
    "instruction": "Respond as a political activist",
    "input": "Noam, when surveying reactions to whatever environmental gains have been made over the past 50 years, one observes a rather unsurprising pattern, which is, namely, that the right assigns virtually all credit to businessmen and to capitalism, while the left to environmental activists, and contends that the only hope for a greener tomorrow mandates the rejection of capitalist logic. Is capitalism saving or killing the planet?",
    "output": "It\u2019s close to a truism that, \u201ccapitalist logic will kill the planet.\u201d That\u2019s one of the many reasons why business has always rejected the suicidal doctrines that are piously preached. Rather, the business world demands that a powerful state, under its control, intervene constantly to protect private power from the ravages of an unconstrained market and to sustain the system of public subsidy, private profit that has been a cornerstone of the economy from the early days of industrial state capitalism.... The only way to answer the question posed is to look at examples. Let\u2019s pick a central one: a Green New Deal. In one or another form, such a program is essential for survival. A few years ago the idea was ignored or ridiculed. Now it is at least on the legislative agenda. How did the transition occur? Overwhelmingly, thanks to wide-ranging activism taking many forms, culminating in the occupation of congressional offices by activists of Sunrise Movement. They received support from representatives swept into office on the Sanders wave of popular activism, notably Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, joined by senior Sen. Ed Markey, who had long been concerned with environmental issues. There\u2019s a long way to go from legislative agenda to implementation, but we can be confident that steady and dedicated activism will be a prime factor in carrying the project forward; to be concrete, in pressing Biden\u2019s program, itself a product of sustained activism, toward the kinds of policies that are necessary to reach such goals as net-zero emissions by mid-century. The example breaks no new ground. It is, in fact, the norm. The protestations of the right are, however, not without merit. Given the right structure of benefits and threats, private capital, driven by profit and market share, can be enlisted in pursuing the goal of species survival. That covers contingencies ranging from incentives to invest in solar power to imposing what the private sector calls \u201creputational risks,\u201d the polite term for the fear that the peasants are coming with the pitchforks. There is an impact. We see it in the current rage for ESG investment (environmental and social factors in corporate government) \u2014 all, of course, in service of the bottom line. We also see it in the solemn pledges of corporate executives and business groups to reverse their self-serving course of recent years and to become responsible citizens dedicated to the common good \u2014 to become what used to be called \u201csoulful corporations\u201d in an earlier phase of this recurrent performance \u2014 which may, on occasion, have an element of sincerity, though always subject to institutional constraints. Such impacts of popular activism should not be dismissed \u2014 while always regarded with due caution. They may induce the search for private gain to veer in a constructive direction \u2014 though far too slowly, and only in limited ways. Like it or not, there is no alternative now to large-scale governmental projects. The reference to the New Deal is not out of place. Whatever the source, the outcome should be welcomed. It\u2019s of no slight importance when \u201cMore than 300 corporate leaders are asking the Biden administration to nearly double the emission reduction targets set by the Obama administration,\u201d including big boys like Google, McDonalds, Walmart. The choice is not popular activism or managerial decisions, but both. However, a little reflection on time scales, and on the urgency of the crisis, suffices to show that the critical problems must be addressed within the general framework of existing state capitalist institutions. These can and should be radically changed. At the very least, serious moves should be made to escape the grip of predatory financial capital and the rentier economy that impedes the right mixture of growth/de-growth: growth in what is needed, like renewable energy, efficient mass transportation, education, health, research and development, and much more; de-growth where imperative, as in fossil fuel production. But overall, substantial social change, however important for decent survival, is a long-term project."

    "output": "Pollin:I am not a climate scientist, so I am not qualified to answer the question at the first, most critical level of climate science itself. But I can at least comment on some related points. First, we do know what the IPCC has said about what is needed to have a reasonable chance at climate stabilization \u2014 that is, first of all, to cut global CO2 emissions by 45 percent as of 2030 and to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 in order to stabilize the global average temperature at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. How are we doing in terms of meeting those goals? The only fair assessment is that, to date, the record is dismal. I would add here one additional set of observations beyond what we have already described. That is, climate scientists have known about the phenomenon of global warming since the late 19th century. But, as a steady pattern, the average global temperature only began rising above the pre-industrial level in the late 1970s. By the mid-1990s, the average temperature was 0.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level. As of 2020, we are nearly at 1 degree above the pre-industrial level. If we follow the pattern of the past 20 years, we will therefore breach the 1.5 degrees threshold by roughly 2040. What happens if we do breach the 1.5 degrees threshold? I claim no expertise on this, and I think it is fair to say that nobody knows for certain. But we do at least know that the patterns we are already seeing at our current level of warming will only intensify. Thus, the World Meteorological Organizations\u2019 provisional 2020 report, \u201cState of the Global Climate\u201d finds that, \u201cHeavy rain and extensive flooding occurred over large parts of Africa and Asia in 2020. Heavy rain and flooding affected much of the Sahel, the Greater Horn of Africa, the India subcontinent and neighboring areas, China, Korea and Japan, and parts of southeast Asia at various times of the year. Severe drought affected many parts of interior South America in 2020, with the worst-affected areas being northern Argentina, Paraguay and western border areas of Brazil.... Climate and weather events have triggered significant population movements and have severely affected vulnerable people on the move, including in the Pacific region and Central America.\u201d We also know that poor people and poor countries have already borne the greatest costs of the climate crisis, and that this pattern will continue as global average temperatures increase. As the economist James Boyce has written, poor people \u201care less able to invest in air conditioners, sea walls and other adaptations. They live closer to the edge ... and the places that climate models show will be hit hardest by global warming \u2014 including drought-prone regions of sub-Saharan Africa and typhoon-vulnerable South and South East Asia \u2014 are home to some of the world\u2019s poorest people.\u201d It therefore seems clear that we are obligated to act now on the premise that the climate crisis is a race that we can still win, even if we don\u2019t know for certain whether that is true. But in addition, it is important to also recognize that advancing a global Green New Deal is fundamentally a no-lose proposition, as long as it includes generous transition support for fossil fuel-dependent workers and communities. This is because, first, the global clean energy transformation will be a major source of job creation in all regions of the world as well as creating a viable path to building a zero-emissions global economy. It will also significantly improve public health by reducing air pollution, lower energy costs across the board, and create opportunities to deliver electricity to rural areas of low-income countries for the first time. All of these impacts will also help break the grip that neoliberalism has maintained over the global economy over the past 40 years. If we do end up building a viable clean energy system through a global Green New Deal, we will therefore also succeed in advancing democracy and egalitarianism. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity."

When I think about this, it is clear to me that political parties place profound emphasis on gaining power. Without necessarily psychologizing this, is it that the Republican Party embodies a death wish or some kind of profound nihilism?",
    "output": "There\u2019s a lot of factors, but some of them are on the surface, before we get into psychology. First of all, Trump had an enormous effect. There were plenty of problems in the party, but he just poisoned it and by now he owns it. He was a genius at tapping into all of the poisonous currents that lie right beneath the surface in America, which includes white supremacy, and \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d conspiracy theories. He knew very well how to bring up such poisons, mobilize them, and turn them into a raging force of terrified people who think the world is coming to an end. That\u2019s the kind of genius that Adolf Hitler had, and others who are not very pretty people. And Trump still has these people; they have taken over the party. David Brooks, who is a longtime dedicated Republican, argues that the GOP is far worse than we think. Let\u2019s take climate change. When you examine the climate policy, there are things that happened that tell us a lot about American politics. If you go back, just before Trump, which is the last time when Republican leaders could actually talk without the Trump shadow, it\u2019s very interesting to look at the Republican primaries. I\u2019m referring to a time when there is the cream of the crop of the Republican leadership. There\u2019s no Trump yet. Every single one either denied that climate change is happening or said if it\u2019s happening then they don\u2019t care. There was one Republican, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who was described as the \u201csane\u201d one, as the adult in the room. He was considered so decent that he was invited to speak at the 2020 Democratic Convention. He was considered a \u201cgood Republican.\u201d I think that he was worst of the lot. If you look back at what he said, he was the one person who said, \u2018Yes, global warming is happening, humans are responsible for it, and the science is right.\u2019 But as governor of Ohio, he said that we in Ohio are going to use coal and not apologize for it. He was aware that they were destroying the world, destroying the prospects for human life, but he said that he would do it and not apologize for it. Now, that\u2019s the \u201csane\u201d person in the room that you invite to Biden\u2019s Democratic National Convention speech. That tells you something about the mentality \u2014 and not just the Republicans. But why did the Republican Party become such dedicated denialists? This wasn\u2019t always true. It wasn\u2019t true in 2008 when John McCain ran for president. He did have a climate plank in his platform, not very much, but something other Republicans in the Senate were beginning to consider. They were considering moderate measures to do something about global warming. Well, the Koch brothers, who own a huge energy conglomerate, heard about this effort. They had been working for years to try to ensure that the Republican Party didn\u2019t make a move toward trying to do anything that would harm their profits. Perhaps some of the Republicans may have been true believers, maybe they really were, but who cares? Maybe Hitler really believed that the Jews were poisoning civilization, and that he and others believed that they had to save themselves, but it doesn\u2019t matter if they believe it or not. So, if David Koch talked himself into it, I don\u2019t care. The Koch brothers were devoting themselves to controlling the party, making sure it didn\u2019t have any hint of concern for climate change. When they heard about this deviation, they went into overtime to try to cut it off at the pass. As a huge juggernaut, they engaged in massive lobbying, threats, buying off senators and astroturfing. Everything you could think of. Then the Republican Party shifted: \u201cThere is no more a serious climate problem.\u201d And since this, they have been a party of denialists. And the leadership is dedicated to this. They have a media echo chamber atFox News. They had Rush Limbaugh, when he was around, and others. When it comes to the voting base, well, that\u2019s their world; they turn toFox Newsfor their source of information. They are being bombarded with this stuff and the results are clear. There was a recent Pew Research Institute poll that had very interesting results. It gave people a choice of 15 options for what they thought was a major problem. And they divided it into Republicans and Democrats. Democrats were not all that great I should say, but among the Republicans, it\u2019s shocking. The least important issue for them was climate change. It\u2019s only the most important question that\u2019s ever arisen in human history. Is our species going to survive in any recognizable form? This question has to be answered right now \u2014 this generation. However, climate change, along with sexism, was ranked the least important issue. What\u2019s at the top of the list? Well, \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants and the budget deficit. And notice the budget deficit became an issue this January. Before that it was not a problem. It was great to have a budget deficit, because the Republicans were creating it to enrich their constituency of great wealth. So, it was fine to have a budget deficit. However, as soon as the Democrats come in, the budget deficit is the most urgent problem we face, along with an assumption that there will be a \u201choard of illegal immigrants\u201d who are going to carry out the \u201cGreat Replacement,\u201d and carry out genocide against the white race. You know the litany. Well, if people are living in that world, you can kind of understand why about 40 percent of Republicans say that it\u2019s right to use political violence to protect the country from what\u2019s \u201chappening.\u201d But you can\u2019t even call it surreal. It\u2019s often from outer space, but it\u2019s working. Take a look at Marjorie Taylor Greene. For her, it\u2019s literally from outer space. After all of the ridiculousness got exposed, her funding shot into the stratosphere. She is now getting more support than anyone else. And you can see it from people who believe this. Incidentally, these are not poor people. The Robert Pape studies and other studies, for example, Anthony DiMaggio\u2019s work, show that the main Republican Trump base is moderately affluent. It\u2019s people who are above the median. Not very rich, but people who own stores, run construction businesses, insurance salesmen. What used to be called the petty bourgeoisie, those above the median but not great. These are people who see their traditional lives being taken away from them. They have been harmed by neoliberal policies where their communities may be collapsing. You go to a rural town in the United States and their businesses are closed down, the bank is shuttered, and young people are leaving their traditional \u201chappy\u201d white Christian, white supremacist environments.... Well, that is all disappearing. You can build this up to the \u201cGreat Replacement,\u201d where the idea is that they\u2019re all trying to take it away from us and kill us all. All of these things feed together, but right on top of it, you have a highly corrupt, cynical leadership which is willing to be bought off to become deniers of what\u2019s happening, which happens to be on the verge of destroying human life on Earth. And incidentally, it\u2019s not the first time that this has happened. Just go back 50 years to Richard Nixon and the Southern strategy. It\u2019s not very different. Nixon recognized that you have to have limited civil rights, very limited, for African Americans. By doing so you\u2019re going to alienate the Southern white population. In this way, he\u2019s going to set up a racist party, which will pick up white Southern votes. It was perfectly open; it wasn\u2019t concealed. A few years later, in the mid-1970s, the Republican strategist Paul Weyrich had a flash of light and realized that if the Republican Party pretended to be opposed to abortion, they could pick up the huge Evangelical vote and make inroads into the Northern Catholic vote, a lot of whom were Democrats. I stresspretendedas the leading figures in the Republican Party were what we now call pro-choice. Ronald Reagan, when he was governor of California, in the 1960s, passed one of the strongest legislations giving women the right to choose. The same with George H.W. Bush, and the same with the rest of them, but they turned on a dime. They all became passionately anti- abortion. The whole anti-abortion policy, within this context, is a fraud.... You can\u2019t even call it cynicism. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the right word. It\u2019s evil incarnate, and it\u2019s running across the board. And you can\u2019t blame just [Republicans]. Take the current situation with vaccines. Unless vaccines go to the Global South, to the poorer countries, to Africa, to Asia, unless they get vaccines quickly, the virus is going to mutate. It\u2019s already happening, you get more lethal strains. You may get something like Ebola, which is so lethal you can\u2019t do anything about it. Pretty soon it\u2019s going to spread back to Europe. You guys are all going to die. What are they doing? Holding on to the vaccines, refusing to give them to Africa and Asia. It\u2019s not just beyond immoral, especially considering what Europe did to these areas over the centuries, it\u2019s suicidal. It is the importance of greed and ensuring that I have what I need which overwhelms everything. A large part of it is protecting the so-called intellectual property rights of the big pharmaceutical corporations. We\u2019ve got to make sure that they make exorbitant profits, even if we kill ourselves.... This is a malady that is deep-seated. An important step was taken by President Joe Biden when he announced that the U.S. would support a temporary waiver of patent rights at the World Health Organization. That will initiate a long negotiating process with many pitfalls, and will not relieve the horrendous crisis in India or the immediate problems of lack of vaccines for the poorer areas. Much more must be done, without delay. I think that this raises the issue of the crucial importance of education. You\u2019ve argued that education is often a site of indoctrination, which you link with the essential point that critical questions are not being asked, where there are not enough people who are being disobedient. Do you still hold this position? I suspect that you still hold this to be true because I don\u2019t think that many of us are asking those necessary questions. And we don\u2019t seem to be disobedient, especially in ways that challenge how we are not being good stewards of the Earth, not only in terms of climate change, the use of fossil fuels, but in terms of how we are finding ourselves on the precipice of a nuclear war. Along with global warming, another enormous threat to survival, which is not even discussed is the threat of nuclear war. Anyone who\u2019s looked at the record will know that it is virtually a miracle that we\u2019ve escaped total destruction over the last 75 years. There\u2019s case after case, sometimes often just by accident, where we came perilously close to the missiles going off, which means basically the end for us all. Human intervention, at the last minute, blocked such a devastation. There are cases of very reckless actions by leaders, including those who many people \u2014 not me \u2014 respect. Think here of John F. Kennedy. His very reckless actions brought us very close to the brink of terminal war. You look over the record, and it\u2019s just shocking, but it\u2019s getting worse.... Trump\u2019s worst crimes are his environmental policies and his nuclear policies. There was an arms control regime which had laboriously been put together since Dwight Eisenhower, bits and pieces, but it was something at least. When in office, the main thing that Trump understood was, \u201cLet\u2019s wreck things! I want to be on the front page, and I have no clue what to do so I\u2019ll wreck things.\u201d That was basically the policy. And one of the things that he wrecked was the arms control regime, step by step, every piece he could destroy. He didn\u2019t just wreck it, but wrecked it with a declaration: \u201cI want you to come in and join me.\u201d Immediately after dismantling the [Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty] in August 2019, which was the Reagan-Gorbachev treaty, which had been very valuable in reducing the threat of war in Europe, Trump sent off missiles, which had obviously been prepared, which violated the treaty. He\u2019s telling the Russians, \u201cHey, boys. Join us in this fun game of destroying everything.\u201d Trump destroyed the Open Skies Treaty, which goes back to Eisenhower. Trump was within hours of destroying the last of the treaties. In fact, it was Biden who came in literally hours before the New START Treaty \u2014 which Trump had been avoiding Russian efforts to extend \u2014 was about to expire. And meanwhile [Trump] was building new, more destructive weapons, and moving into weaponizing space, which others will follow. This is asking for suicide. People in the arms control community are well aware of it, and warning about it, but it barely gets mentioned. Biden, unfortunately, is picking up the military program. It\u2019s already well beyond anything that we need. Going back to your question about being disobedient, I would put it a little differently. I would stress just questioning. There is a rule of thumb that everyone should have in mind. It should be built-in from childhood. If everybody agrees on something that\u2019s more complicated than two plus two equals four, a light should go off in your head. Nobody can agree totally on anything moderately complicated. So, if everyone agrees, then it\u2019s probably deep indoctrination, and there\u2019s some scam going on behind it. You should believe that in the sciences, in ordinary life and certainly in political life. So, what are the things that every right-thinking person believes? We\u2019ve got to face the threat of China and the threat of Iran. Everyone believes it, and so it\u2019s obviously a question of some complexity. So, ask yourself: What\u2019s the threat of China and what\u2019s the threat of Iran? Well, you start asking that question, then the whole ideological system collapses. You start pushing it, and you know a lot of things are wrong, but they are not threats. So, Iran has a rotten government, not as bad as the ones we support like Saudi Arabia but pretty rotten. But is that a threat to us? Suppose Iran was developing nuclear weapons, which we have no reason to believe. Would that be a threat to us? If Iran had a nuclear weapon, could they use it, could they arm a missile with it? If they did, the country would be vaporized. The ruling clerics, which are not my favorite people, or yours, have no particular instinct for immediate suicide and losing everything that they have. American intelligence says the same thing. In the past they said if [Iran had] a nuclear program, then it would be part of their deterrence strategy. Why does a country have a deterrence strategy? Well, because somebody is ready to attack them. Who\u2019s ready to attack them? The countries that are at war with them already, which is the United States and Israel. When the United States boasts of carrying out cyber war that destroys Iranian facilities, that\u2019s an act of war. When Israel assassinates nuclear scientists and blows up facilities, that\u2019s an act of war. We are openly and proudly at war with Iran. So, should they develop a deterrent capacity? Is that a threat to us if they do? In a way, yes. If a country wants to rampage freely in the region, and they don\u2019t want to have deterrence around, yes, that\u2019s kind of a threat. Pursue this further, you see more. There are a lot of things China shouldn\u2019t be doing. The internal repression in China is serious. Not as bad as a lot of things we do but serious. Yes, they should not be doing that, though it isn\u2019t a threat to us. And, unfortunately, we can\u2019t do much about it. We can do a lot about the repression we\u2019re carrying out, but we don\u2019t want to talk about that. And in the South China Sea, which has enormous commercial and security significance to China, they are violating international law and carrying out acts that they shouldn\u2019t be carrying out. The answer to that is not to send a Naval armada into the South China Sea, which could lead to possible provocations, which could explode. And if anything does explode, we\u2019re all finished. There can\u2019t be a nuclear war with China or with Russia. We\u2019re all dead if that happens. That\u2019s not the way to do it. The way to do it is with diplomacy and negotiations. There are opportunities, which may not come out perfectly, but to take one of Trump\u2019s rare true statements: \u201cYou think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d The one true statement that he was able to make in a flood of lies. You know, the same is true with provocations on the Russian border. Notice, the Russian border, not the Mexican border. That\u2019s not the place to have provocative military exercises, it\u2019s not the place to put up anti-ballistic missile installations which is what Barack Obama did, which have dual use and can be used not only for surveillance but even guidance. You just don\u2019t do that if you want to live in a world that survives. The basic and significant point, going back to dissent, and it should be repeated, is that if there\u2019s too much agreement on some complicated question, you should be suspicious. Complicated questions should be debated."

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: Noam, the U.S. assassination of Iran\u2019s Quds Force commander Qassim Suleimani has reaffirmed Washington\u2019s long-held obsession with Tehran and its clerical regime, which goes all the way back to the late 1970s. What is the conflict between U.S. and Iran all about, and does the assassination of Suleimani constitute an act of war?",
    "output": "Act of war? Perhaps we can settle on reckless international terrorism. It seems that Trump\u2019s decision, on a whim, appalled high Pentagon officials who briefed him on options, on pragmatic grounds. If we wish to look beyond, we might ask how we would react in comparable circumstances. Suppose that Iran were to murder the second-highest U.S. official, its top general, in the Mexico City international airport, along with the commander of a large part of the U.S.-supported army of an allied nation. Would that be an act of war? Others can decide. It is enough for us to recognize that the analogy is fair enough, and that the pretexts put forth by Washington collapse so quickly on examination that it would be embarrassing to run through them. Suleimani was greatly respected \u2014 not only in Iran, where he was a kind of cult figure. This is recognized by U.S. experts on Iran. One of the most prominent experts, Vali Nasr (no dove, and who detests Suleimani), says that Iraqis, including Iraqi Kurds, \u201cdon\u2019t see him as the nefarious figure that the West does, but they see him through the prism of defeating ISIS.\u201d They have not forgotten that when the huge, heavily armed U.S.-trained Iraqi army quickly collapsed, and the Kurdish capital of Erbil, then Baghdad and all of Iraq were about to fall in the hands of ISIS [also known as Daesh], it was Suleimani and the Iraqi Shia militias he organized that saved the country. Not a small matter. As for what the conflict is all about, the background reasons are not obscure. It has long been a primary principle of U.S. foreign policy to control the vast energy resources of the Middle East: tocontrol, not necessarily to use. Iran has been central to this objective during the post-World War II period, and its escape from the U.S. orbit in 1979 has accordingly been intolerable. The \u201cobsession\u201d can be traced to 1953, when Britain \u2014 the overlord of Iran since oil was discovered there \u2014 was unable to prevent the government from taking over its own resources and called on the global superpower to manage the operation. There is no space to review the course of the obsession since in detail, but some highlights are instructive. Britain called on Washington with some reluctance. To do so meant surrendering more of its former empire to the U.S. and declining even more to the role of \u201cjunior partner\u201d in global management, as the foreign office recognized with dismay. The Eisenhower administration took over. It organized a military coup that overthrew the parliamentary regime and re-installed the Shah, restoring the oil concession to its rightful hands, with the U.S. taking over 40 percent of the former British concession. Interestingly, Washington had to force U.S. majors to accept this gift; they preferred to keep to cheaper Saudi oil (which the U.S. had taken over from Britain in a mini war during World War II). But under government coercion, they were forced to comply: one of those unusual but instructive incidents revealing how the government sometimes pursues long-term imperial interests over the objections of the powerful corporate sector that largely controls and even staffs it \u2014 with considerable resonance in U.S.-Iran relations in recent years. The Shah proceeded to institute a harsh tyranny. He was regularly cited by Amnesty International as a leading practitioner of torture, always with strong U.S. support as Iran became one of the pillars of U.S. power in the region, along with the Saudi family dictatorship and Israel. Technically, Iran and Israel were at war. In reality, they had extremely close relations, which surfaced publicly after the overthrow of the Shah in 1979. The tacit relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia are surfacing much more clearly now within the framework of the reactionary alliance that the Trump administration is forging as a base for U.S. power in the region: the Gulf dictatorships, the Egyptian military dictatorship and Israel, linked to Modi\u2019s India, Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil and other similar elements. A rare semblance of a coherent strategy in this chaotic administration. The Carter administration strongly supported the Shah until the last moment. High U.S. officials \u2014 [Henry] Kissinger, [Dick] Cheney, [Donald] Rumsfeld \u2014 called on U.S. universities (mainly my own, MIT, over strong student protest but faculty acquiescence) to aid the Shah\u2019s nuclear programs, even after he made clear that he was seeking nuclear weapons. When the popular uprising overthrew the Shah, the Carter administration was apparently split on whether to endorse the advice of de facto Israeli Ambassador Uri Lubrani, who counselled that \u201cTehran can be taken over by a very relatively small force, determined, ruthless, cruel. I mean the men who would lead that force will have to be emotionally geared to the possibility that they\u2019d have to kill ten thousand people.\u201d It didn\u2019t work, and soon Ayatollah Khomeini took over on an enormous wave of popular enthusiasm, establishing the brutal clerical autocracy that still reigns, crushing popular protests. Shortly after, Saddam Hussein invaded Iran with strong U.S. backing, unaffected by his resort to chemical weapons that caused huge Iranian casualties; his monstrous chemical warfare attacks against Iraqi Kurds were denied by Reagan, who sought to blame Iran and blocked congressional condemnation. Finally, the U.S. pretty much took over, sending naval forces to ensure Saddam\u2019s control of the Gulf. After the U.S. guided missile cruiser Vincennes shot down an Iranian civilian airliner in a clearly marked commercial corridor, killing 290 passengers and returning to port to great acclaim and awards for exceptional service, Khomeini capitulated, recognizing that Iran cannot fight the U.S. President Bush then invited Iraqi nuclear scientists to Washington for advanced training in nuclear weapons production, a very serious threat against Iran. Conflicts continued without a break, in more recent years focusing on Iran\u2019s nuclear programs. These conflicts ended (in theory) with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015, an agreement between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN, plus Germany, in which Iran agreed to sharply curtail its nuclear programs \u2014 none of them weapons programs \u2014 in return for Western concessions. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which carries out intensive inspections, reports that Iran fully lived up to the agreement. U.S. intelligence agrees. The topic elicits much debate, unlike another question: Has the U.S. observed the agreement? Apparently not. The JCPOA states that all participants are committed not to impede in any way Iran\u2019s reintegration into the global economy, particularly the global financial system, which the U.S. effectively controls. The U.S. is not permitted to interfere \u201cin areas of trade, technology, finance and energy\u201d and others. While these topics are not investigated, it appears that Washington has been interfering steadily. President Trump claims that his effective demolition of the JCPOA is an effort to negotiate an improvement. It\u2019s a worthy objective, easily realized. Any concerns about Iranian nuclear threats can be overcome by establishing a nuclear weapons-free zone (NWFZ) in the Middle East, with intensive inspections like those successfully implemented under the JCPOA. As we have discussed before, this is quite straightforward. Regional support is overwhelming. The Arab states initiated the proposal long ago, and continue to agitate for it, with the strong support of Iran and the former nonaligned countries (G-77, now 132 countries). Europe agrees. In fact, there is only one barrier: the U.S., which regularly vetoes the proposal when it comes up at the review meetings of the Non-Proliferation Treaty countries, most recently by Obama in 2015. The U.S. will not permit inspection of Israel\u2019s enormous nuclear arsenal, or even concede its existence, though it is not in doubt. The reason is simple: under U.S. law (the Symington Amendment), conceding its existence would require terminating all aid to Israel. So the simple method of ending the alleged concern about an Iranian threat is ruled out and the world must face grim prospects. Since these topics are scarcely mentionable in the U.S., it is perhaps worthwhile to reiterate another forbidden matter: The U.S. and U.K. have a special responsibility to work to establish a NWFZ in the Middle East. They are formally committed to do so under Article 14 of UN Security Council Resolution 687, which they invoked in their effort to concoct some thin legal basis for their invasion of Iraq, claiming that Iraq had violated the Resolution with nuclear weapons programs. Iraq hadn\u2019t, as they were soon forced to concede. But the U.S. continues to violate the Resolution to the present in order to protect its Israeli client and to allow Washington to violate U.S. law. Interesting facts, which, unfortunately, are apparently too incendiary to see the light of day. There\u2019s no point reviewing the years that followed in the hands of the man \u201csent by God to save Israel from Iran,\u201d in the words of the serious figure of the administration, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Returning to the original question, there\u2019s quite a lot to contemplate about what the conflict is about. In a phrase, primarily imperial power, damn the consequences."

Given that definition, isn\u2019t the U.S. a star example of a rogue state?",
    "output": "State Department officials are not the only ones to use the term \u201crogue state.\u201d It has also been used by prominent American political scientists \u2014 referring to the State Department. Not Trump\u2019s, Clinton\u2019s. During the era between Reagan\u2019s murderous terrorist atrocities in Central America and Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq, they recognized that for much of the world, the U.S. was \u201cbecoming the rogue superpower,\u201d considered \u201cthe single greatest external threat to their societies,\u201d and that, \u201cIn the eyes of much of the world, in fact, the prime rogue state today is the United States\u201d (Harvard professor of the science of government and government adviser Samuel Huntington; President of the American Political Science Association Robert Jervis. Both in the main establishment journal,Foreign Affairs, 1999, 2001). After Bush took over, qualifications were dropped. It was asserted as fact that the U.S. \u201chas assumed many of the very features of the \u2018rogue nations\u2019 against which it has ... done battle.\u201d Others outside the U.S. mainstream might think of different words for the worst crime of the millennium, a textbook example of aggression without credible pretext, the \u201csupreme international crime\u201d of Nuremberg. And others sometimes express their opinions. Gallup runs regular polls of international opinion. In 2013 (the Obama years), it asked for the first time, which country is the greatest threat to world peace. The U.S. won; no one else even came close. Far behind in second place was Pakistan, presumably inflated by the Indian vote. Iran \u2014 the greatest threat to world peace in U.S. discourse \u2014 was scarcely mentioned. That was also the last time the question was asked, though there needn\u2019t have been much concern. It does not seem to have been reported in the U.S. We might ponder these questions a little further. We are supposed to revere the U.S. Constitution, especially conservatives. We must therefore revere Article VI, which declares that valid treaties shall be \u201cthe supreme law of the land\u201d and officials must be bound by them. In the post-war years, by far the most important such treaty is the UN Charter, instituted under U.S. initiative. It bans \u201cthe threat or use of force\u201d in international affairs; specifically, the common refrain that \u201call options are open\u201d with regard to Iran. And all cases of resort to force unless explicitly authorized by the Security Council or in defense against armed attack (a narrowly construed notion) until the Security Council, which must be immediately notified, is able to act to terminate the attack. We might consider what the world would look like if the U.S. Constitution were considered applicable to the U.S., but let\u2019s put that interesting question aside \u2014 not, however, without mentioning that there is a respected profession, called \u201cinternational lawyers and law professors,\u201d who can learnedly explain that words don\u2019t mean what they mean."

However, the Iraqi parliament has voted after Suleimani\u2019s assassination to expel all U.S. troops. Is this likely to happen? And, if it does, what impact would it have on future U.S.- Iraq-Iran relations, including the fight against ISIS?",
    "output": "We don\u2019t know whether it will happen. Even if the Iraqi government orders the U.S. to leave, will it do so? It\u2019s not obvious, and as always, public opinion in the U.S., if organized and committed, can help provide an answer. As for ISIS, Trump has just given it another lease on life, just as he gave it a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card when he betrayed Syrian Kurds, leaving them to the mercy of their bitter enemies Turkey and Assad after they had fulfilled their function of fighting the war against ISIS (with 11,000 casualties, as compared with half-dozen Americans). ISIS organized at first with jail breaks and is now free to do so again. ISIS has been given a welcome gift in Iraq as well. The eminent Middle East historian Ervand Abrahamian observes: The killing of Soleimani ... has actually provided a wonderful opportunity for ISIS to recover. There will be a resurgence of ISIS very much in Mosul, northern Iraq. And that, paradoxically, will help Iran, because the Iraqi government will have no choice but to rely more and more on Iran to be able to contain ISIS [which led the defense of Iraq against the ISIS onslaught, under Suleimani\u2019s command] ... Trump has pulled out of north Iraq, of the area where ISIS was, pulled the rug out from the Kurds, and now he\u2019s declared war on the pro-Iranian militias. And the Iraqi Army has not been in the past capable of dealing with ISIS. So, the obvious thing is now, the Iraqi government, how are they going to deal with the revival of ISIS? ... they will have no choice but to actually rely more and more on Iran. So, Trump has actually undermined his own policy, if he wants to eliminate Iran\u2019s influence in Iraq. Much as W. Bush did when he invaded Iraq. We shouldn\u2019t forget, however, that enormous power can recover from muddle-headedness and failure \u2014 if the domestic population permits it to."

What is Moscow after in the Middle East, and what\u2019s your explanation for the often infantile diplomacy displayed by the United States in the region and in fact around the world?",
    "output": "One goal, substantially achieved, was to gain control of Syria. Russia entered the conflict in 2015 after advanced weapons provided by the CIA to the mostly jihadi armies had stopped Assad\u2019s forces. Russian aircraft turned the tide, and without concern for the incredible civilian toll, the Russian-backed coalition has taken control of most of the country. Russia is now the external arbiter. Elsewhere, even among Washington\u2019s Gulf allies, Putin has presented himself, apparently with some success, as the one trustworthy outside actor. Trump\u2019s bull-in-a-China-shop diplomacy (if that is the right word) is winning few friends outside of Israel, on which he is lavishing gifts, and the other members of the reactionary alliance taking shape. Any thought of \u201csoft power\u201d has been pretty much abandoned. But U.S. reserves of hard power are enormous. No other country can impose harsh sanctions at will and compel third parties to honor them, at cost of expulsion from the international financial system. And, of course, no one else has hundreds of military bases around the world or anything like Washington\u2019s advanced military power and ability to resort to force at will and with impunity. The idea of imposing sanctions on the U.S., or anything beyond tepid criticism, borders on ludicrous. And so, it is likely to remain even as \u201cin the eyes of much of the world, in fact, the prime rogue state today is the United States,\u201d considerably more so than 20 years ago when these words were uttered, unless and until the population compels state power to pursue a different course. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length."

Polychroniou: Noam, while a fourth round of negotiations was scheduled to take place today between Russian and Ukrainian representatives, it is now postponed until tomorrow, and it still seems unlikely that peace will be reached in Ukraine any time soon. Ukrainians don\u2019t appear likely to surrender, and Putin seems determined to continue his invasion. In that context, what do you think of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s response to Vladimir Putin\u2019s four core demands, which were (a) cease military action, (b) acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory, (c) amend the Ukrainian constitution to enshrine neutrality, and (d) recognize the separatist republics in eastern Ukraine?",
    "output": "Before responding, I would like to stress the crucial issue that must be in the forefront of all discussions of this terrible tragedy: We must find a way to bring this war to an end before it escalates, possibly to utter devastation of Ukraine and unimaginable catastrophe beyond. The only way is a negotiated settlement. Like it or not, this must provide some kind of escape hatch for Putin, or the worst will happen. Not victory, but an escape hatch. These concerns must be uppermost in our minds. I don\u2019t think that Zelensky should have simply accepted Putin\u2019s demands. I think his public response on March 7 was judicious and appropriate. In these remarks, Zelensky recognized that joining NATO is not an option for Ukraine. He also insisted, rightly, that the opinions of people in the Donbas region, now occupied by Russia, should be a critical factor in determining some form of settlement. He is, in short, reiterating what would very likely have been a path for preventing this tragedy \u2014 though we cannot know, because the U.S. refused to try. As has been understood for a long time, decades in fact, for Ukraine to join NATO would be rather like Mexico joining a China-run military alliance, hosting joint maneuvers with the Chinese army and maintaining weapons aimed at Washington. To insist on Mexico\u2019s sovereign right to do so would surpass idiocy (and, fortunately, no one brings this up). Washington\u2019s insistence on Ukraine\u2019s sovereign right to join NATO is even worse, since it sets up an insurmountable barrier to a peaceful resolution of a crisis that is already a shocking crime and will soon become much worse unless resolved \u2014 by the negotiations that Washington refuses to join. That\u2019s quite apart from the comical spectacle of the posturing about sovereignty by the world\u2019s leader in brazen contempt for the doctrine, ridiculed all over the Global South though the U.S. and the West in general maintain their impressive discipline and take the posturing seriously, or at least pretend to do so. Zelensky\u2019s proposals considerably narrow the gap with Putin\u2019s demands and provide an opportunity to carry forward the diplomatic initiatives that have been undertaken by France and Germany, with limited Chinese support. Negotiations might succeed or might fail. The only way to find out is to try. Of course, negotiations will get nowhere if the U.S. persists in its adamant refusal to join, backed by the virtually united commissariat, and if the press continues to insist that the public remain in the dark by refusing even to report Zelensky\u2019s proposals. In fairness, I should add that on March 13, theNew York Timesdid publish a call for diplomacy that would carry forward the \u201cvirtual summit\u201d of France-Germany-China, while offering Putin an \u201cofframp,\u201d distasteful as that is. The article was written by Wang Huiyao, president of a Beijing nongovernmental think tank."

    "input": "It also seems to me that, in some quarters, peace in Ukraine is hardly on top of the agenda. For example, there are plenty of voices both in the U.S. and in U.K. urging Ukraine to keep on fighting (although western governments have ruled out sending troops to defend Ukraine), probably in the hopes that the continuation of the war, in conjunction with the economic sanctions, may lead to regime change in Moscow. Yet, isn\u2019t it the case that even if Putin actually falls from power, it would still be necessary to negotiate a peace treaty with whatever Russia government comes next, and that compromises would have to be made for the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine?",
    "output": "We can only speculate about the reasons for U.S.-U.K. total concentration on warlike and punitive measures, and refusal to join in the one sensible approach to ending the tragedy. Perhaps it is based on hope for regime change. If so, it is both criminal and foolish. Criminal because it perpetuates the vicious war and cuts off hope for ending the horrors, foolish because it is quite likely that if Putin is overthrown someone even worse will take over. That has been a consistent pattern in elimination of leadership in criminal organizations for many years, matters discussed very convincingly by Andrew Cockburn. And at best, as you say, it would leave the problem of settlement where it stands. Another possibility is that Washington is satisfied with how the conflict is proceeding. As we have discussed, in his criminal foolishness, Putin provided Washington with an enormous gift: firmly establishing the U.S.-run Atlanticist framework for Europe and cutting off the option of an independent \u201cEuropean common home,\u201d a long-standing issue in world affairs as far back as the origin of the Cold War. I personally am reluctant to go as far as the highly knowledgeable sources we discussed earlier who conclude that Washington planned this outcome, but it\u2019s clear enough that it has eventuated. And, possibly, Washington planners see no reason to act to change what is underway. It is worth noticing that most of the world is keeping apart from the awful spectacle underway in Europe. One telling illustration is sanctions. Political analyst John Whitbeck has produced a map of sanctions against Russia: the U.S. and the rest of the Anglosphere, Europe and some of East Asia. None in the Global South, which is watching, bemused, as Europe reverts to its traditional pastime of mutual slaughter while relentlessly pursuing its vocation of destroying whatever else it chooses to within its reach: Yemen, Palestine, and far more. Voices in the Global South condemn Putin\u2019s brutal crime, but do not conceal the supreme hypocrisy of western posturing about crimes that are a bare fraction of their own regular practices, right to the present."

What does the change in Germany\u2019s Russia strategy \u2014 i.e., its rearmament and the apparent end ofOstpolitik\u2014 mean for Europe and global diplomacy?",
    "output": "The major effect, I suspect, will be what I mentioned: more firm imposition of the U.S.-run, NATO-based Atlanticist model and curtailing once again the repeated efforts to create a European system independent of the U.S., a \u201cthird force\u201d in world affairs, as it was sometimes called. That has been a fundamental issue since the end of World War II. Putin has settled it for the time being by providing Washington with its fondest wish: a Europe so subservient that an Italian university tried to ban a series of lectures on Dostoyevsky, to take just one of many egregious examples of how Europeans are making fools of themselves. Meanwhile, it seems likely that Russia will drift further into China\u2019s orbit, becoming even more of a declining kleptocratic raw materials producer than it is now. China is likely to persist in its programs of incorporating more and more of the world into the development-and-investment system based on the Belt-and-Road initiative, the \u201cmaritime silk road\u201d that passes through the UAE into the Middle East, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The U.S. seems intent on responding with its comparative advantage: force. Right now, that includes Biden\u2019s programs of \u201cencirclement\u201d of China by military bases and alliances, while perhaps even seeking to improve the U.S. economy as long as it is framed as competing with China. Just what we are observing now. There is a brief period in which course corrections remain possible. It may soon come to an end as U.S. democracy, such as it still is, continues on its self-destructive course."

    "output": "Appropriate comments surpass my limited literary skills. The blow is not only severe, but it may also be terminal for organized human life on earth, and for the innumerable other species that we are in the process of destroying with abandon. In the midst of the Ukraine crisis, the IPCC released its 2022 report, by far the most dire warning it has yet produced. The report made it very clear that we must take firm measures now, with no delay, to cut back the use of fossil fuels and to move toward renewable energy. The warnings received brief notice, and then our strange species returned to devoting scarce resources to destruction and rapidly increasing its poisoning of the atmosphere, while blocking efforts for extricating itself from its suicidal path. The fossil fuel industry can scarcely suppress its joy in the new opportunities the invasion has provided to accelerate its destruction of life on earth. In the U.S., the denialist party, which has successfully blocked Biden\u2019s limited efforts to deal with the existential crisis, is likely to be back in power soon, so that it can resume the dedication of the Trump administration to destroy everything as quickly and effectively as possible. These words might sound harsh. They are not harsh enough. The game is not over. There still is time for radical course correction. The means are understood. If the will is there, it is possible to avert catastrophe and to move on to a much better world. The invasion of Ukraine has indeed been a severe blow to these prospects. Whether it constitutes a terminal blow or not is for us to decide."

The knowledge and capability to use it were there, the will to employ them was not. The pharmaceutical industry, bloated with wealth, was not interested. Its concern is profit tomorrow, not the common good. Governments have the scientific and financial resources but are hobbled by the neoliberal dogma that decisions and plans have to be shifted to unaccountable private power. So little was done. We now face similar questions. We hear much the same warnings and advice from scientists as we did in 2003. The same institutional barriers stand in the way of averting the next and very likely more severe pandemic. We have the knowledge and capability.

In your view, how should we understand this?",
    "output": "We can understand that by going back four centuries to when the first slaves were brought. I don\u2019t want to have to run through the whole history, but the most vicious system of slavery in human history is the basis, large part of the basis for U.S. prosperity. Cotton was the oil of the 18th and 19th century. You had to have cheap cotton. You don\u2019t get that by following the rules they teach you in the economics department. You get it by vicious, brutal slavery. That\u2019s laid the basis for manufacturing, textile manufacturing, finance, commerce, retail, obviously, that went on through much of the 19th century. Well, finally, slavery was formally ended for about 10 years during the Reconstruction period. Then there was an agreement with the South that they could go on exactly the way they were before. So you get one of the best books on the topic calledSlavery by Another Name, measures taken to essentially criminalize the Black population. So the Black guy standing on a street corner, they fine him for vagrancy. He can\u2019t pay the fine. Okay, you go to a chain gang. End result was this great manufacturing revolution of the late 19th century, early 20th century, largely built on, it wasn\u2019t called slavery, but ownership of the Black population by the State. It\u2019s much better than slavery. If you have slaves, you have to keep them alive. Well, if you put them in prison, the government has to keep them alive. You just get them when you need them and there\u2019s no question of a lack of discipline or protest or anything like that. This went on almost until the Second World War. At that point there were jobs. People had to work. But then comes new forms of imposed slavery. So well into the late 1960s, federal housing laws required segregation. There was a lot of public-supported housing going on in the 50s. Levittowns and so on, but for whites, no Blacks. Liberal senators voted for this, hated it, but they voted for it because there was no other way to get any public housing passed. The United States had anti-miscegenation laws\u2014so severe that the Nazis refused to accept them\u2014into the \u201960s. Then it takes other forms. The Supreme Court just essentially did what the government did back at the end of Reconstruction, told the Southern states, you can do whatever you like. They eliminated the Voting Rights Act. We\u2019ve just seen this a couple of days ago in Wisconsin. Incredible. If you want to see democracy simply crushed, take a look what happened two days ago in Wisconsin. The governor sensibly wanted, a Democratic governor, wanted to delay the primary and extend absentee voting. I mean, nothing could make more perfect sense. There is a Republican-dominated legislature that had a small minority of votes, but gerrymandering gave them the largest number of seats in the Republican legislature. They called a session. I don\u2019t think the Republicans even bothered to show up. The Majority Leader simply called the session and closed it. Didn\u2019t consider the governor\u2019s proposal, supported by the Supreme Court. This is designed to ensure that poor minority voters, people who can\u2019t get the polls easily, mostly Democrats, won\u2019t vote. The rich, the traditional base of the ones who did all this, they vote. It\u2019s an open way, not even concealed, to try to ensure that no matter what the public wants, the most reactionary policies will be maintained permanently. [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is the evil genius behind this. He\u2019s been doing it beautifully. Make sure that the judiciary is stuffed with young, mostly unqualified, ultra-reactionary justices. That ensures that whatever the country wants in the future, they\u2019ll be able to kill it. Just like the Roberts Court, the majority is able to do it now. Republicans know that they\u2019re a minority party. There\u2019s no way to get votes on their actual programs. That\u2019s why they have to appeal to so-called cultural issues\u2014gun rights, abortion and so on\u2014not their actual policies, which are fill the pockets of the rich. That\u2019s the actual policy. Trump is a genius at this. Have to admire him. With one hand he says, \u201cI\u2019m your savior, I\u2019m working for the poor working guy.\u201d On the other hand he\u2019s stabbing him in the back. It\u2019s pretty impressive. He\u2019s most certainly the most successful con man in American history, ever. I presume it\u2019ll explode sometime, but so far it\u2019s maintaining itself. They\u2019re trying very hard to dismantle whatever elements of democracy there are. There are models elsewhere, [Prime Minister Viktor] Orb\u00e1n in Hungary is doing the same thing, one of their big friends. In fact, it\u2019s kind of interesting, it\u2019s pretty hard to identify a coherent geopolitical strategy from the chaos in the White House. But there is one that comes out with considerable clarity: form an international of the most reactionary states in the world, then let that be the basis for U.S. power. So [President Abdel Fattah el-]Sisi in Egypt, the worst tyrant in Egypt\u2019s history, the family dictators in Saudi Arabia, in particular MBS [Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman Al Saud], the biggest killer. Israel, which is going way to the right, is now at the center of it. Former tacit relations between Israel and the Arab states are now becoming open. [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi in India, what he\u2019s doing is simply unspeakable. He gave four hours\u2019 notice for the total lockdown. Most of the population in India is informal workers. They don\u2019t have anywhere to go. They can\u2019t stay home. There\u2019s no home. So they\u2019re trekking on the highways, maybe a thousand miles to some village somewhere, dying on the way. Impossible to imagine what this is going to do. But since they\u2019re mostly poor and many of them are Muslim, who cares? So he\u2019s a major part of this reactionary international. Nice guys like Orb\u00e1n in Hungary or the like. They love them. [Former Deputy Prime Minister Matteo] Salvini in Italy, one of the worst gangsters around. In the Western hemisphere the main representative is [President Jair] Bolsonaro in Brazil, who\u2019s vying with Trump to see who could be the worst criminal in the world. Trump easily can beat him because of U.S. power, but the policies are not much different and that\u2019s harming not just Brazil but the whole world. Current predictions in scientific journals are that in about 15 years the Amazon will shift from being a net carbon sink to a net carbon CO2 emitter. That\u2019s a disaster. All the result of extended gifts by Bolsonaro to the mining industries, the agribusinesses, all of his friends. So there are guys trying to create the next world. They\u2019re working hard. They always do. Their relentless, constant class war never stops and if they\u2019re allowed to win, we\u2019re toast."

From our viewpoint, we\u2019re seeing a lot of rank-and-file activity in the United States right now. Strikes are taking place in many locations. Workers are organizing in response to the coronavirus and being encouraged to work in unsafe conditions. Are the employers talking about that and are they worried about it?",
    "output": "Oh, boy, are they. In fact, as you know, every January, the guys who modestly call themselves the masters of the universe gather in Davos, Switzerland, to go skiing, talk about how wonderful they are and so on and so forth. This January meeting was very interesting. They see that the peasants are coming with the pitchforks and they\u2019re worried about it. So there\u2019s a shift. You look at the theme of the meeting, it\u2019s, \u201cYeah, we did bad things in the past. We now understand it. We\u2019re now opening a new era in capitalism, a new era in which we aren\u2019t just concerned with the stockholders, but with the workers and the population and we\u2019re such good guys, so humanist that you can entrust your faith to us. We\u2019ll make sure everything\u2019s fine.\u201d And it was pretty interesting to see what happened. There were two main speakers. This should be played in every classroom in the country. Two main speakers. Trump, of course, gave the keynote speech. Greta Thunberg gave the other speech. The contrast was fantastic. The first speech is this raving buffoon, screaming about how greedy he is and we can\u2019t even count up the number of the lies. The second speech is a 17-year-old girl quietly giving a factual, accurate description of what\u2019s happening in the world and looking these guys in the face and saying, \u201cYou\u2019re destroying our lives.\u201d And of course everyone politely claps. Nice little girl. Go back to school. The reaction to Trump was particularly interesting. They don\u2019t like him. His vulgarity and crudity is interfering with the image they\u2019re trying to project as dedicated humanists. But they love him. They gave him a round of upstanding applause and couldn\u2019t stop cheering. Because they understand something. This guy, no matter how vulgar he is, knows very well whose pockets to fill and how to fill them. So he can be a buffoon. We\u2019ll tolerate his antics as long as he continues with the policies that count. That\u2019s the Davos men. They didn\u2019t bother pointing out that we\u2019ve heard this tune before. Back in the 1950s it was called the soulful corporation. Corporations have become soulful. Now they\u2019re just overflowing with kindness for working people and everyone else. It\u2019s a new era. Well, we\u2019ve had some time to see how soulful they were, and this will continue. So either we can be taken in by the con and let it go, or you can fight back and create a different world. It\u2019s a very good opportunity for it now. The strikes that you mentioned, protests all over the world. There\u2019s community self-help groups forming. Neighborhoods, poor neighborhoods or people helping each other trying to do something for the elderly who are cooped up. Some of them are astounding. So go to Brazil, where the president is just a monstrosity. For him, the whole pandemic is just a cold. The Brazilians are immune to viruses. We\u2019re special people and so on and so forth. The government\u2019s doing nothing. Some of the governors are, but not the federal government. The worst of this is going to be in the, as everywhere, in the slums, the impoverished areas, the indigenous areas. The worst slums like thefavelasin Rio, the idea of washing your hands every couple of hours is a little difficult when you don\u2019t have water, or separating yourself when you\u2019re crammed into one room. But there is a group that came and tried to impose some reasonable standards as well as possible under these horrible conditions. Who? The crime gangs that have been terrorizing thefavelas. They\u2019re so powerful, the police are afraid to go in. They organized to try to deal with the health crisis. It tells you something, just like the nurses on the front line. There are human resources there and they can come to the fore in some of the most unexpected places. Not from the corporate sector, not from the wealthy, not from the soulful corporations. Certainly not from governments, particularly pathological ones like this. Others are doing better. But from popular action, that\u2019s the hope. Sanders, when he gave his withdrawal speech, emphasized this. He said the campaign may be ending, the movement isn\u2019t. It\u2019s up to especially his young supporters to put some meat into that, that it can be done. No matter what happens. Trump\u2019s reelected, it\u2019s an utter tragedy. Biden\u2019s elected, it won\u2019t be wonderful. But either way you\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s possible, and it\u2019s not out of reach."

Is it possible for the United States to move in this direction?",
    "output": "Sure. We\u2019ve done it before. I lived through the Depression. That\u2019s why I have this long white beard. But in the 1920s the labor movement was totally crushed. Take a look at David Montgomery, a labor historian, one of his great books isThe Fall of the House of Labor. He\u2019s talking about the \u201920s. It was crushed by the liberal Wilson administration, the Red Scare and all the rest. In the \u201930s it began to revive. The CIO organizing sit-down strikes, great threat to management, sit-down strike, workers are sitting there. Next thing that\u2019s going to come to their heads is, \u201cWe don\u2019t need the bosses. We can run this place ourselves.\u201d And then you\u2019re done. It\u2019s a very fragile system. Well, that led to reactions. There happened to be a sympathetic administration, which is critical. A very good labor historian, Erik Loomis, has studied case after case of this and he points out that moments of positive change have almost always been led by an active labor movement and the only times they succeeded were when there was a relatively sympathetic administration, at least a tolerant one. Well, you don\u2019t happen to have that now, but actually if Biden came in, not great, but he could be pushed. If the labor movement revives, the Sanders movement, which is very significant, he\u2019s achieved great successes, if that can take off, it could be, we once again could get out of the capitalist crises as was done in the \u201930s. The New Deal didn\u2019t end the Depression, the war did with massive state-directed production, but nevertheless it was much better than today. I\u2019m old enough to remember it and my family, extended family, were mostly first-generation working people, mostly unemployed living under poverty that is much worse than the working class today. But it was hopeful. There weren\u2019t depths of despair. There wasn\u2019t a feeling the world\u2019s coming to an end. The mood was, \u201cSomehow we\u2019ll get out of this together, working together.\u201d Some of them were in the Communist Party, some were in the labor unions. I had a couple of aunts who were unemployed seamstresses, but they were in ILGWU [International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union], which gave them a life, a cultural life, meetings, a week in the country, theater activities that were being carried out.

    "output": "There\u2019s a history, goes back 2500 years, back to the origins of recorded history, classical Greece, and the biblical records. Go back to Greece; there was a man [Socrates] who was accused of corrupting the youth of Athens by asking searching questions. His fate was to be killed with poison\u2014given the hemlock. In the biblical record, which is partly accurate, partly not, there were critical intellectuals\u2014the word that is used for them is prophets. That is a dubious translation of an obscure Hebrew phrase. What they were, if you look at what they were actually saying, were critics. They criticized the acts of the evil kings, they gave geopolitical analysis, warned that the policies were going to lead to disaster; they called for helping widows and orphans and so on. That is what today we call dissident intellectuals. What happened to them? They were imprisoned, driven into the desert, maligned; the worst of the Kings, King Ahab, condemned the Prophet Elijah as a hater of Israel because he was condemning the acts of the evil Kings\u2014it is probably the origin of the notion of anti-American and anti-Israel, and so on. And it goes the same way throughout history. Going up to modern times, the term intellectual, in the current sense, is really not used before the late 19thcentury. It came into use at the time of the Dreyfus trial in France, and Emile Zola and others who supported Dreyfus and condemned the state and the military. They were critical intellectuals [who] were bitterly condemned by the mainstream of the intellectual classes. Zola himself had to flee France for his life. That is the treatment of dissidents. Shortly after that came the First World War, which was very striking, a lot of commentary on it now since it is the centenary. One of the most interesting things is the reaction of intellectuals. On every side, the intellectual classes lined up passionately in support of their own state. In Germany, there was a manifesto of 93 leading intellectuals instructing the civilized world that Germany is defending the great cultural legacy of Beethoven, Immanuel Kant, and so on, and the world should join them\u2014on the Western side, the same. There were critics, [such as] Bertrand Russell in England, Rosa Luxembourg, Karl Liebknecht in Germany, Eugene Debs in the United States; they were put in jail. That is intellectuals."

Actually, there were penalties, but they were self-induced. I was involved extensively in civil disobedience, resistance, came pretty close to a long jail sentence, but I can\u2019t call that repression\u2014it was things I was doing consciously. I know people like Norman Finkelstein, he faced certain consequences; he was not able to get tenure at his university. It is a special case. It is a very rotten one, but it is a special case. Norman Finkelstein exposed the dishonest criminality of a Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, who went berserk, and tried in any way he could think of to destroy Finkelstein to the point of\u2014I can go through the details\u2014but it was Dershowitz\u2019s jihad to try to protect himself. He knew that he could not answer Finkelstein\u2019s criticisms. So the way he picked was to try vilification, denunciation, massive efforts to prevent him from getting tenure, and yes, so that happened. It is a rotten case, but it is a special case. Pre-Modern Society Pre-modern society\u2014pre-modern means not having assimilated and accepted the basic values of the enlightenment and since\u2014and that\u2019s a large part of the Western world. Take the United States, leader of the free world, most powerful state in human history, supposedly a beacon of freedom and enlightenment. Take, say, global warming, one of the major problems humans have ever faced, it is hard to convince people in the United States it is a real problem. The reason\u201440 percent of the population thinks it can\u2019t be a problem because Jesus is coming in a few decades. Is that pre-modern? Yeah, it is pre-modern. It is a culturally conservative society\u2014pre-modern in many respects. Take Europe\u2014Austria and Germany\u2014two countries which evoke some memories from the 1930s. In Austria, a neo-Nazi party is likely to take the Presidency. In Germany, ultra-right nationalist party with neofascist tendencies is defeating the mainstream Merkel party in local elections. Is that pre-modern? Was Nazism pre-modern? Depends what you mean by modern. If you mean by that not having assimilated the fundamental values that were brought forth during the enlightenment and since, yes, much of the world is pre-modern. In fact, take a phenomenon that is taking place right at this moment. There is a conference in Morocco, as you know, the COP22 conference. It is an international effort to put some teeth in the global warming agreements. What is happening at COP22 is that the values and hopes of civilization are being upheld by China\u2014a harsh authoritarian state is in the lead in trying to mobilize support to deal with this massive problem. The United States, the leader of the free world, is at the end of the line trying to draw the train backwards. It is an astonishing phenomenon, and it is not commented on. Ethnic Conflict"

There have been many cases where terminal nuclear war was extremely close and the threat is in fact increasing now. Religious-Nation State"

That is saying that our society recognizes two categories of citizens, \u201cthe privileged categories\u201d and the \u201cothers\u201d, and that violates the most elementary principles of democratic freedom. I should say if these designations are just symbolic, maybe it does not matter.

The Schengen agreement, which permits free passage among the countries of Europe, is a step towards a more tolerant and civilized society; it is a kind of federalism. It has positive and negative aspects because of the way it is implemented. Because of the way it was integrated into the Eurozone\u2014which is something separate from the EU\u2014it has led to a situation where sovereignty has passed from populations to the bureaucracy in Brussels with the German banks hanging over their shoulders. That is where basic decisions are made. It does not matter who people elect for their own government, the major decisions are out of their hands. That has led to extreme resentment\u2014justified resentment\u2014taking self-destructive paths, but the resentment is understandable. That is part of the background for the rise of the ultra-right parties which appeal to the population on the grounds that they no longer control their own destiny.

Genocide meant what the Nazis did to the Jews, for example. That was genocide. By now the term is used so broadly that people even talk about committing genocide against five people, or a massacre somewhere with a couple hundred people is called genocide. And in fact, it is used in a very restrictive way. We use the term genocide to refer to the atrocities committed by someone else, not our own. Let us take a real case\u2014the Clinton and Blair sanctions on Iraq\u2014that actually was called genocide by the distinguished international diplomats who administered the oil for food program, the so-called \u201chumanitarian\u201d aspect of the sanctions. Denis Halliday, who resigned in protest, because he said they are genocidal, and Hans von Sponeck, who followed him, resigned on the grounds that the [sanctions] amounted to genocide. Hans von Sponeck, in fact, published a detailed book about it calledA Different Kind of War. They did condemn the sanctions as genocidal. What was the result? Try to find a copy of von Sponeck\u2019s book. Try to find a reference to it. Try to find a review. Try to find anything. This is wiped out of western commentary.

Same was done in Central America, Brazil, and East Timor. Take East Timor, which was, if the term genocide has any meaning, what Indonesia did in East Timor, with the backing of the United States, Britain, other western countries, even Sweden, that comes about as close to genocide as anything since the Second World War. East Timor, finally, won its independence. Should they carry out war crimes trials against Indonesia, Australia, United States, and others?

They have a reservation in Cape Cod and naturally, should they institute war crime trials against the people who live in their homes? It would not make a lot of sense. It would make a lot of sense to bring out understanding of what happened to call for reparations and so on, but not war crimes trials. It just means nothing in these circumstances. Is it genocide? The population of this territorial United States, the time the colonists arrived, nobody knows for sure, maybe 10 million or something like that. By 1900, when there was census, there were about 200,000. The Western hemisphere had about 80 million people when Columbus arrived, and pretty soon about 90 percent of them were gone. Anarchism"

I mean, you spent 60, 70 years in universities now, and do you think that a substantial portion of what is done in these places is just a waste of time or is empty nonsense?NC: First of all, there\u2019s very serious work done. So I think the universities are probably the best institutions in our society, so I\u2019m going to be critical, but we should recognize the value. They are unique. They\u2019re the one place where you do really have some degree of openness and ability to question and pursue your own interests and concerns. There is nothing really comparable. On the other hand, some of the things that happen are unbelievable. So I\u2019ll just give you an example. In the 1960s, I was at MIT. I started teaching undergraduate courses on my own time, on social and political issues. It\u2019s not what I was hired for, so I used my own time. Good classes. Lots of students came. It was quite interesting. My co-instructor and I once \u2014 this must have been \u201968 or so \u2014 decided to assign Henry Kissinger\u2019s book, which had just appeared, on American foreign policy. This was quite an experience. The students were rolling in the aisles. You cannot expect MIT undergraduates to read an essay, in which the theme is that there\u2019s a lot of people who worry about the superficial, peripheral things like wars, and famine, and torture and so on. But the real issue in the world is the fundamental divide between the West, which underwent the Newtonian Revolution, and therefore knows that there\u2019s a world external to the observer, and the rest of them who haven\u2019t quite mastered this. And then he said the Russians have got a foot in each camp. They\u2019ve sort of half made it. So the implication would be that when you bomb the North Vietnamese, they maybe think it\u2019s a headache, because they don\u2019t know there\u2019s a world out there. I mean, can you expect MIT undergraduates to read that? No. But is he a senior professor at Harvard, highly recognized? Well, sure."

But they overlook some not very obscure facts. So let\u2019s turn around to the television. If you took an economics course, one thing you learned, Econ 101, is that markets are based on informed consumers making rational choices. Okay? Did anybody ever notice that industry in the United States, one of the hugest industries in the country spends billions and billions of dollars trying to create uninformed consumers who make irrational choices.

No. What you see is some football hero, or model, standing on a car which is going into the air into the stratosphere \u2014 anything to make you uninformed and irrational. So what are we talking about?",

NR: I want to get back to universities and academia. I was looking at the syllabus you have for the course you have here called \u201cWhat Is Politics?\u201d You know, I was a political science, political theory undergrad, and when they asked a question within this course of \u201cWhat Is Politics?\u201d you would begin with The Republic, and then you would do Locke and Rousseau, and you begin sort of with capitalist realism and the threats of nuclear war and climate change as \u201cWhat Is Politics?\u201d I understand that approach, because those are things that matter, and politics is about things that matter. But does that mean that \u2014 how would you reconfigure political science to actually have insight into what politics is?NC: Well I think a lot of political science has great insight into it. So let\u2019s take the conception that the United States is a democracy. A democracy is presumably a society in which the general population has a voice in how decisions are made, about social, economic, and political conditions. Now let\u2019s take a look at serious political science research. What does it show? There\u2019s very good work on this. So my close friend, Thomas Ferguson, has done leading political science. NR: The Golden Rule.NC: The Golden Rule. He\u2019s done remarkable work showing very persuasively, up until the present moment \u2014 Golden Rule is years ago. He\u2019s carried forward, up until the present, you can predict the outcome of an election with remarkable precision by simply looking at campaign spending, one variable. Well, there\u2019s a corollary of that. \u201cElected representatives\u201d assumes they\u2019re elected. The first thing they have to do is appeal to the donor class \u2014 somebody in the house of representatives may spend five or six hours a day just calling the donors. And meanwhile, what happens to the legislation? Well, the lobbyists come in from the corporations. They meet with the staff. They of course overwhelm the staff with information and background, and they basically write the legislation \u2014 a fact that\u2019s been studied by other fine political scientists who have showed very convincingly that a large majority of the population are literally disenfranchised, meaning their own representatives pay no attention to their preferences. They listen to other voices, and we know which voices those are. Is this a functioning democracy? Well, you take a look at the Economist Intelligence Unit and they just did a big study on democracies throughout the world, and they regard the United States as a flawed democracy. NR: That\u2019s generous.NC: I think it\u2019s ranked 25th among the democracies of the world. But it\u2019s ranked that high only because of the narrowness of the conditions that they use. They don\u2019t ask these questions. They\u2019re just asking \u201cdoes the president lie\u201d or something like that. But if you look at the actual basic features of the society, you see something very different than what\u2019s commonly believed. And just like this matter of \u201cmarkets responding to informed consumers making rational choices,\u201d everywhere you look you find this. When you begin to look into the specific details, it\u2019s extremely revealing. So take the gun culture in the United States, fanaticism about filling your closet with a half a dozen assault rifles, and so on. Where did this come from? Well, it turns out, there\u2019s good studies of it. These are things that can be studied. There\u2019s a woman, named Pamela Haag, who did a very good study on the origins of the gun culture. Turns out that after the Civil War, the gun manufacturers had lost their market. There was no gun culture in the 19th century. The gun was like a tool, like a shovel. A farmer had a gun to keep critters away from his sheep, or something, and the farmers \u2014 it was an agricultural society, they didn\u2019t want these fancy guns that the gun manufacturers were producing. So you could sell some abroad, and so on, but there wasn\u2019t much of a market. So they started what is probably the first major public relations campaign in modern American history to try to create the image of the \u201cWild West,\u201d in which noble cowboys had pistols. They were fighting off the bad guys and shooting faster than someone else. All of this is total fantasy. There was nothing like it. Cowboys were kind of the people at the fringe of society who couldn\u2019t get a job, so someone would hire them to push their cows around. It\u2019s not wild. And then comes along the things that were later imitated by the tobacco industry \u2014 the Marlboro Man, and so on. \u201cYour son won\u2019t be a man unless he has a Winchester rifle. Your daughter has to have a pink revolver to defend herself.\u201d Pretty soon you have a gun culture. Is it because people wanted guns? It was a created \u2014 it was what Thorstein Veblen, a little over a century ago, called \u201cfabricating wants.\u201d It\u2019s a large part of the society. Then the supreme court comes along in 2008 with the theHellerdecision, written by Scalia, a great originalist. It\u2019s a very interesting decision worth reading. If you read his decision, you notice that he avoids all the reasons why the founders wanted people to have guns. Actually, it\u2019s a very learned decision. He is a great scholar, quotes all sorts of documents from the 17th century and so on. But we know exactly why the founders wanted people to have guns. The first one was, there was almost no standing army. And the British are hovering around. They\u2019re the big enemy. Suppose they attack again. Well, you know, we\u2019re going to have to have guys with guns. We can form a well-regulated militia, that\u2019s the first phrase in the Second Amendment. That\u2019s one. Second is, with the British out of the way, we can now expand into the west, into what was called \u201cvacant territory,\u201d so we have to go out there and kill the people who are living in this vacant territory \u2014 attack the Indian nations. In fact, the United States is one of the rare countries in the world that\u2019s been at war since the first day of its founding \u2014 attacking, and for that, you needed guns. And also, it\u2019s a slave society. There\u2019s a lot of slaves around, not many people controlling them. Got to have guns. There are slave revolutions taking place in the Caribbean. They could extend here, and they pretty soon did in Haiti. You got to have guns. Take a look at Scalia\u2019s decision. Are any of these things mentioned? Not a word. There are debates in the law profession about whether the Second Amendment conveys a militia right, or an individual right. Okay, you can debate that, but it\u2019s kind of beside the point. The point is: The Second Amendment, as the founders understood it, is irrelevant in the 21st century. But that\u2019s considered holy writ. Well, as soon as you begin to look at the actual world, the illusions collapse pretty quickly. And going back to \u201cWhat Is Politics?\u201d that\u2019s what the study of it should be. So we actually start the course by talking about Gramsci and hegemonic common sense, and asking how it\u2019s established, what\u2019s its basis, what happens when we investigate it, and so on. And I think that\u2019s what a \u201cWhat Is Politics?\u201d course ought to be about."

To finish then, talking about illusions, I think, for me, your writings have been very important to me since I was a teenager, and to a lot of people who have had the same experiences. And I think one of the common reasons for that is that it is difficult to see through illusions, and it can make you feel like you\u2019re crazy in many ways. As I was walking through campus today, I was thinking about a sentence of yours, which was that \u201ctens of millions of people have been killed by what is taught in American economics departments,\u201d which is just factually true. But then you look and the campus is idyllic, and all the students going about, doing their readings of Heidegger, and Nietzsche, learning philosophy, and learning politics, and you feel sort of out of your mind if you think that there\u2019s something sort of not quite real here, or there\u2019s something different between the real world, and everything that\u2019s around me.NC: Most of these, I don\u2019t think are hard to expose. It\u2019s true that you kind of reflexively just accept what you\u2019ve heard. Actually, Orwell has a nice comment about this in \u2014 did you ever read the introduction to Animal Farm?",

Well in it, he\u2019s talking about how in free England, ideas can be suppressed without the use of force. And he doesn\u2019t say much about the reasons, but one of them I think is much to the point. He says, basically, that if you\u2019ve had a good education, you\u2019ve gone to Oxford, and Cambridge, and so on, you just have instilled into you the understanding that there\u2019s certain things that do to say \u201che didn\u2019t go far enough.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t do to think. You just can\u2019t think them. Because the education instills into you the common sense of the day. And it\u2019s not really hard to break out of it. You have to be willing to do the kind of thing that actually led to modern science. So you go back to the time of say, Galileo, neo-scholastic physics more or less had an answer for everything. You know, objects fall because they\u2019re going to their natural place, steam rises for the same reason, perception is a matter of the object moving through space and implanting it in your brain, and so on. Galileo and his contemporaries made a breakthrough. They decided to be puzzled about these things. Somebody decides to be puzzled, you find everything\u2019s wrong. Just the willingness to ask yourself, \u201clook, everybody believes it, is it true?\u201d In fact, there\u2019s kind of a rule of thumb, if everybody believes something, and it\u2019s a contentious issue, something should light up in your brain, and say \u201cyou better ask about this. It\u2019s probably not true.\u201d And as soon as you make that simple move, all sorts of things open up. Modern science opened up, and the kinds of things we\u2019ve been talking about now open up. NR: That\u2019s funny, because you know, on the surface, that\u2019s like the definition of a crazy person. If everyone says something is true, if it\u2019s the established consensus, the idea of being the only one who thinks something and wonders something, it\u2019s very lonely."

    "input": "Idan Landau:Most liberals would scoff at what they perceive as the naivet\u00e9 of Rudolph Rocker\u2019s ideas. Yet anarchist ideas constantly feed social movements and are sometimes even put to practice. The most impressive anarchist experiment of the last decade, to my mind, is the autonomy of Rojava in northeastern Syria: a multiethnic egalitarian, feminist, and environmentally conscious confederate of communities, explicitly opposed to the nation-state model and directly inspired by the anarchist ideas of Murray Bookchin. The Rojava autonomy, which includes some 4-5 million residents, has become a beacon to progressive activists worldwide, much like the Zapatistas in the Chiapas two decades earlier. But now Rojava is under fierce attack by the Turkish military, following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region. Whether this radical experiment will survive is unclear at the moment, and one can\u2019t avoid thinking of the downfall of the Catalonia anarchist communities in the Spanish Civil War (also abandoned by the West to fascist forces). Can you comment on the general issue\u2014the prospects of a true anarchist society in today\u2019s world, where local communities are so vastly dwarfed by military and economic superpowers (e.g., oil companies), and also on the particular case of Rojava?",
    "output": "They might scoff, but their classical liberal predecessors would not have, from Locke through Humboldt and on to Abraham Lincoln and John Stuart Mill. Nor working people in the early industrial revolution. These topics are discussed a bit in chapter 3 of WKC, and much more elsewhere. There is, I think, considerable merit in Rocker\u2019s argument that the anarchist tradition that he espoused is the natural inheritor of the ideals of classical liberalism, after they foundered on the shoals of industrial capitalism. I think you are quite right that like Marx\u2019s old mole, the basic ideas that motivated classical liberalism and its left libertarian (anarchist) offshoots are burrowing just below the surface, constantly ready to emerge in some form (and not to be confused with U.S. \u201clibertarianism,\u201d profoundly antilibertarian in my view). And I also agree that what has been accomplished in Rojava is quite remarkable, particularly in the context of a murderous war in which domestic forces and foreign participants show no mercy. Trump\u2019s betrayal of the Kurds who fought the U.S.-backed ground war against ISIS (suffering 11,000 deaths as compared to a half dozen Americans), handing them over to their vicious Turkish and Syrian enemies, is a despicable crime\u2014and also a welcome gift to ISIS, offering them the kind of \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card that they used to organize in the first place. Regrettably, Trump\u2019s savagery is nothing new. It has been virtually a requirement of office for American leaders to betray the Kurds shamefully in the \u201cnational interest,\u201d ever since Kissinger and President Ford, dramatically including Reagan and Clinton. The disgrace is mostly suppressed in Western discourse, but it is all too real. Perhaps some elements of the \u201cradical experiment\u201d in Rojava will survive, but the prospects seem dim as the Kurds are caught between the forces of their traditional Turkish oppressors with their jihadi clients and the sadistic Assad regime\u2014and soon, very likely, reconstituted ISIS forces given a new lease on life by Trump. For the moment their \u201cprotectors\u201d are primarily the Russians, hardly a safe harbor. I presume that the Kurdish leadership, having little alternative, will try to reach some temporary accommodation with Assad under the Russian aegis, as they have already been doing. Not an attractive prospect. Elements of anarchist societies exist quite widely, some large-scale and successful over a long term. The Mondragon worker-owned conglomerate in the Basque country is the most notable example, flourishing for over sixty years. It is not an anarchist society and could hardly be in a state capitalist world. But worker\u2019s control of production is an essential element of the classical liberal-left socialist-anarchist ideal, one component of the demand that structures of authority and domination have to justify themselves, and if they cannot (like the labor contract), then they should be dismantled in favor of structures that are more free and just. To go beyond will require dismantling of oppressive institutions on a much broader scale\u2014at the very least, undermining the ability of the great powers to destroy upstart exercises of freedom and justice, a leading theme of history to the present. They do not always succeed, at least completely. That is why we can discern an element of truth in Martin Luther King\u2019s famous phrase that \u201cthe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\u201d But not without serious regression, and not by itself. The moral arc only bends somewhat toward justice when it is pressed hard in that direction by dedicated, committed effort. That is no less true right now than it has always been. Neither you nor I have to look far to see bitter signs of that elementary truth. And we are hardly alone. It is imperative to add a critical matter too often overlooked\u2014though not by Israeli scientists. They conclude that the questions we are discussing, while perhaps of intellectual interest, hardly matter, because if Israel continues on its present course, along with selected others, the region will soon be mostly unlivable. But there\u2019s good news for Israel. One Israeli climate scientist observes that Israel \u201cis not expected to be submerged anytime soon,\u201d only most of it; Ramallah should have a little more time than most of Israel. More good news is that \u201ccities are liable to be abandoned in Iran, Iraq and in developing countries, but in our country it will be possible to live.\u201d And although the temperature of the Mediterranean may approach 40oC, \u201cthe maximum permitted temperature in a Jacuzzi,\u201d nevertheless \u201chumans will not be boiled alive like sea urchins and red-mouthed rock shells, but there could be mortal danger during the height of the bathing season.\u201d The essential observation is made by Professor Alon Tal: \u201cWe are aggravating the condition of the planet. The Jewish state has looked humanity\u2019s ultimate challenge in the eyes and said: \u2018Forget it.\u2019 What will we tell our children? That we wanted a higher quality of living? That we had to remove all the natural gas from the sea because it was so economically profitable? Those are pathetic explanations. We\u2019re talking about the most fateful issue there is, especially in the Mediterranean Basin, and the government of Israel isn\u2019t capable of appointing a minister who cares that we are simply going to be cooked.\u201d Of course, all of this holds, much more significantly, for the arch-criminals in Washington on whom Israel has chosen to rely for survival in defiance of any moderately humane elements in the world. If we can be honest, we will recognize that Trump and the political party that he now virtually owns are the most dangerous organization in human history, dedicated with passion to destroying the prospects for organized human life on earth by maximizing the use of fossil fuels. All of this in full knowledge of what they are doing, seeking destruction of human society on a scale that Hitler never contemplated in order to cram more dollars into overstuffed pockets and to retain power as long as anything remains to control."

    "output": "Some of the earliest assumptions, then tentative and only partially formed, have proven quite robust, among them that the human language capacity is a species property in a double sense: virtually uniform among humans apart from serious pathology, and unique to humans in its essential properties. The most basic property of the language faculty is that each internal language generates an unbounded array of structured expressions, each of which yields an interpretation at the interface with other cognitive systems (basically a linguistically-articulated thought) and can be externalized in some sensorimotor system, usually speech, in ways that allow others to access our thoughts \u2013 a property of language that Galileo and his contemporaries rightly regarded with awe and wonder. Basic ideas about the mechanisms that have these remarkable properties have also proven fairly stable, though there has been great progress in refining them and reducing them to principles simple enough to provide sound explanations for many surprising aspects of language and to suggest a plausible evolutionary scenario. From the outset, 65 years ago, the languages investigated closely were typologically varied, and in tandem with theoretical advances inquiry has proceeded to unprecedented typological range and depth."

    "output": "I don\u2019t find these broad-brush observations very helpful or informative. The devil is in the details. There is work on these matters that seems to me much more compelling. In his very important study on the rise and fall of American growth, Robert Gordon observes that there was virtually no economic growth for millennia until 1770, slow growth for another century, and then a \u201cspecial century\u201d until 1970, dependent largely on specific inventions. Since the 1970s the picture is much more mixed: in the US, with actual decline in real wages for non-supervisory workers over 40 years and even increased death rates in recent years. These are among the features of the neoliberal era that have led to the rise of the kind of \u201cmorbid symptoms\u201d that Gramsci warned about from Mussolini\u2019s prison cell, as we see all too clearly in the western world today. Elsewhere we find different patterns. Thus Russia suffered severe economic decline and demographic collapse when market reforms were introduced in the \u201890s. China has been different again. As Amartya Sen has shown, Maoist China saved about 100 million people \u2013 not a small number \u2013 as compared with democratic capitalist India from independence to 1980, not from \u201cenlightenment\u201d in the usual sense, but from rural health programs and other reforms. And since then it has undergone spectacular growth and provided the bulk of the reduction in global poverty, in a society that\u2019s not a model of enlightened values. Nazi Germany experienced very rapid growth in the \u201830s, not a triumph of enlightenment. There are numerous other complexities that are of major significance, but that disappear in unanalyzed statistical tables. As for \u201cmoral growth,\u201d there are even greater complexities. The American Revolution introduced the novel and important idea (put aside the fact) that \u201cwe the people\u201d should take control of our fate \u2013- and at the same time developed the most vicious system of slavery in human history, the foundation of much of US-British wealth and economic development. Or take Germany again. In the 1920s, it was at the peak of western civilization in the arts, the sciences and mathematics, and even political development, regarded as a model of democracy. Ten years later it was descending to the depths of human savagery. A decade later it was recovering what had been lost. As for the Enlightenment and modern science, no serious analyst can question their major achievements \u2013 or overlook their role in the age of discovery that brought untold horrors to much of the world, devastating the Western Hemisphere and Africa, crushing the leading world centers of civilization in India and China. With all that, a good case can be made I think that moral horizons are, overall, slowly widening, including recent years, when the activism of the \u201860s has had a considerable civilizing effect in many areas."

Or take his colleagues, the participants in the 2016 Republican primaries. Without exception, they either denied that what is happening is happening \u2013 though any ignorance is self-induced \u2013 or said maybe it is but we shouldn\u2019t do anything about it. The moral depths were reached by the respected \u201cadult in the room,\u201d Ohio governor John Kasich, who agreed that it is happening but added that \u201cwe are going to burn [coal] in Ohio and we are not going to apologize for it.\u201d Or take a recent publication of Trump\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a detailed study recommending an end to regulations on emissions. It presented a rational argument: extrapolating current trends, by the end of the century we\u2019ll be over the cliff and automotive emissions don\u2019t contribute very much to the catastrophe \u2013 the assumption being that everyone is as criminally insane as we are and won\u2019t try to avoid the crisis. In brief, let\u2019s rob while the planet burns, putting poor Nero in the shadows. This surely qualifies as a contender for the most evil document in history. There have been many monsters in the past, but it would be hard to find one who was dedicated to undermining the prospects for organized human society, not in the distant future \u2014 in order to put a few more dollars in overstuffed pockets. And it doesn\u2019t end there. The same can be said about the major banks that are increasing investments in fossil fuels, knowing very well what they are doing. Or, for that matter, the regular articles in the major media and business press reporting US success in rapidly increasing oil and gas production, with commentary on energy independence, sometimes local environmental effects, but regularly without a phrase on the impact on global warming \u2013 a truly existential threat. Same in the election campaign. Not a word about the issue that is merely the most crucial one in human history. Hardly a day passes without new information about the severity of the threat. As I\u2019m writing, a new study appeared inNatureshowing that retention of heat in the oceans has been greatly underestimated, meaning that the total carbon budget is much less than had been assumed in the recent, and sufficiently ominous, IPCC report. The study calculates that maximum emissions would have to be reduced by 25% to avoid warming of 2 degrees (C), well above the danger point. At the same time polls show that \u2014 doubtless influenced by their leaders who they trust more than the evil media \u2014 half of Republicans deny that global warming is even taking place, and of the rest, almost half reject any human responsibility. Words fail."

    "output": "Nixon had a mixed record. In some respects, he was the last liberal president: OSHA and EPA for example. On the other hand, he committed terrible crimes. Arguably the worst was the bombing of rural Cambodia, a proposed article of impeachment but voted down though it was incomparably more important than the others. And the article was much too weak, focusing on the secrecy. There has been little attention to the orders that Nixon delivered, relayed to the Pentagon by his faithful servant Henry Kissinger: \u201cA massive bombing campaign in Cambodia. Anything that flies on anything that moves.\u201d It is not easy to find comparable orders for genocide in the archival record. But all of Nixon\u2019s crimes pale in comparison with the decision to race towards the precipice of environmental catastrophe."

    "output": "Both. Generalizations are misleading; too much depends on specific circumstances. But some have a fair degree of validity, I think. One is that there is both justification and pressing need for radical changes in the socioeconomic and political orders. We cannot know to what extent they can be achieved by incremental reforms, which are to be valued on their own. But unless the great mass of the population comes to believe that needed change cannot be implemented within the existing system, resort to \u201cdrastic measures\u201d is likely to be a recipe for disaster."

    "output": "Surprised, yes.I\u2019d expected a strong reaction from Trump\u2019s voting base, raised to a fever pitch by his latest antics.But hadn\u2019t expectedthe attempted coup to reachthis levelof violence, and I suspect most of the participants didn\u2019t either. Many seemed to have been caught up in the excitement of the moment when the leaders of the crowd surged into the hated Capitol to drive out the demons who were not just\u201cstealing the election\u201dbut\u201cstealing\u201dtheir country from them: theirwhite Christiancountry. That it was an attempted coup is not in question.It was openly and proudlyproclaimed as just that.It was an attempt to overturnan elected government. That\u2019sa coup.True, what was attempted was not the kind of coup regularly backed byWashington in its dependencies, a military takeover with ample bloodshed, torture, \u201cdisappearance.\u201d But,nevertheless,it wasan attempted coup.True, the perpetrators regarded themselves as defending the legitimate government, but that\u2019s the norm, even for the most vicious and murderous coups, like the U.S.-backed coup in Chile on thefirst 9/11\u2014which wasactually much worse in virtually every dimension than the second one,the one thatweremember andcommemorate.The first one is best forgotten on the principle of \u201cwrong agents\u201d:Us, not some radical Islamicfundamentalists. The emotionsof those attempting the[Capitol]coupwereapparent.Belief that the election was stolen was plainlyheld with real fervor.Anditis understandableamong people who live in passionatelypro-Trump areaswhere he is reveredastheir savior, and for some,evenchosen by God,as heoncedeclared.Manymayscarcelyhaveseen a Biden sign, or heardanythingfromFox Newsor Rush Limbaughto suggest some possible flaw in theirbeliefs. Insome respects,these beliefs are not asbizarreas theymaylookat first. A shift of tens of thousands of votes in a few countiesmighthave swung the election the other way in a deeply undemocratic systemsuch asours,where 7 million votes can be swept asidealong withanunknown number of otherseliminated by purging, gerrymandering, andthemany other devicesthat have been devisedto steal the election from the \u201cwrong people,\u201deffectively authorized by the Supreme Court in its shameful 2013 decision nullifying the Voting Rights Act (Shelby County v. Holder). As we\u2019ve discussed before, the malevolent figure in charge deserves credit for his talent in tappingthe poisonous streamsthatrunnot far below the surface of American society, with sources thataredeep inU.S.history and culture. I have to say that I was also surprised by the quick reaction ofthosewho own the country andhave a large share ofresponsibilityfor the malaise that broke forth on January 6.Inno small part, it is a consequence of theneoliberal assault since Reagan,amplified by his successors,that has devastated the rural areas that are the homes of many who stormed the Capitol.Those who hold the levers of the private powerthat dominates the society and political systemnever liked Trump\u2019sbehavior, which harmed the image they project as humanists dedicated to the common good.But theywere willing to tolerate thevulgar performanceas long asTrumpand his accomplicesdelivered the goods,lining their pockets byrobbing the public. And that they did.The \u201ctransfer of wealth\u201dfrom the lower 90percentto the ultra-richsince Reagan opened thedoors for highway robberyreachesalmost $50 trillion, according to arecentRand corporation study.Noonecan place numbers on the vastly greater cost of environmental destruction that was a high priority of the Trump-McConnell yearsofservice to the very rich and corporate sector. But January6 was apparently too much, and the marching orders were delivered swiftly by the Big Guns. One has to have some sympathy for the legislators caught betweenpowerful contending forces.On the one hand,they seethe angry hordes whipped to a frenzy by Trump\u2019s performances, and still in his pocket, poised to wreak vengeance on those who betray their leader.Andon the other hand,looking down on them from above,arethe captains of finance and industry who fund their elections and dangle before them many other privilegesto keep them in line.(Howmany membersof Congress leave office to become truck drivers or secretaries?) The dilemma is particularly harsh forsenators,who aremore reliant on the large donors.And theirdefection from the ranksof obsequious Trump loyalists has beensomewhat greater."

    "output": "An attempted putsch, though the connotations of the termputschmay be too strong. The events reminded many, including historians of fascism, of Hitler\u2019s failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, which actually did not so easily penetrate the centers of power as the attempted coup of January 6. The reasons for the security failures are being debated. I have no special insight.Black members of the Capitol police, who showed great courage along with many of their white colleagues, have charged for years that the force has been infiltrated with white supremacists.There may have been some collusion, and possibly serious corruption higher up the chain of command."

Robert Drinan, S.J., charginghimwith the bombing of Cambodia, a truly monstrous crime,of Nuremberg Trial caliber.That charge was struck down by Congress.The prime charge against Nixon was that he organized thugs to invade one of two seats of political power in the country, the Democratic Party headquarters.

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: The political culture in the United States seems to have a propensity toward alarmism when it comes to political developments that are not in tune with the economic interests, ideological mindset and strategic interests of the powers-that-be. Indeed, from the anti-Spanish panic of the late 1890s to today\u2019s rage about Russia\u2019s security concerns over Ukraine, and China\u2019s growing role in world affairs and everything in between, the political establishment and the media of this country tend to respond with full-blown alarm to developments that are not in alignment with U.S. interests, values and goals. Can you comment about this peculiar state of affairs, with particular emphasis on what\u2019s happening today in connection with Ukraine and China?",
    "output": "Quite true. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to believe. One of the most significant and revealing examples is the rhetorical framework of the major internal planning document of the early Cold War years, NSC-68 of 1950, shortly after \u201cthe loss of China,\u201d which set off a frenzy in the U.S. The document set the stage for huge expansion of the military budget. It\u2019s worth recalling today when strains of this madness are reverberating \u2014 not for the first time; it\u2019s perennial. The policy recommendations of NSC-68 have been widely discussed in scholarship, though avoiding the hysterical rhetoric. It reads like a fairytale: ultimate evil confronted by absolute purity and noble idealism. On one side is the \u201cslave state\u201d with its \u201cfundamental design\u201d and inherent \u201ccompulsion\u201d to gain \u201cabsolute authority over the rest of the world,\u201d destroying all governments and the \u201cstructure of society\u201d everywhere. Its ultimate evil contrasts with our sheer perfection. The \u201cfundamental purpose\u201d of the United States is to assure \u201cthe dignity and worth of the individual\u201d everywhere. Its leaders are animated by \u201cgenerous and constructive impulses, and the absence of covetousness in our international relations,\u201d which is particularly evident in the traditional domains of U.S. influence, the Western hemisphere, long the beneficiary of Washington\u2019s tender solicitude as its inhabitants can testify. Anyone familiar with history and the actual balance of global power at the time would have reacted to this performance with utter bewilderment. Its State Department authors couldn\u2019t have believed what they were writing. Some later gave an indication of what they were up to. Secretary of State Dean Acheson explained in his memoirs that in order to ram through the huge planned military expansion, it was necessary to \u201cbludgeon the mass mind of \u2018top government\u2019\u201d in ways that were \u201cclearer than truth.\u201d The highly influential Sen. Arthur Vandenberg surely understood this as well when advising [in 1947] that the government must \u201cscare the hell out of the American people\u201d to rouse them from their pacifist backwardness. There are many precedents, and the drums are beating right now with warnings about American complacency and naivete about the intentions of the \u201cmad dog\u201d Putin to destroy democracy everywhere and subdue the world to his will, now in alliance with the other \u201cGreat Satan,\u201d Xi Jinping. The February 4 Putin-Xi summit, timed with the opening of the Olympic games, was recognized to be a major event in world affairs. Its review in a major article inThe New York Timesis headlined \u201cA New Axis,\u201d the allusion unconcealed. The review reported the intentions of the reincarnation of the Axis powers: \u201cThe message that China and Russia have sent to other countries is clear,\u201d David Leonhardt writes. \u201cThey will not pressure other governments to respect human rights or hold elections.\u201d And to Washington\u2019s dismay, the Axis is attracting two countries from \u201cthe American camp,\u201d Egypt and Saudi Arabia, stellar examples of how the U.S. respects human rights and elections in its camp \u2014 by providing a massive flow of weapons to these brutal dictatorships and directly participating in their crimes. The New Axis also maintains that \u201ca powerful country should be able to impose its will within its declared sphere of influence. The country should even be able to topple a weaker nearby government without the world interfering\u201d \u2014 an idea that the U.S. has always abhorred, as the historical record reveals. Twenty-five hundred years ago, the Delphi Oracle issued a maxim: \u201cKnow Thyself.\u201d Worth remembering, perhaps. As in the case of NSC-68, there is method in the madness. China and Russia do pose real threats. The global hegemon does not take them lightly. There are some striking common features in how U.S. opinion and policy are reacting to the threats. They merit some thought. The Atlantic Council describes the formation of the New Axis as a \u201ctectonic shift in global relations\u201d with plans that are truly \u201chead spinning\u201d: \u201cThe sides agreed to more closely link their economies through cooperation between China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative and Putin\u2019s Eurasian Economic Union. They will work together to develop the Arctic. They\u2019ll deepen coordination in multilateral institutions and to battle climate change.\u201d We should not underestimate the grand significance of the Ukraine crisis, adds Damon Wilson, president of the National Endowment for Democracy. \u201cThe stakes of today\u2019s crisis are not about Ukraine alone, but about the future of freedom,\u201d no less. Strong measures have to be taken right away, says Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell: \u201cPresident Biden should use every tool in his tool box and impose tough sanctions ahead of any invasion and not after it happens.\u201d There is no time to dilly-dally with Macron-style appeals to the raging bear to temper his violence. Received doctrine is that we must confront the formidable threat of China and stand firm on Ukraine, while Europe wavers and Ukraine asks us to tone down the rhetoric and pursue diplomatic measures. Luckily for the world, Washington is unflinching in its dedication to what is right and just, even if it is almost alone, as when it righteously invades Iraq and strangles Cuba in defiance of virtually uniform international protest, to take just two from a plethora of examples. To be fair, adherence to the doctrine is not uniform. There\u2019s deviation, most forcefully on the far right: Tucker Carlson, probably the most influential TV voice. He\u2019s said we shouldn\u2019t be involved in defending Ukraine against Russia \u2014 because we should be devoting all our resources to confronting the far more awesome China threat. Have to get our priorities straight in combating the Axis. Warnings about Russia\u2019s mobilization to invade Ukraine have been an annual media event since the crises of 2014, with regular reports of tens or hundreds of thousands of Russian troops preparing to attack. Today, however, the warnings are far more shrill, with a mixture of fear and ridicule for so-called Mad Vlad, whom theNew York Times\u2019s Thomas Friedman describes as a \u201cone-man psychodrama, with a giant inferiority complex toward America that leaves him always stalking the world with a chip on his shoulder so big it\u2019s amazing he can fit through any door,\u201d or from another perspective, the Russian leader seeking in vain for some response to his repeated requests for some attention to Russia\u2019s expressed concerns. An analysis byMintPressfound that 90 percent of the opinion pieces in the three major national newspapers have adopted a hawkish militant stance, with a bare scattering of questioning \u2014 a familiar phenomenon, as in the days before the Iraq invasion and, in fact, routinely when the state has delivered the word. As in the case of the Sino-Soviet conspiracy to gain \u201cabsolute authority over the rest of the world\u201d in 1950, the word now is that the U.S. must act decisively to counter the threat of the New Axis to the \u201crule-based global order\u201d that is hailed by U.S. commentators, an interesting concept to which I\u2019ll return briefly. The \u201ctectonic shift\u201d is not a myth, and it does pose a threat to the U.S. It threatens U.S. primacy in shaping world order. That\u2019s true of both of the crisis areas, on the borders of Russia and of China. In both cases, negotiated settlements are within reach: regional settlements. If they are achieved, the U.S. will only have an ancillary role, which it may not be willing to accept even at the cost of inflaming extremely hazardous confrontations. In Ukraine, the basic outlines of a settlement are well-known on all sides; we\u2019ve discussed them before. To repeat, the optimal outcome for security of Ukraine (and the world) is the kind of Austrian/Nordic neutrality that prevailed through the Cold War years, offering the opportunity to be part of Western Europe to whatever extent they chose, in every respect apart from providing the U.S. with military bases, which would have been a threat to them as well as to Russia. For internal Ukrainian conflicts, Minsk II provides a general framework. As many analysts observe, Ukraine is not going to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the foreseeable future. George W. Bush rashly issued an invitation to join, but it was immediately vetoed by France and Germany. Though it remains on the table under U.S. pressure, it is not an option. All sides recognize this. The astute and knowledgeable Central Asia scholar Anatol Lieven comments that \u201cthe whole issue of Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership is in fact purely theoretical, so that, in some respects, this whole argument is an argument about nothing \u2014 on both sides, it must be said, Russian as well as the West.\u201d His comment brings to mind [Argentinian writer Jorge Luis] Borges\u2019s description of the Falkland/Malvinas war: two bald men fighting over a comb. Russia pleads security concerns. For the U.S., it is a matter of high principle: We cannot infringe on the sacred right of sovereignty of nations, hence the right to join NATO, which Washington knows is not going to happen. On the Russian side, a formal pledge of non-alignment hardly increases Russian security, any more than Russian security was enhanced when Washington guaranteed to Gorbachev that \u201cnot an inch of NATO\u2019s present military jurisdiction will spread in an eastern direction,\u201d soon abrogated by Clinton, then more radically by W. Bush. Nothing would have changed if the promise had risen from a gentlemen\u2019s agreement to a signed document. The U.S. plea hardly rises to the level of comedy. The U.S. has utter disdain for the principle it proudly proclaims, as recent history once again dramatically confirms. For Washington, there is a deeper issue: A regional settlement would be a serious threat to the U.S. global role. That concern has been simmering right through the Cold War years. Will Europe assume an independent role in world affairs, as it surely can, perhaps along Gaullist lines: Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals, revived in Gorbachev\u2019s 1989 advocacy of a \u201ccommon European home,\u201d a \u201cvast economic space from the Atlantic to the Urals\u201d? Even more unthinkable would be Gorbachev\u2019s broader vision of a Eurasian security system from Lisbon to Vladivostok with no military blocs, shot down without discussion in the negotiations 30 years ago over a post-Cold War settlement. The commitment to maintain the Atlanticist order in Europe, in which the U.S. reigns supreme, has had policy implications that reach beyond Europe itself. One crucial example was Chile in 1973, when the U.S. was working hard to overthrow the parliamentary government, finally succeeding with the installation of the murderous Pinochet dictatorship. A prime reason for destroying democracy in Chile was explained by its prime architect, Henry Kissinger. He warned that parliamentary social reforms in Chile might provide a model for similar efforts in Italy and Spain that might lead Europe on an independent path, away from subordination to U.S. control and the U.S. model of harsher capitalism. The domino theory, often derided, never abandoned, because it is an important instrument of statecraft. The issue arises again with regard to a regional settlement of the Ukraine conflict. Much the same is true in the confrontation with China. As we\u2019ve discussed earlier, there are serious issues concerning China\u2019s violation of international law in the neighboring seas \u2014 though as the one maritime country that refuses even to ratify the UN Law of the Sea, the U.S. is hardly in a strong position to object. Nor does the U.S. alleviate these problems by sending a naval armada through these waters or providing Australia with a fleet of nuclear submarines to enhance the already overwhelming military superiority of the U.S. off the coasts of China. The issues can and should be addressed by the regional powers. As in the case of Ukraine, however, there is a downside: The U.S. will not be in charge. Also as in the case of Ukraine, the U.S. professes its commitment to high principle in taking the lead to confront the threat of China: its horror at China\u2019s human rights abuses, which are doubtless severe. Again, it is easy enough to assess the sincerity of this stand. One revealing index is U.S. military aid. At the top, in a category by themselves, are Israel and Egypt. On the Israeli record on human rights, we can now refer to the detailed reports of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, reviewing the crimes of what they describe as the world\u2019s second apartheid state. Egypt is suffering under the harshest dictatorship of its tortured history. More generally, for many years, there has been a striking correlation between U.S. military aid and torture, massacre, and other severe human rights abuses. There is no more need to tarry on Washington\u2019s concern for human rights than on its dedication to the sacred principle of sovereignty. The fact that these absurdities can even be discussed illustrates how deeply the rhetorical flights of NSC-68 permeate the intellectual culture. Hebrew University lecturer Guy Laron usefully reminds us of another facet of the Ukraine crisis: the long struggle between the U.S. and Russia over control of Europe\u2019s energy, again in the headlines today. Even before Russia was a player, the U.S. sought to shift Europe (and Japan) to an oil-based economy, where the U.S. would have the hand on the spigot. Much of Marshall Plan aid was directed to this end. From George Kennan to Zbigniew Brzezinski commenting on the invasion of Iraq (which he opposed, but felt might confer advantages to the U.S. with the anticipated control over major oil resources), planners have recognized that control over energy resources could provide \u201ccritical leverage\u201d over allies. Later years saw many struggles in the Cold War framework Laron describes, now very prominent. Ukraine has had a large part in these confrontations. Throughout, the shape of world order has of course been a driving concern of policy makers. For post-World War II Washington, there is only one acceptable form: under its leadership. And it must be a particular form of world order: the \u201crule-based international order,\u201d which has displaced an earlier commitment to the \u201cUN-based international order\u201d established under U.S. lead after World War II. It\u2019s not hard to discern the reasons for the transition in policy and accompanying commentary. In the rule-based order, the U.S. sets the rules. The same was true in the UN-based order in the early years after World War II. U.S. global dominance was so overwhelming that the UN served virtually as a tool of U.S. foreign policy and a weapon against its enemies. Not surprisingly, the UN was highly regarded in U.S. popular and intellectual culture, along with the UN-based international order, guided by Washington. That turned out to be a passing phase. The UN began to fall out of favor in U.S. elite opinion as it lurched out of control with the recovery of other industrial societies but particularly with decolonization, which brought discordant voices into the UN and also in independent structures such as the Non-Aligned Movement and many others \u2014 all very vocal and active, though effectively barred from the international information order dominated by the traditional imperial societies. Within the UN there were calls for a \u201cNew International Economic Order\u201d that would offer the Global South something better than a continuation of the large-scale robbery, violent intervention and subversion that the colonized world had enjoyed during the long reign of Western imperialism. There were other threats, such as a call for a New International Information Order that would provide some opportunity for voices of the former colonies to enter the international information system, a near monopoly of the imperial powers. The masters of the world undertook vigorous campaigns to beat back these efforts, a major though largely ignored chapter of modern history \u2014 though not completely; there is some fine work of exposure and analysis. One effect of the Global South\u2019s disruptive efforts was to turn U.S. practice and elite opinion against the UN, no longer a reliable agency of U.S. power as it had been in the early Cold War years. Furthermore, the foundations of modern international law in the few UN treaties that the U.S. ratified became completely unacceptable as the years passed, particularly the banning of \u201cthe threat or use of force\u201d in international affairs, a practice in which the U.S. is far in the lead. It is conventional to say that the U.S. and Russia engaged in proxy wars during the Cold War years \u2014 omitting the fact that with rare exceptions, these were conflicts in which Russia provided some support to victims of U.S. attack. All topics that should have far more prominence. In this context, the \u201crule-based international order\u201d became the favored pillar of world order, and there is much annoyance when China calls instead for the UN-based international order as it did at the rancorous March 2021 China-U.S. summit in Alaska (putting aside the sincerity of these pronouncements). It\u2019s intriguing to see how the conflict with China plays out in U.S. policy and discourse in other domains. A front-page story inThe New York Timesis headlined: \u201cHouse Passes Bill Adding Billions to Research to Compete With China; The vote sets up a fight with the Senate, which has different recommendations for how the United States should bolster its technology industry to take on China.\u201d The official name of the bill is \u201cThe America Competes Act of 2022\u201d \u2014 meaning \u201ccompete\u201d with China. The passage of the bill was hailed in the left-liberal press: \u201cThe House gave President Joe Biden another reason to celebrate on Friday with the passage of a bill aimed at boosting competitiveness with China.\u201d"

There is no denying that China is a rising superpower confronting the U.S. Reporting a study of Harvard\u2019s Belfer Center of International Affairs, Graham Allison argued further that the so-called Thucydides Trap is likely to lead to a U.S.-China war. That cannot happen. U.S.-China war means simply: game over. There are critical global issues on which the U.S. and China must cooperate. They will either work together, or collapse together, bringing the world down with them."

    "input": "One of the most striking developments in the international arena today is that while the U.S. is pulling back from the Mideast, and elsewhere, China is moving in but with a different strategic approach and overall agenda. Instead of bombs, missiles and coercive diplomacy, China is expanding its influence with the use of \u201csoft power.\u201d Indeed, U.S. overseas expansion was always overwhelmingly dependent on the use of hard power, and, as result, it would only leave black holes behind after its withdrawal. To what extent, as some might argue, is this the result of a young nation ignorant of history and with lack of experience in global affairs (although it would be hard to find any examples of benign imperialism)?",
    "output": "I don\u2019t think the U.S. has forged new paths in Western imperial brutality. Simply consider its immediate predecessors in world control. British wealth and global power derived from piracy (such heroic figures as Sir Francis Drake), despoiling India by guile and violence, hideous slavery, the world\u2019s greatest narcotrafficking enterprise, and other such gracious acts. France was no different. Belgium broke records in hideous crimes. Today\u2019s China is hardly benign within its much more limited reach. Exceptions would be hard to find. The two cases you mention have highly instructive features, brought out clearly, if unintentionally, by how they are depicted. Take an article inThe New York Timesabout the growing China threat. The headline reads: \u201cAs the U.S. Pulls Back from the Mideast, China Leans in; expanding its ties to Middle Eastern states with vast infrastructure investments and cooperation on technology and security.\u201d That\u2019s accurate; it\u2019s one example of what\u2019s happening all over the world. The U.S. is withdrawing military forces that have battered the Mideast region for decades in traditional imperial style. The evil Chinese are exploiting the retreat by expanding China\u2019s influence with investment, loans, technology, development programs. What\u2019s called \u201csoft power.\u201d Not just in the Mideast. The most extensive Chinese project is the huge Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that is taking shape within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which incorporates the Central Asia states, India, Pakistan, Russia, now Iran, reaching to Turkey and with its eye on Central Europe. It may well include Afghanistan if it can survive its current catastrophe. Chinese aid and development might manage to shift the Afghan economy from heroin production for Europe, the core of the economy during the U.S. occupation, to exploitation of its rich mineral resources. The BRI has offshoots in the Middle East, including Israel. There are accompanying programs in Africa, and now even Latin America, over strenuous U.S. objections. Recently, China announced that it\u2019s taking over the manufacturing facilities in S\u00e3o Paulo that Ford abandoned, and will initiate large-scale electric vehicles production, an area in which China is far ahead. The U.S. has no way to counter these efforts. Bombs, missiles, special forces raids in rural communities just don\u2019t work. It\u2019s an old dilemma. Sixty years ago in Vietnam, U.S. counterinsurgency efforts were stymied by a problem that was despairingly recognized by U.S. intelligence and by Province Advisers: the Vietnamese resistance \u2014 the Viet Cong (VC), in U.S. discourse \u2014 were fighting a political war, a domain in which the U.S. was weak. The U.S. was responding with a military war, the arena in which it is strong. But that couldn\u2019t overcome the appeal of VC programs to the peasant population. The only way the Kennedy administration could react to the VC political war was by U.S. Air Force bombing of rural areas, authorizing napalm, large-scale crop and livestock destruction and other programs to drive the peasants to virtual concentration camps where they could be \u201cprotected\u201d from the guerillas who the U.S. knew they were supporting. The consequences we know. Earlier, the dilemma had been explained by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, addressing the National Security Council about U.S. problems with Brazil, where elites, he said, are \u201clike children, with no capacity for self-government.\u201d Worse still, in his words, the U.S. is \u201chopelessly far behind the Soviets in developing controls over the minds and emotions of unsophisticated peoples\u201d of the Global South, even educated elites. Dulles lamented to the president about the Communist \u201cability to get control of mass movements, ... something we have no capacity to duplicate. The poor people are the ones they appeal to and they have always wanted to plunder the rich.\u201d Dulles left unsaid the obvious: The poor people somehow don\u2019t respond well to our appeal of the rich to plunder the poor, so with great reluctance we have to turn to the arena of violence, where we dominate. That\u2019s not unlike the dilemma posed when China \u201cleans in\u201d to the Global South by \u201cexpanding its ties with vast infrastructure investments and cooperation on technology and security.\u201d That is one central element of the China threat that is eliciting such fears and anguish. The U.S. is reacting to this growing China threat in the arena where it is strong. The U.S. of course has overwhelming military dominance worldwide, even right off the coast of China. But it\u2019s being enhanced. Last December, military analyst Michael Klare reports, President Biden signed the National Defense Authorization Act. It calls for \u201can unbroken chain of U.S.-armed sentinel states \u2014 stretching from Japan and South Korea in the northern Pacific to Australia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore in the south and India on China\u2019s eastern flank\u201d \u2014 meant to encircle China. Klare adds that, \u201cOminously enough Taiwan too is included in the chain of armed sentinel states.\u201d The word \u201cominously\u201d is well chosen. China of course regards Taiwan as part of China. So does the U.S., formally. The official U.S. one-China policy recognizes Taiwan as part of China, with a tacit agreement that no steps will be taken to forcefully change its status. Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo chipped away at this formula. It\u2019s now being driven to the brink. China has the choice of either succumbing or resisting. It is not going to succumb. This is only one component of the program to defend the U.S. from the China threat. A complementary element is to undermine China\u2019s economy by means too well-known to review. In particular [in the U.S.\u2019s eyes], China must be prevented from advancing in the technology of the future \u2014 actually extending its lead in some areas, such as electrification and renewable energy, the technologies that might save us from our race to destroy the environment that sustains life. One aspect of these efforts to undermine China\u2019s progress is to pressure other countries to reject superior Chinese technology. China has found a way to get around these efforts. They are planning to establish technical schools in countries of the Global South to teach advanced technology \u2014 Chinese technology, which graduates will then use. Again, the kind of aggression that is hard to confront."

In this context, could it be argued that the U.S. empire is weakening in the 21st century, and that the end of the U.S. empire might not be a peaceful event?",
    "output": "It has been widely predicted in foreign policy circles for many years that China is poised to surpass the U.S. and to dominate world affairs, a dubious prospect, in my opinion, unless the U.S. continues on its current course of self-destruction, probably to be accelerated with the predicted congressional victory of the denialist party in November. As we have discussed before, for some years the former Republican Party has been more accurately described as a \u201cradical insurgency\u201d that has abandoned normal parliamentary politics, to borrow the terms of political analysts Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute a decade ago \u2014 when Trump\u2019s takeover of the insurgency was not yet a nightmare. The Trump administration established a two-war doctrine in all but name. A war between two nuclear powers can quickly get out of control, meaning the end. step towards utter irrationality was taken last December 27, perhaps in celebration of Christmas, when President Biden signed the National Defense Authorization Act, discussed earlier, enhancing the policy of \u201cencirclement\u201d of China, \u201ccontainment\u201d being out of date. That includes formation of the Quad: U.S.-India-Japan-Australia, supplementing the AUKUS alliance (Australia, U.K., U.S.) and the Anglosphere\u2019s Five Eyes, all of them strategic-military alliances confronting China. China has only a troubled hinterland. As discussed earlier, the radical military imbalance in favor of the U.S. is being enhanced by other provocative acts, carrying great risk. Apparently we cannot let down our guard with the Axis powers on the march once again. It\u2019s all too easy to sketch a likely trajectory that is far from a pleasant prospect. But we should never forget the usual proviso. We do not have to be passive spectators, thereby contributing to potential disaster."

If the U.S. also reject them, which is very possible, one conceivable outcome is that the U.S. would just withdraw, and the rest of the P5+1 will maintain some kind of relationship with Iran. They don\u2019t want to break their relationship with the U.S. either. So, they are in a very difficult situation. They don\u2019t want to abandon Iran and on the other hand, they are very frightened about the U.S. for good reason.

A lot of them are evangelical Christians. The secular state doesn\u2019t mean anything to them. They are working for Jesus, and Jesus says support Trump.

That\u2019s why he is doing one crazy thing after another. It\u2019s not what it looks like. The media criticizes Trump, which fires up his base, because they regard themselves as under attack by the liberal media. So, he plays that game. Underneath, the real villains Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are busy dismantling every aspect of the government that might be of benefit to the general population. They are serving their real constituency, the rich and the corporate sector, with abject dedication to sheer robbery. The tax bill was a massive gift to the super rich, with a few pennies to the others just to keep them quiet. Ryan and McConnell want to have a huge deficit so that gives the pretext to dismantling social security, Medicaid, Medicare, and food stamps\u2014anything that benefits the general population. In the meantime, keep the base fired up with white nationalism, racism, religious extremism, and so on. It is a very dangerous situation. Also, as you probably saw around the country, it is a very violent country. There are heavily armed militias all over the place. They are better armed than the state police.

There were negotiations, between George Bush, the first; James Baker, secretary of state; Mikhail Gorbachev; Genscher and Kohl, the Germans, on how to deal with the\u2014this was after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the beginning of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev made an astonishing concession. Astonishing. He agreed to allow Germany, now unified, to join NATO\u2014a hostile military alliance. Just look at the history of the preceding years. Germany alone had practically destroyed Russia, at an extraordinary cost, several times during the preceding century. But he agreed to allow Germany to\u2014a rearmed Germany to joinNATO, a military alliance that was set up to counter Russia. There was aquid pro quo, namely thatNATOnot\u2014meaningNATOmeans basically U.S. forces\u2014not expand to East Berlin, to East Germany. Nobody talked about anything beyond that. Baker and Bush verbally agreed to that. They didn\u2019t put it in writing, but they essentially said, \u201cYeah, we will\u201d\u2014in fact, the phrase that was used was \u201cnot one inch to the east.\u201d Well, what happened?NATOimmediately moved to East Germany. Under Clinton, other countries, former Russian satellites, were introduced intoNATO. Finally,NATOwent so far, as I mentioned before, 2008, again in 2013, to suggest that even Ukraine, right at the heartland of Russian strategic concerns\u2014any Russian president, no matter who it was, any Russian leader\u2014that they joinNATO. So, what\u2019sNATOdoing altogether? Well, actually, its mission was changed. The official mission ofNATOwas changed to become to be\u2014to control and safeguard the global energy system, sea lanes, pipelines and so on. And, of course, on the side, it\u2019s acting as a intervention force for the United States. Is that a legitimate reason for us to maintainNATO, to be an instrument for U.S. global domination? I think that\u2019s a rather serious question. That\u2019s not the question that\u2019s asked. The question that\u2019s asked is whetherNATOmade\u2014whether Trump made some demeaning comment about Montenegro. It\u2019s another example of what I was talking about before: the focus of the media and the political class, and the intellectual community in general, on marginalia, overlooking critical and crucial issues, issues which do literally have to do with human survival.

How do we reach them?",
    "output": "NOAM CHOMSKY: That\u2019s serious. That is a very interesting phenomenon; it has to be dealt with sensitively and with understanding. As I mentioned, 40% of the population say it can\u2019t be a problem because of the Second Coming. Now that\u2019s a deep cultural problem in the United States. People who know something about US history should all... we should all understand it. It\u2019s very important to realize that this country was a cultural backwater until World War II. [Until then,] if you wanted to study physics, you went to Germany. You wanted to become a writer, an artist, you went to Paris. There were exceptions of course but it was overwhelmingly true, and it was true even though the United States was far and away the richest, most powerful country in the world and had been for a long time. [There are] all kinds of historical reasons for that: it\u2019s a very insular country. There aren\u2019t many countries where you can travel 3,000 miles and be in about the same place where you left, not running into any different culture or language or anything like that. Protected by oceans, we keep away from those bad guys, enormous internal resources which nobody else had. There were a lot of waves of immigrants that became integrated and so on, so there are a lot of reasons for it, but it\u2019s there and you can\u2019t ignore it. You can\u2019t ignore it, and there is no point railing about atheism. These are issues that have to be understood, and it has to be understood that the churches really mean something to people, plenty of people, including the Trump supporters. These are people who have just been cast aside, nobody does anything for them. The Democrats abandoned the working class decades ago. Republicans may take a populist line, but they are much more opposed to working people than even the Democrats in policies. Working-class males are \u2014 we are supposed to call them \u201cmiddle class\u201d in the United States, the phrase \u201cworking class\u201d is a four-letter word here \u2014 but working-class males who are supporting Trump are actually supporting policies which are going to devastate them. Just take a look at the economic policies, the fiscal policies and others. But it\u2019s true that they are cast aside, and their values are being attacked. Their values are in many ways culturally traditional and pre-modern in the Western sense, but they are being attacked. One of the few refuges they have is the church. They are the church in a traditional community so you can\u2019t just laugh at it, it\u2019s serious. It has to be dealt with. There is a very interesting book that just came out by Arlie Hochschild, a sociologist, who went to a pretty terribly impoverished area in Louisiana and lived there for six years and studied the people sympathetically. This is deep Trump country, and her results are quite interesting. For example, these are people who are being devastated by chemical and other pollution from the petrochemical industry, but they are strongly opposed to the Environmental Protection Agency. When she asks why, they have reasons. They say, \u201cLook, what is the Environmental Protection Agency? It\u2019s some guy from the city with a Ph.D. who comes out here and tells me I can\u2019t fish but he doesn\u2019t go after the petrochemical industries. So, who wants them? I don\u2019t want them taking away my job and telling me what I can do and speaking to me with the cultivated accents meanwhile I\u2019m under attack by all this stuff.\u201d These attitudes are serious. They are significant. They deserve respect and not ridicule, and I think they can be addressed. For example, I think that say in the 1930s, I\u2019m old enough to remember, in many ways, it was kind of like now; poverty was much greater. The depression was much worse than the current recession. In fact, it was a much poorer country than it is now. I was very hopeful. My own family, many of them were unemployed working class; most workers were unemployed, but they were hopeful. They had a sense that things are going to get better. There were labor actions, the CIO\u2019s organizing, there were left political parties, the unions were providing real services: a couple of weeks in the country, educational groups, workers education, ways for people to get together \u2013 somehow we\u2019ll get out of all this. That\u2019s lacking. It has become a very atomized society. People are alone in it: used to be their TV sets, now it\u2019s their cell phones or iPhones or whatever. They\u2019re very atomized, isolated, makes them feel very vulnerable. These are the kind of things that can be overcome by organization and activism. My own feeling [is] that the Trump supporters and the Sanders supporters could have been a unified bloc. Proper approaches to the problem take effort, sensitivity, and understanding of the kind for example that Hochschild showed with her sympathetic account of where these people are coming from and why. It\u2019s easy, say in the New Yorker, to have a cartoon about Trump and how ridiculous it is, but that\u2019s missing the point. Maybe it looks ridiculous, but he is reaching people for reasons and we should be interested in the reasons. Actually, it\u2019s the same story, to turn to something else, with young Muslims in the West who are joining the jihad movements. It\u2019s not enough to scream at them; there are reasons. If you look at the circumstances in their lives, you can see the reasons and they can be addressed."

For example, a couple of years ago, I happened to be asked to give a talk at a high school in Boston, it\u2019s called English High School, and the reason is because nobody there speaks English [as a first language]. There are maybe a dozen languages with different immigrant groups. It\u2019s a very activist community. There are local activists who are discussing the kind of work that they do there, and it\u2019s important and interesting right here in Boston. People feel that it\u2019s hopeless, we can\u2019t do anything. How can we fight these big powers? Some of the things that were described I think were very instructive for me; I think they would [be] for all of us. For example, get together a group of mothers who want to have a traffic light at a street where their kids have to cross when they go to school. They organize leaflets, talk to each other, talk to the local representatives and other things. Finally, they get their traffic light and that\u2019s empowering. That tells you that you can do something. We are not alone. We can do other things and then you go on from there; that\u2019s how things develop. Yeah, Louisiana, but not far from home either, and there\u2019s plenty [to do] incidentally \u2013 right in our own \u201ceducated\u201d communities.

Almost everything I talked about tonight, for example, I doubt if a tiny fraction of well-educated academics who work in these areas would even know about it \u2013 that\u2019s right, exactly where we live."

I spoke about this flash point in history with Noam Chomsky, known as the father of modern linguistics, who is one of the world\u2019s most prominent public intellectuals and the author of over 100 books, includingHegemony or Survival,Failed States,Optimism Over Despair,Hopes and Prospects,Masters of MankindandWho Rules the World?",
    "output": "In the following interview, Chomsky provides insight on how we can best grapple with the current moment \u2013 and prepare for the sobering future. George Yancy: Before I ask you about COVID-19, I\u2019d like to start by asking your thoughts on the horrible murder of George Floyd and how you understand the protests that have occurred throughout the U.S. and the world. I am especially interested in your response to Trump\u2019s rhetoric to deploy the military to suppress a so-called insurrection. \u201cHorrible murder\u201d is right. But let us be clear about the murders of Black Americans going on right now. The brutality of a few racist policemen in Minneapolis constitutes a small part of the crime. It has been widely noted that death rates from the pandemic are far higher among Black people. A current study found that \u201cAmericans living in counties with above-average black populations are three times as likely to die of the coronavirus as those in above-average white counties. This slaughter of Black people is partly a result of how resources were devoted to dealing with the crisis, mostly \u201cin areas that happened to be whiter and more affluent.\u201d But it is rooted more deeply in a hideous record of 400 years of malevolent racism. The plague has been taking different forms since the establishment of the most vicious system of slavery in human history \u2014 a prime foundation of the country\u2019s industry, finance, commerce and general prosperity \u2014 but has at most been mitigated, never brought close to a cure. American slavery was unique not only in terms of its viciousness, but also in that it was linked to skin color. Within this system, every Black face was marked with the emblem, \u201cYour nature is to be a slave.\u201d Other sectors have been harshly treated. Jews and Italians were so feared and despised a century ago that the 1924 racist immigration law was designed to bar them from the country, sending many Jews to crematoria. In support, racists of the day could plead that we had to protect ourselves from the Jews and Italians running the major criminal syndicates, from creatures like Meyer Lansky and Al Capone and Bugsy Siegel. But they were finally assimilated. The same happened with the Irish. With Black people, however, it is different. They are deemed permanently unassimilable in a society cursed by racism and white supremacy. For the victims, the effects are compounded by the lasting socioeconomic gaps engendered by the curse, intensified by the neoliberal assault of the past 40 years, a great boon to extreme wealth, a disaster for the more vulnerable. The slaughter of Black Americans proceeds under the radar. The president, whose malice knows no bound, has been exploiting the focus on the pandemic to pursue his service to his prime constituency, great wealth and corporate power. One method is eliminating regulations that protect the public but harm profits. In the midst of an unprecedented respiratory pandemic, Trump has moved to increase air pollution, which makes COVID-19 far more deadly, so much so that tens of thousands of Americans may die as a result, the business press reports. As usual, deaths are not randomly distributed: \u201cHardest hit are low-income communities and people of color,\u201d who are forced to live in the most dangerous areas. It is all too easy to continue. The protesters know all of this very well. They need no studies. For many it is their lived experience. The protests are not just calling for an end to police brutality in Black communities, but for much more fundamental restructuring of social and economic institutions. And they are receiving remarkable support, as we see not only from actions all over the country but also from polls. An early June poll \u201cfound 64 percent of American adults were \u2018sympathetic to people who are out protesting right now,\u2019 while 27 percent said they were not and 9 percent were unsure.\u201d We may compare this reaction to another occasion when similar protests occurred: 1992, after the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers who beat Rodney King almost to death. A week of riots followed, with over 60 deaths, finally quelled by the National Guard backed by federal troops sent by President Bush. The protests were mostly limited to Los Angeles, nothing like what we are seeing today. Trump has one overriding concern, his own welfare:How can I use this tragedy to enhance my electoral prospects by firing up the most racist and violent components of my voting base?His natural instincts call for violence: \u201cthe most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.\u201d And send in the military to teach the \u201cscum\u201d a lesson they\u2019ll never forget. Trump\u2019s plan to \u201cdominate\u201d the errant population by violence elicited widespread anger, including bitter condemnation by former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff along with expressions of sympathy for the protestors. Former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Admiral Mike Mullen wrote: \u201cAs a white man, I cannot claim perfect understanding of the fear and anger that African Americans feel today.... But as someone who has been around for a while, I know enough \u2014 and I\u2019ve seen enough \u2014 to understand that those feelings are real and that they are all too painfully founded.\u201d The changes in the past two decades are perhaps a sign that large parts of the population are coming to recognize long-concealed truths about our society, a ray of light in dark times."

We are fed on a diet of \u201cAmerican exceptionalism.\u201d Yet, globally, we have the highest number of deaths due to COVID-19. We were systemically unprepared. How do you explain this incongruity, and what role does Trump play in all of this?",
    "output": "The lack of preparedness has three basic causes: capitalist logic, neoliberal doctrine, and the character of the political leadership. Let\u2019s run through them briefly in turn. After the 2003 SARS epidemic was contained, scientists were well aware that a pandemic was likely and that it might be caused by another coronavirus. They also knew how to take measures to prepare. But knowledge is not enough. Someone must use it. The obvious candidate is the drug companies, which have all the resources needed and huge profits, thanks in no small measure to the exorbitant patents granted them in the mislabeled \u201cfree trade\u201d agreements. But they were blocked by capitalist logic. There\u2019s no profit in preparing for a possible catastrophe down the road \u2014 and as economist Milton Friedman intoned at the dawn of the neoliberal age 40 years ago, the sole responsibility of the corporation is to maximize shareholder value (and management wealth). As recently as 2017, the major drug companies rejected a European Union proposal to fast-track research on pathogens, including coronavirus. The other candidate is the government, which also has the necessary resources and has played a significant role in developing most vaccines and drugs. But that path is blocked by the neoliberal doctrine that has prevailed since Reagan, who informed us that government is the problem \u2014 meaning that decisions must be removed from the government, which is to some extent influenced by citizens, to the unaccountable private tyrannies that were the primary agents (and beneficiaries) of the neoliberal triumph. So, government is barred as well. The third factor is individual governments. Keeping to the U.S., President George H.W. Bush had established a [President\u2019s] Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) to keep the president abreast of important scientific issues. One of President Obama\u2019s first acts on taking office in 2009 was to commission a PCAST study on how to deal with a pandemic. It was provided to the White House a few weeks later. The science-oriented Obama administration proceeded to put in place a pandemic infrastructure which planned early response to infectious disease threats. That was in place until Jan. 20, 2017, when President Trump took office, and within days began to dismantle the entire executive branch science infrastructure, including the preparations for pandemic, and indeed moved on to reject science generally from a role in informing policy, reversing the bipartisan initiatives since World War II that have been critical for developing the modern high-tech economy. To drive further nails into the coffin, Trump disbanded programs in which scientists worked with Chinese colleagues to investigate coronaviruses. Each year, he defunded the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That continued with his budget proposal of February 2020 while the pandemic was raging, calling for further CDC cuts (while raising subsidies to fossil fuel industries). Scientists were systematically replaced by industry officials who would ensure that private profit is maximized whatever the impact on the irrelevant public. Trump\u2019s decisions accord with the judgment of his favorite pundit, Rush Limbaugh, to whom he awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He instructs us that science is one of the \u201cfour corners of deceit,\u201d along with academia, media and government, all of which \u201cexist by virtue of deceit.\u201d The guiding maxim of the administration was articulated more eloquently by Franco\u2019s leading general in 1936: \u201cDown with intelligence! Viva death!\u201d As a result, the U.S. was \u201csystematically unprepared\u201d when the pandemic hit."

His malevolence persisted after the disease struck. A few weeks after discovery of the first symptoms last December, Chinese scientists identified the virus, sequenced the genome, and provided the information to the WHO and the world. Countries in Asia and Oceania reacted at once, and have the situation largely under control. Others varied. Trump brought up the rear. For two crucial months, U.S. intelligence and health officials tried to capture the attention of the White House, in vain. Finally, Trump noticed \u2014 possibly when the stock market crashed, it has been reported. Since then it has been chaos. Not surprisingly, Trump and his minions have been thrashing around desperately to find some scapegoat to blame for his crimes against Americans, oblivious to how many more people he slaughters. Defunding and then pulling out of the WHO [World Health Organization] is a sadistic blow against Africans, Yemenis, and many other poor and desperate people who had been protected from rampant diseases by WHO medical aid even before the coronavirus struck, and are now facing new catastrophes in addition. They are dispensable if it will improve his electoral prospects. Trump\u2019s charge against the WHO, which is too ludicrous to discuss, is that it was being controlled by China. By pulling out, he increases Chinese influence. But it is unfair to criticize him for foolishness. The outcome only underscores the fact that he never cared about this in the first place."

    "output": "Republicans overwhelmingly have faith in the president, no matter how much his actions harm them. His god-like image is amplified by those who surround him, thanks to his successful campaign to get rid of everyone but fawning sycophants, like the second-in-command, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who muses that God may have sent Trump to earth to save Israel from Iran. Pompeo\u2019s fellow evangelicals, the largest base of Trump supporters, likely agree. And they hear much the same generally from the Republican Party, which has virtually abandoned any shred of integrity and abjectly worship him whatever he does. Much the same is true of his media echo chamber. Studies have shown that the primary source of information for Republicans isFox News, Limbaugh andBreitbart. In fact, an interesting dyad has developed: Trump issues some random pronouncement, it is hailed by Sean Hannity as a path-breaking discovery, and the next morning Trump turns toFox Newsto find out what to think. Surveys of public opinion reveal the consequences. A Pew poll in April, when Trump\u2019s responsibility for the growing disaster was beyond serious debate, found that 83 percent of Republicans and Republican leaners rated Trump\u2019s response to the outbreak as either excellent or good (as compared with 18 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners). They are listening to a president who had been comparing the virus to \u201cregular flu,\u201d and who in mid-April tweeted instructions to his supporters to \u201cLIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!\u201d The 2nd Amendment has not the slightest relevance, but Trump knows what buttons to push. He was, transparently, urging his troops to take up arms, part of his more general attempts to encourage armed protestors to violate orders in states with Democratic governors (like Virginia), at a time when there were almost 50,000 recorded deaths. Let\u2019s kill more Americans, not just Yemenis and Africans, if it will improve my electoral prospects. \u201cDown with intelligence! Viva death!\u201d When we exclude the Astroturf operations and the fervent loyalty of the voting base, it\u2019s not clear that much is left of an appeal to \u201cindividual rights\u201d in any meaningful sense. Nor is it clear that the protestors are overriding social responsibility. They evidently don\u2019t see it that way. They would be appalled at the idea that what they are doing is similar to people with assault rifles running around the streets shooting randomly, though the comparison is apt. They do not think they are endangering anyone. Rather, they are following their revered leader in protesting an effort by the radical left, maybe on instructions from China, to destroy their elementary rights and even to take away their guns. All further signs that the country is in deep trouble \u2014 and in the light of U.S. power, the world with it."

He\u2019s quite competent in pursuing his primary goals: enriching the very wealthy, enhancing corporate power and profit, keeping his base in line while he stabs them in the back, and concentrating power in his hands by dismantling the executive branch, and so intimidating congressional Republicans that they timidly accept almost anything. I didn\u2019t hear a peep from them when Trump fired the scientist in charge of vaccine development for daring to question one of the quack cures he is promoting. There is dead silence from these ranks as he carries out his purge of inspector generals, who impose some controls on the swamp he has created in Washington, also insulting one of the most respected Republican senators, 86-year-old Chuck Grassley, who devoted his long career to establishing this system. It is an impressive achievement. What has to be done globally is to follow the advice that scientists are providing. A new pandemic is likely, probably worse than this one because of global warming, which may become climate roasting with another four years of the Trump plague. Steps have to be taken to prepare for it, the kind that were recommended in 2003 and were in small part pursued until Trump wielded his wrecking ball. There should be international cooperation in seeking coronaviruses and other potential hazards, developing the scientific understanding needed for rapid development of vaccines and drugs to alleviate symptoms, and implementing contingency plans to be put in place if a pandemic strikes again. For the U.S. in particular, that means extricating the society from neoliberal dogma, which has had bitter consequences in the domain of health (and many others). The business model for hospitals, with no waste or spare capacity, is an invitation to disaster. More generally, the highly inefficient privatized health care system is a terrible burden on the society, with double the costs of other developed countries and some of the poorest outcomes. A recentLancetstudy estimates its annual cost at almost $500 billion and 68,000 extra deaths. It is outrageous that the U.S. cannot rise to the level of other societies and instead relies on the most cruel and costly system of universal health care: emergency rooms. If you can drag yourself to one you can get care \u2014 followed perhaps by a healthy bill. The same neoliberal dogma prevents the National Institutes of Health from proceeding beyond essential research and development for drugs to testing and distribution, bypassing the private companies and implementing the provisions of U.S. law, constantly ignored, which require that drugs produced with government assistance (virtually all) be available to the public at reasonable cost. The most careful studies of these matters that I know of are by Dean Baker, who estimates enormous savings with no loss of innovation if such measures are introduced (see his bookRigged, available free). This is only a bare beginning. There are deep social, cultural and institutional problems that should be addressed."

Loss of the current opportunity might doom their project. For Trump personally, the prospects of loss may be severe, even if he is psychologically capable of accepting it like a normal human being. He may be vulnerable to serious legal charges if his immunity is lost. And with the Republican Party having surrendered to his authority, North Korean-style, he faces few impediments. We can leave the rest to the imagination."

They are working relentlessly to ensure that what emerges is a harsher and more authoritarian version of what they had created in their own interest. There are popular forces seeking to grasp the current opportunities to reverse the disasters of the recent past and to move forward to a far more humane and decent world. And, crucially, to confront the far more severe crises that are looming. We will recover from the pandemic, at a terrible cost. We will not recover from the ongoing melting of the polar ice sheets and the other consequences of the roasting of the earth that will make many of the areas of human habitation unlivable before too long if we continue on our current course.

These developments can only be countered by progressive social movements that offer credible answers to the often bitter exigencies of daily life and, even better, point the way to needed social and institutional change.

That\u2019s fortunate because in the real world conditions are not ripe for large scale institutional change to true democratization and popular participatory control of social, economic, and political life \u2013 though in fact seeds of such developments do exist and can flourish. Like it or not, the urgent issues of today will have to be confronted within the general framework of existing institutions, while at the same time serious efforts should be undertaken to rid ourselves of oppressive institutions and move forward to greater freedom, justice, authentic democracy, cooperation and mutual aid in all spheres of life."

Why is life expectancy continuing to decline in the US for the first time since World War I and the flu pandemic? Why is this particularly salient among working-class whites \u2013 who have been cast aside by the neoliberal policies of the past generation, including the particular form of globalization that has been designed in the interests of the investor class and transnational capital?",
    "output": "The move from opiate abuse to the regressive policies that began to take shape in the late \u201970s, accelerated by Reagan and his successors, is fairly straightforward. And as I mentioned earlier, there are counterparts elsewhere, in the rise of \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d and the collapse of the centrist forces that have dominated political life since World War II. Studies ranging from the US to Sweden and others have found that xenophobia, anti-immigrant hysteria, racism, and the rise of the ultranationalist right in general have tended to follow economic distress and reversal of social democratic programs. So, yes, the world is a complex place and a multitude of factors interact, but there are some systematic features in global malaise \u2013 which point the way to corrective action."

    "output": "NOAM: The main point to keep in mind is that proposals of this nature must succeed. Must, or else we are doomed. Some of the proposals are quite carefully designed, and developed in a form that can be used as a basis for organizing, notably Pollin\u2019s work on a Green New Deal. There is of course ample reason to expect corporate resistance, both from the evidence of history and the nature of state-capitalist markets. But it seems that we have passed beyond the days when, for example, ExxonMobil executives reacted to James Hansen\u2019s publicizing the threat of global warming in 1988 by devoting resources to engendering skepticism or outright denialism \u2013 knowing exactly what they were doing, since their own scientists had long been among the leaders in demonstrating the extreme gravity of the threats. By now the threats are so evident that we seem to have moved to an era marked more by co-optation and mitigation rather than by outright rejection of reality. That\u2019s often happened in the past: the practices of the lethal tobacco industries, for example. The shift offers opportunities for activists, but they are littered with pitfalls that have to be recognized and avoided. Strategies should be designed to grasp the opportunities \u2013 to fail to do so is counterproductive \u2013 but with due attention to the motives, intentions, and manipulations of the systems of power.

    "input": "Let\u2019s talk now specifically about some of Bolsonaro\u2019s policies, which have been denounced by activists, economists and organizations such as Human Rights Watch, as well as by Indigenous leaders. And how would you compare his policies to those of Donald Trump?",
    "output": "The analogy is apt. Trump was Bolsonaro\u2019s unconcealed model, though not the only one. In casting his vote to impeach Dilma, he dedicated it to her torturer during the military dictatorship. That\u2019s a level of depravity that even his hero Trump didn\u2019t reach. His admiration for the dictatorship is also unconcealed, though he does have some criticisms of the military. His prime complaint is that they were too mild. They should have killed 30,000 people as the military did in Argentina next door. He has also criticized the behavior of the military in earlier years. They should have imitated the U.S. cavalry, which virtually eliminated the Native population. Instead, the Brazilian military left remnants in the Amazon. But Bolsonaro has made it quite clear that he intends to overcome that problem. Like Trump, Bolsonaro\u2019s most important policy commitments, by far, are to destroy the prospects for organized human life in the interest of short-term profits for his friends \u2014 in his case, mining, agribusiness and illegal logging that have sharply accelerated the destruction of the Amazon forests. Scientists had anticipated, pre-Bolsonaro, that in a few decades, the Amazon would shift from one of the world\u2019s greatest carbon sinks to a carbon source, as it transitions from tropical forest to savannah. Thanks to Bolsonaro, that point may already be approaching. For Brazil, the effects will be devastating. Rainfall will sharply decline, with much of the rich agricultural land turning to desert. The world as a whole will suffer a severe blow, a wound that might prove to be lethal. For the Indigenous inhabitants of the forest, the outcome is genocidal. As elsewhere in the world, the Indigenous in Brazil have been in the forefront for years in trying to protect human society from the depredations of \u201cadvanced civilization.\u201d But time is growing short, and if the Trumps and Bolsonaros of the world are granted free rein, chances of decent survival are slim. Again, as in the case of Trump, Bolsonaro\u2019s malevolence is not exhausted by his commitment to destroy organized human society \u2014 along with the innumerable species that we are quickly driving to extinction. Like Trump, he can claim personal responsibility for tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of COVID deaths, to mention one salient contribution to the welfare of his country. Police killings, overwhelmingly with Black victims, have long been a plague, mounting under Bolsonaro. A particularly shocking recent incident of military assault on a Rio favela reached international headlines. All too easy to continue."

    "input": "Brazilians took to the streets recently demanding the removal of Bolsonaro over his handling of the pandemic. Indeed, it seems that public opinion has finally turned overwhelmingly against Bolsonaro, and Lula is expected to trounce him in the 2022 elections. However, in a rather unsurprising manner, and reminiscent of his idol Trump, Bolsonaro announced just a few days ago that he may not accept the results of the 2022 election under the current voting system. How likely is the chance that the generals, on whom Bolsonaro has relied on from the first day he got into power, will stay the course and support an attempt of his to stay in power even if he loses next year\u2019s presidential election?",
    "output": "Since 2018, Bolsonaro has been claiming that the only way he can be defeated in an election is by fraud. He\u2019s even claimed (of course, without evidence) that Dilma actually lost the 2014 election, which she won handily by over 3 million votes, mostly on sharp class lines, by historical standards a slim margin. He\u2019s now stepped up the rhetoric, preemptively charging the 2022 election with attempted fraud by his political enemies and telling a crowd of supporters a few weeks ago that, \u201cElections next year will be clean. Either we have clean elections in Brazil or we don\u2019t have elections\u201d (Jornal do Brasil, 7-08-21). Not exactly unfamiliar. Right now, Lula is well ahead in the polls, just as in 2018, when measures were taken to bar his candidacy. There are legitimate concerns of a recurrence. Parliamentary inquiries into the devastating mishandling of the pandemic by Bolsonaro\u2019s government are now reportedly reaching the military. The three branches of the armed services recently released a statement declaring that no inquiry that impugns the honor of the military will be tolerated. There have been reports of steps that might be preparation for a military coup, perhaps modeled on the 1964 coup that installed the first of the vicious \u201cNational Security States\u201d that terrorized the hemisphere for 20 years. The pretext for overthrowing the mildly reformist Goulart government in 1964 was the ritual appeal to save the country from \u201cCommunism.\u201d Something similar could be concocted today. How would Washington react? There are precedents that suggest an answer. One is 1964. The military coup that overthrew the parliamentary government was lauded by Kennedy-Johnson Ambassador to Brazil Lincoln Gordon as \u201cthe most decisive victory for freedom in the mid-twentieth century.\u201d As I discuss inYear 501, it was a \u201cdemocratic rebellion\u201d that would help in \u201crestraining left-wing excesses\u201d and should \u201ccreate a greatly improved climate for private investment\u201d in the hands of the \u201cdemocratic forces\u201d now in charge. After 21 years of rule, Latin America scholar Stephen Rabe comments inThe Most Dangerous Area in the World, the \u201cdemocratic forces\u201d left the country in \u201cthe same category as the less developed African or Asian countries when it came to social welfare indices\u201d (malnutrition, infant mortality, etc.), with conditions of inequality and suffering rarely matched elsewhere, but a grand success for foreign investors and domestic privilege. That\u2019s putting aside the \u201csystematic use of torture\u201d and other crimes of state documented by the Church-run Truth Commission during the dictatorship\u2019s last days. We should also recall that the reaction to the Brazil coup \u2014 and possible involvement in it \u2014 was no exception. Rather, it was the norm after 1962, when JFK changed the mission of the Latin American military from anachronistic \u201chemispheric defense\u201d to very live \u201cinternal security.\u201d The predictable results were described by Charles Maechling, who led U.S. counterinsurgency and internal defense planning from 1961 to 1966. Kennedy\u2019s 1962 decision, he wrote, shifted the U.S. stand from toleration \u201cof the rapacity and cruelty of the Latin American military\u201d to \u201cdirect complicity\u201d in their crimes, to U.S. support for \u201cthe methods of Heinrich Himmler\u2019s extermination squads.\u201d Those who might innocently believe that things have changed can turn to the Obama-Clinton reaction to the military coup in Honduras in 2009, overthrowing the mildly reformist Zelaya government. Their support for the coup, almost alone, helped turn Honduras into one of the murder capitals of the world, stimulating a flood of terrified refugees now cruelly and illegally turned back at the U.S. border, if they can make it that far through the barriers imposed by U.S. clients. The rich and ugly record might suggest something about Washington\u2019s possible reaction to actions by the Brazilian military to \u201csave the country from Communism.\u201d"

Polychroniou: Noam, with people still arguing about winners and losers from the 2018 midterm elections (and there is clearly a lot to say about what those elections mean), what do you consider to be the most striking features of the latest manifestation of American democracy in action?",
    "output": "The most striking features are brutally clear. Humanity faces two imminent existential threats: environmental catastrophe and nuclear war. These were virtually ignored in the campaign rhetoric and general coverage. There was plenty of criticism of the Trump administration, but scarcely a word about by far the most ominous positions the administration has taken: increasing the already dire threat of nuclear war, and racing to destroy the physical environment that organized human society needs in order to survive. These are the most critical and urgent questions that have arisen in all of human history. The fact that they scarcely arose in the campaign is truly stunning \u2014 and carries some important, if unpleasant, lessons about our moral and intellectual culture. To be sure, not everyone was ignoring these matters. They were front and center for those who are constantly vigilant in their bitter class war to preserve their immense power and privilege. Several states had important ballot initiatives addressing the impending environmental catastrophe. The fossil fuel industry spent huge, sometimes record-breaking, sums to defeat the initiatives \u2014 including a carbon tax in the mostly Democratic state of Washington \u2014 and mostly succeeded. We should recognize that these are extraordinary crimes against humanity. They proceed with little notice. The Democrats helped defeat these critically important initiatives by ignoring them. They scarcely mentioned them \u201cin digital or TV ads, in their campaign literature or on social media,\u201d a New York Times survey found. Nor, of course, were they mentioned by the Republicans, whose leadership is dedicated to driving humanity off the cliff as soon as possible \u2014 in full knowledge of what they are doing, as easily demonstrated. The Times article goes on to explain that \u201cEnvironmental activists and political scientists say it is a reflection of the issue\u2019s perpetual low ranking among voters, even Democratic voters, and of the intense polarization along party lines that has developed around global warming.\u201d The article failed to add that this assessment is an incredible indictment of the country and its political, social, economic and media institutions, all of which, so the assessment claims, have sunk to such a level of depravity that the question of whether organized human society can survive in any minimally tolerable form, in the near future, is of little consequence. Whether that unspoken indictment is correct, we cannot be sure. It is perhaps of some significance that one Democratic candidate, Sean Casten, flipped a Republican district while making impending climate disaster the centerpiece of his campaign. There is plenty of competition for moral depravity in the current remarkable moment of human history. Perhaps the prize goes to a bureaucracy, maybe in honor of Kafka: Trump\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Right in the midst of the campaign, it produced a detailed study calling for an end to regulations on emissions, with a rational argument: extrapolating current trends, it turns out that by the end of the century the game will be over. Automotive emissions don\u2019t contribute very much to the catastrophe, so there isn\u2019t any point trying to limit them. In brief, let\u2019s rob while the planet burns, putting poor Nero in the shadows. This surely qualifies as a contender for the most evil document in history. Again, not an issue in the campaign. There have been many monsters in the past ... but it would be hard to find one who was dedicated to undermining the prospects for survival of organized human society, not in the distant future \u2014 in order to put a few more dollars in overstuffed pockets. It\u2019s hard to find words to describe what is happening before our eyes. The same is true of the second truly existential threat: nuclear war. A few weeks before the election, Trump announced that the US is withdrawing from the INF treaty, which eliminated short-range missiles deployed in Western Europe and Russia \u2014 extremely hazardous weapons, which have only a few minutes flight-time to Moscow, posing a decapitation threat, a sudden attack that would destroy any possibility of response. That, of course, sharply increases the danger of a nuclear response to warnings given by automated systems that have often failed in the past, thus ending all of us. Anyone familiar with the record knows that it\u2019s a virtual miracle that we have so far avoided terminal nuclear war. The threat, which was already grave, was heightened by the Trump nuclear posture review that authorized new destabilizing weapons and lowered the threshold for nuclear attack. This latest move increases the threat further. Scarcely a mention on the campaign trail or in coverage. The US is withdrawing from the treaty on the grounds that China is not a partner and that the Russians have violated it \u2014 they in turn claim that the US has violated it. It\u2019s plain how to address these problems: through inspections and diplomacy, neither of which has been attempted. Rather, let\u2019s just blithely increase the threat of total destruction. And let\u2019s ignore all of this in the vast outpourings during the political campaign. Again, we have to ask some serious questions about the prevailing moral and intellectual culture \u2014 and about the urgency of providing remedies, very soon. Let\u2019s put aside what are merely the most significant questions in human history, and turn to what is within the realm of discussion. striking fact about the election is that it once again demonstrated the failure of the Democratic Party as a whole to deal with issues that matter to working people. While working-class people of color largely supported the Democratic Party, even more than before, the party lost the non\u2013college educated white population. What\u2019s more, it seems to be of little concern, at least to Democratic Party leaders, the \u201cWall Street Democrats\u201d as they are sometimes called. They were exultant about their successes in the affluent suburbs, where normally Republican voters were disgusted by Trump\u2019s vulgarity. Whether they come naturally or are feigned, Trump\u2019s antics help keep his white working-class constituency in line while his party stabs them in the back at every turn, meanwhile serving its real constituency, great wealth and corporate power, with impressive dedication. The betrayal of working-class America could hardly be clearer, though fortunately, some are breaking free of the treachery. One positive feature of the midterms was the success of a diverse group of young progressive candidates, mostly women \u2014 a tribute to the popular activism of recent years, and a hopeful sign for the future, if it can expand and flourish. On the surface, it seems that Trump\u2019s success with much of the voting constituency can be attributed to racist and xenophobic appeals, particularly concerning the imminent threat of \u201cinvasion\u201d by hordes of terrorists and criminals approaching our borders that he focused his tantrums on up to the election \u2013 then dropping the topic when it was no longer needed to rally the faithful. Few seem to have recalled that Trump was pulling a leaf from Reagan\u2019s playbook. In 1985, our intrepid leader strapped on his cowboy boots and declared a national emergency because Nicaraguan troops were a two days\u2019 drive from Harlingen, Texas \u2014 and people didn\u2019t collapse in laughter. Trump made a similar move in warning that if people fleeing from misery and oppression (misery and oppression for which we are largely responsible) reach our borders they\u2019ll try to kill us all. Heavily armed militias travelled to the border to back up the thousands of troops deployed to defend us, and it seems to have worked. Surveys report that people did vote for Trump because only he could save us from destruction by these criminal hordes. That also carries some lessons. But when we ask why Trump\u2019s strategy works, we find something deeper, which extends pretty much worldwide, with particularities from place to place. In conditions of economic distress, a sense of hopelessness, justified contempt for institutions, and understandable anger and resentment about what is being done to them, people can become easy prey to demagogues who direct their anger toward scapegoats, typically those even more vulnerable, and who foster the symptoms that tend to rise to the surface under such circumstances. That\u2019s been happening, worldwide. We see it in election after election in many countries, and in other ways. In the US, working-class people have suffered 40 years of stagnation while wealth concentrates in very few hands, leading to staggering inequality. The Democrats have ignored all this, and worse, have carried forward the neoliberal policies that took off with Reagan and Thatcher and have imposed these consequences, by design. And for the designers, the neoliberal programs have been brilliantly successful, in ways that we need not review here. Despite low unemployment, wage growth, after a rise in 2014-15, is now barely keeping up with inflation while corporate profits are skyrocketing, particularly for the predatory financial institutions, which emerged from the crisis for which they were responsible even richer and more powerful than before. A side effect is that the country\u2019s wealth is being shifted from R&D, innovation and product development, to financial transactions in the interests of the very rich. Fine for them, but disastrous for the health and future of the society. The concentration of wealth and enhancement of corporate power translate automatically to decline of democracy. Research in academic political science has revealed that a large majority of voters are literally disenfranchised, in that their own representatives pay no attention to their wishes but listen to the voices of the donor class. It is furthermore well established that elections are pretty much bought: electability, hence policy, is predictable with remarkable precision from the single variable of campaign spending, both for the executive and Congress. Thomas Ferguson\u2019s work is particularly revealing, going far back and including the 2016 election. And that is a bare beginning. Legislation is commonly shaped, even written, by corporate lobbyists, while representatives who sign it have their eyes on funding for the next election. The midterms highlighted other ominous developments. The Republicans increased their Senate majority \u2014 with barely 40 percent of the votes cast. Right now, 60 senators are elected by states with 25 percent of the population, which means some 15 percent of the vote (mostly rural, white, religious, skeptical of science, heavily armed). And the tendency is increasing. It\u2019s hard to see how some form of civil conflict can be avoided unless the Democrats reverse course sharply and become a political party that doesn\u2019t simply abandon the working class to its bitter class enemy, as they have done for 40 years."

    "output": "In 1895, the highly successful campaign manager Mark Hanna famously said: \u201cThere are two things that are important in politics. The first ismoney,and I can\u2019t remember what the second one is.\u201d Those who control the wealth of the country have their own priorities, primarily self-enrichment and enhancement of decision-making power. And these are the priorities that prevail in a neoliberal democracy with the annoying public dismissed to the back rooms where they belong. The CEOs of major banks surely understand the extraordinary threat of environmental catastrophe but are increasing investment in fossil fuels because that\u2019s where the money is. Like the energy corporations, they are hardly eager to support candidates warning of the serious crimes they are committing. Lockheed-Martin and its cohorts are quite happy to see vast increases in the military budget and are surely delighted with such declarations as the Trump administration\u2019s new National Defense Strategy, just released by the US Institute of Peace (lacking a sense of irony, the bureaucracy is quite happy to caricature Orwell). This somber document warns that our dangerously depleted military, which almost overwhelms the rest of the world combined, might not be able to prevail in a two-front war against Russia and China. Of course, neither military industry nor the distinguished authors of the report believe that such a war could even be fought without terminal destruction, but it\u2019s a great way to siphon taxpayer dollars away from absurdities like health and education and into the deserving pockets of the captains of industry and finance. Not many political figures will dare to dismiss such awesome threats to our security. As for the nastiness, it\u2019s largely a result of the drift to the right of both parties during the neoliberal years, the Democrats becoming what used to be called \u201cmoderate Republicans\u201d (or often worse) and the Republicans drifting off the spectrum, with devotion to wealth and corporate power so extreme that they cannot possibly win elections on their actual policies. They have therefore been compelled to mobilize voting constituencies on \u201ccultural issues,\u201d diverting attention away from actual policies. To keep them in line, it\u2019s natural for the leadership to demonize the political opposition as not merely wrong but intent on demolishing their most deeply held values \u2014 and for the latter to resort to contempt for the \u201cdeplorables.\u201d Soon antagonisms degenerate to warfare. There are many illustrations of how the Republican leadership has sought to organize a voting constituency, some of which we\u2019ve discussed before. One revealing case is abortion rights. In the \u201860s, the Republican Party was strongly pro-choice, including the leadership (Reagan, Ford, George H.W. Bush and others). Same with voters. In 1972, two-thirds of Republicans believed abortion to be a private matter, with no government involvement. Nixon and his cohorts realized that they could attract the Catholic vote, traditionally Democratic, by adopting an anti-abortion plank. Later in the \u201870s, evangelicals began to organize for political action. Among their demands was maintaining segregated schools. Republican operative Paul Weyrich recognized an opportunity. An open call for segregated schools wouldn\u2019t work, but if the Republican Party pretended to oppose abortion, it could pick up the huge evangelical vote, now a core part of Trump\u2019s voting base. The leadership accordingly shifted to passionate \u201cpro-life\u201d advocates, including those who it is sometimes believed had some character and honesty, like Bush I, who shifted along with the rest. Meanwhile the actual constituency of the Republican Party remains great wealth and corporate power, even more dramatically so under Trump. It is quite an achievement to serve this actual constituency with dedication while maintaining a hold on the voting base. As their voting base shrinks, Republican leaders understand that the GOP is becoming a minority party, which is why they are so dedicated to finding modes of voter suppression and packing the courts with reactionaries who will support their efforts. It should also be noted that popular opinion differs from the party leadership on many central issues. But as already mentioned, since the majority of the population is disenfranchised, it doesn\u2019t matter much. To take just one example, for 40 years of polling the population has strongly favored higher taxes on the rich \u2014 as taxes on the rich decline."

In particular, the system is radically rigged against any challenge to the governing duopoly. To develop a basis for a third party would require a serious and sustained effort in popular mobilization \u2014 not impossible, but not now on the horizon. There do seem to be possibilities to shift the character of the Democratic Party, at least back to its modern New Deal origins, and beyond (it already is considerably beyond in some respects as a result of the civilizing effect of the activism of the \u201860s and its aftermath). There are possibilities for development of independent parties, beginning at the local level, adopting fusion policies for more general elections, perhaps gaining enough traction to take part more actively in the political system. But we should never forget that electoral politics, while not to be dismissed, should not be the prime focus of serious radical political action, which aims to change the basic institutions that undergird the political system, to dismantle hegemonic ideologies, and to help develop the kind of mass consciousness that must be the basis for badly \u2014 even desperately \u2014 needed social and political change."

    "output": "I mean the culture of dominance through violence; the minds of Americans have been bombarded, maybe first of all by US politicians who are used to acting violating the law, inside the country and abroad; they have no limits to achieving their goals, so in one\u2019s mind in America there is a natural thought, \u201cwhy to be tolerant, to respect the law and differences?\u201d. Your view, please, Doctor Chomsky. The United States is a rare country that has been at war almost every year since the first day of its founding. Almost constant war. One reason for the American Revolution was that the British had barred invasion of \u201cIndian country,\u201d the homelands of the many Indian nations beyond the Appalachian mountains. The colonists wanted to conquer and settle those territories, as did major land speculators like George Washington. As soon as the British barrier was removed, the invasions began, pretty much wars of extermination as the leadership recognized. That persisted through the 19th century \u2013 and along the way, the US conquered half of Mexico. It goes on from there with hardly a break. Laments about Washington\u2019s \u201cendless wars\u201d in this millennium are somewhat misleading. At the same time, the US instituted the most vicious system of slavery in human history. It was, crucially, race-based slavery, unlike most others, so the mark of slavery persists. Formally, slavery ended after the civil war, and indeed Blacks had a decade of freedom, which they used very effectively. That ended with a North-South compact in 1877, which allowed the former slave states to do as they wished. What they did was introduce \u201cslavery by another name,\u201d the title of one of the best books on the topic. The device was to criminalize black life. The incarcerated black population became a wonderful workforce for agribusiness and the industrial revolution in the South \u2013 no worries about discipline, wages, workers\u2019 rights. The chain gangs are a familiar symbol. That lasted pretty much until World War II, along with severe discrimination in the North. Then followed a period of formal freedom, but limited. For example, Federal Housing and support for higher education were denied to Blacks. By 1980, with Reagan, a new program of criminalization began, reaching to the present. This form of \u201cexceptionalism\u201d cannot fail to leave its impact on American culture. Though free and progressive in many ways, American culture and society have not erased these deep stains, as is all too obvious in international behavior and domestic affairs. This is not of course the way US history and society have been depicted in the educational system, media, and cultural institutions, though there have been important moves towards recognition of reality, largely traceable to the civilizing impact of 1960s activism and its aftermath. We are seeing President Donald Trump much more concerned about jailing protesters, pressing like no other president before, governors to prosecute people who are taking to the streets, than a concern to see justice for the crime against Floyd, and to discuss solutions to issues such as violence, racism, and inequality in the US."

    "output": "I hope it is true, but it is not obvious. He may in fact use the current protests over the police murder of George Floyd to his advantage, playing the law-and-order card that is second nature to brutal authoritarians. There is no space to run through the record here, but Trump\u2019s demolition of the system of pandemic preparation that was in place, his annual defunding of health-related elements of the government, and his cancelling of programs in which US and Chinese scientists cooperated in investigating coronaviruses, all left the US singularly unprepared for the pandemic that scientists had been predicting. This is over and above the neoliberal assault of 40 years that has shattered the general society while providing enormous to a tiny sector and greatly empowering predatory financial institutions and other parts of the corporate sector. Trump\u2019s wrecking ball didn\u2019t stop there. When China provided all relevant information in mid-January, governments with some concern for their populations reacted, primarily in East Asia and Oceania, and by now have the situation pretty much under control. Others varied. Trump\u2019s US is at the bottom of the barrel, sharing this distinction with Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil. Trump is directly responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans, many more to come. Not surprisingly, he is flailing around desperately to find scapegoats for his crimes. He retains the support of his primary constituency, extreme wealth and corporate power, whom he has served loyally. Also the support of a huge voting bloc of Evangelical Christians, along with relatively affluent rural and suburban whites, white supremacists, and some other sectors whom he has handled with the brilliance of a skilled confidence man \u2013 stabbing them in the back with his legislative programs while presenting himself as their loving savior. Malevolence. This does not begin to touch Trump\u2019s malevolence. His most colossal crime is his dedication to destroying organized human life on earth in the near future in order to increase the profits of his prime constituency. This is no exaggeration. Martin Luther King, Jr. killing in 1968, which provoked protests similar to the ones we are seeing these days, hasn\u2019t stopped the drastic consequences of the deep racism in the United States. Neither the killing of Rodney King, a driver in Los Angeles in 1992 by the police that generated unrest across the country, nor Barack Obama\u2019s election, the first black president in the history of the US, has solved the issue, on the contrary."

That led to a week of enormous protests in Los Angeles in which over 60 people were killed. President George H. W. Bush called in the US military to restore order. There were reactions elsewhere, but protests were mostly limited to Los Angeles. The reaction this time is very different. That reflects the growing awareness of the racist pathology among at least parts of the population. There is a long way to go, but the core challenge is to continue and escalate this process \u2013 while fending off the inevitable efforts of Trump and his associates to restore an even harsher version of what came before."

As we are concerned about the historical review of the Palestinian struggle, and considering your assessment, how do you see the possibility of exiting this impasse?",
    "output": "The earlier Madrid negotiations broke down because the Palestinian delegation, led by Dr. Haidar Abdel-Shafi, insisted \u2013 quite properly \u2013 on termination of Israel\u2019s policy of expanding illegal settlements. The US and Israel would not agree. The late chairman Yassir Arafat, undercutting the Palestinian delegation through the Norway channel, did not insist on this \u2013 in fact, insisted on almost nothing apart from the recognition of the PLO (nothing about the Palestinian Declaration of Independence, or anything else concerning Palestinian national rights). After Oslo, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin initiated new settlement programs. The US and Israel quickly broke the Agreements explicitly by moving to separate Gaza and the West Bank. There were no steps towards Palestinian independence under Rabin or his successor Shimon Peres, who made it explicit, as he left office in 1996, that there could be no Palestinian state. The first Israeli government to admit the possibility of a Palestinian state was the Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s administration that succeeded Peres. In response to a query by a journalist, David Bar-Illan, director of Communications and Policy Planning in the office of the Prime Minister Netanyahu, said that the Palestinians could call whatever Israel decided to leave to them \u201ca state,\u201d if they liked; or they could call it \u201cfried chicken.\u201d Subsequent negotiations collapsed in ways that I cannot go into here, though the Taba negotiations in January 2001, called off by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, seemed to be making some progress, according to participants. The way out of the impasse is for Israel and its US backer to join almost all of the rest of the world in agreeing to an acceptable version of a two-state settlement based on the internationally recognised border (the green line), with fair and limited land swaps."

    "input": "What do you think Palestinians should do about this situation? Is there another option?",
    "output": "In the short term, there are two options: (1) the international consensus on two states; (2) Israel\u2019s program of creating a Greater Israel that integrates into Israel whatever it wants in the West Bank, leaving Palestinians in dozens of unviable cantons and under constant harassment, or worse. There is a good deal of talk about a \u201cone-state settlement,\u201d but that is highly unrealistic under current circumstances. Unlike (1), it has virtually no international support, and Israel is strongly opposed because it would pose the dreaded \u201cdemographic problem\u201d (too many Arabs in a Jewish state). That problem will not arise under (2) as it is being implemented, by-passing and isolating Palestinian population concentrations and expelling Palestinians from the areas Israel intends to keep. One can imagine a process beginning with (1), followed by gradual erosion of the Israel-Palestine border (commercial, cultural and other contacts), leading to some form of federation and maybe on to true binationalism \u2013 which is not a \u201cfulfillment of Zionist dreams\u201d for the large majority of pre-state Zionists, but a position that had support from much of the Israeli kibbutz movement (Hashomer Hatzair), small groups of intellectuals (Brit Shalom), and some others farther to the left (Kalvarisky\u2019s League for Arab-Jewish Rapprochement). Along the way, the legitimacy of the borders should be questioned. They were, after all, imposed by Britain and France for their own interests, with no concern for the indigenous population. Now they are bristling with armaments, but that was not always so. In fact, in the early \u201850s, while hiking in northern Israel, I crossed the unmarked border by accident. Erosion of national borders can be salutary, as in post-World War II Europe. The best hope for Palestinians now is to create pressures for a diplomatic settlement, cooperating with like-minded Israelis and supporters abroad. That has always been a priority for successful national liberation movements. The most important case is the US, and I think there are significant opportunities to bring about important changes in US policies."

    "output": "There are some similarities, but important differences too. The analogy is imperfect. Within Israel, there is severe discrimination, but it is not Apartheid. In the occupied territories, the situation is much worse than Apartheid. Israel basically wants Palestinians to disappear, the norm for settler-colonial societies (like the US, for example). South Africa, on the other hand, needed its Black population. They were the workforce. The Bantustans were horrible, but South Africa made efforts to sustain them and to gain international recognition for them. And the international situation is much different. Apartheid was strongly opposed internationally \u2013 arms embargoes, sanctions, boycott and divestment. Thirty years before the fall of the Apartheid regime, the South African foreign minister, recognising that the regime was becoming an international pariah, informed the US Ambassador, in effect, that they were relying on Washington to defend them against international opprobrium. And indeed Ronald Reagan was the last world leader to support the Apartheid state, though by then American opinion, and crucially US business, favoured overcoming Apartheid and government policy was beginning to shift. There was another crucial difference: Cuba. Cuba played a major role in liberating southern Africa, beating back the South African invasion of Angola and shattering the myth of white supremacy both within South Africa and in the surrounding regions. The situation with regard to Israel-Palestine is far different today."

Especially since Iran cannot be exempted from its accountability in creating this tension, through its continuous interference in the neighboring countries, leading to less attention to the Palestinian issue?",
    "output": "Iran is no doubt seeking to extend its influence in the region, in the way all powers do. US aggression has created new opportunities for Iran in Iraq and Afghanistan. Iran is supporting the Assad regime, and Hezbollah in Lebanon. These developments are naturally regarded as unwelcome by the US, Israel and Gulf States, threatening their regional dominance. Even US intelligence agrees that Iran was living up to the nuclear agreement despite regular US violations. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the agreement does significantly heighten tensions in the region. It is unclear whether Iran will respond by returning to Uranium enrichment, though they are entitled to. If it does, US-Israel might present that as the pretext for a military attack, in addition to their cyberattack (an act of war, under US doctrine) and assassination of scientists. The consequences could be grim."

In this context, you mentioned that the public support for Israel in the US was drifting towards the right. You also mentioned that a day might soon come where Israel would no longer be able to count on the support expected half a century ago? Current facts indicate the predominance of the populist right logic represented by Trump and a possible generic attack on the libertarian values not only in the US but in Europe too. What are the factors that can contribute to an expected change in the American society and in the American legislators?",
    "output": "It seems on the surface as though US support for extremist Israeli positions is solid, but that picture is misleading. Israeli actions in recent years have alienated public opinion among more liberal sectors and the young (including many Jewish Americans). Self-identified Democrats are now more sympathetic to Palestinians than to Israelis. Increasingly, support for Israel is based mostly on Evangelical churches and the nationalist and often racist (anti-Muslim) right. Major institutions, notably the Presbyterian Church, have adopted boycott-divestment programs, also focusing on US corporations involved in the occupation. Major human rights organisations have called for an arms embargo against Israel \u2013 and in fact, under US law (the Leahy Law) a strong case can be made for that. Much the same is true throughout the world. For some years, Israeli strategic analysts have recognised that Israel can no longer count on support from countries where there is some concern for human rights and must ally itself more closely with more reactionary and authoritarian sectors. That is a major change from not many years ago. The situation in the US is fluid, and there could be positive changes ahead."

Do you see that American society still owns this ability? As we are witnessing, the right-wing populist wave have become a growing stream on both sides of the Atlantic fuelled by (immigration, Islamophobia, fear of Russia and China)?",
    "output": "There is a good deal to say about the history, but putting that aside, while such tendencies are clear, it\u2019s important to recognise that there are counter-tendencies too. The most popular political figure in the US, according to polls, is Bernie Sanders. His success in the 2016 elections was a sharp break from American political history, in which elections have been substantially determined by massive funding. Sanders had no support from the usual sources (corporations, great wealth), was ignored or denigrated by the media, and even used the scare word \u201csocialism\u201d (meaning social democracy). He probably would have won the Democratic nomination had it not been for machinations of Obama-Clinton party managers, and the popular movements spawned by his campaign, along with others, are having considerable success. There are similar developments in Europe (Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party, Podemos, DiEM 25, and others). In general, centrist political institutions are collapsing in a prevailing atmosphere of anger, fear, and contempt for institutions, largely engendered by the regressive impact on the population of the neoliberal/austerity programs of the past generation. Such conditions often foster latent anti-social attitudes and exaggerated fears. For example, popular estimates of the number of immigrants are far higher than actual numbers, particularly in the US (much the same is true of estimates of foreign aid and of recipients of government benefits). The general circumstances bring to mind Gramsci\u2019s words in Mussolini\u2019s prison cells: \u201c\u2018The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born.\u201d"

How do you see the Palestinian boycott movement that has achieved remarkable successes and represented a great existential concern for Israel and which pushed it to release threats to eliminate Palestinian leaders?",
    "output": "For the reasons I mentioned, unlike the South African case, the question of sanctions does not arise, yet at least; perhaps it will if matters progress successfully. So the real questions are boycott and divestment. These can be powerful tools. And as always for serious activism, it is necessary to think through carefully the impact of tactical choices. For the first time to my knowledge, a BDS movement was launched 20 years ago by Uri Avnery\u2019s Gush Emunim, directed against the occupation. The \u2018BDS movement\u2019 has become a major international campaign under Palestinian initiative since 2005, with many success and much promise. Experience has shown, I think, that focus on the occupation is the most effective tactic, the tactic that really concerns Israeli leaders and that can energise significant popular support, as in cases I mentioned earlier. The issues are clear and unambiguous, the stand entirely principled. The actions are not, as often happens, open to diversion away from the plight of Palestinians to side issues (academic freedom, double standards, etc.). They do not elicit backlash that sometimes overwhelms the actions undertaken. They could lead to policy changes, both in Israel and abroad, as they gain in force and scale. Choice of tactics can surely be debated, but it is important to bear in mind that it should be debated. Choice of tactics should always be considered carefully in terms of consequences for the victims and opportunity costs \u2013 the course not taken and what it might have achieved. These are never trivial considerations. There is no room for dogmatism or inflexible doctrine. That much at least should be second nature to activists."

    "output": "Well, there is many factors. Each area has its own special history. India is not the same as Hungary, not the same as the United States. One crucial factor over much of the world, certainly Europe and the United staes is the socio-economic policies that have been introduced since, basically since Reagan and Tatcher \u2013 marketization, public services, undermining the role of the state, transferring wealth and control to private hands. You take that and the effects are pretty obvious. There has been concentration of wealth and stagnation for the rest of the population. By now in the United States, 0.1 percent of the population have over 20 percent of the wealth and half the population have negative net worth, that means people just live week to week, that\u2019s half the population. Real wages in the United States have about the same purchasing power that they had in the 1970s. The sharp concentration of wealth automatically leads to a decline of functioning democracy because of the tendency of the wealthy to dominate the political process. I mean in Europe, it\u2019s been exacerbated even further by the structure of the EU, which essentially takes decision making over major issues away from the national states to the unelected bureaucracy in Brussels. On top of that they have the northern German banks looking over their shoulders. They have been following the austerity policies which make the neoliberal policies even worse. The effects of all this are pretty detectable, lot of anger and resentment, bitterness, condemnation of the centrist political institutions that have been running things. Happens here too. It\u2019s the kind of situation where some guy can come along, Trump, (inaudible) in Hungary, or Bolsonaro in Brazil, and try to turn this anger into real pathology."

    "output": "Karthik:Pakistan was always presented as an enemy and Kashmir was always presented as something that just belongs to India. So, I think there is more than just the economics at play. I was giving talks in India about 16 years I guess.. And I happened to mention in one talk, the Indian repression in Kashmir after the fraudulent 1987 elections. The next day, I was giving a talk somewhere else, there was a big BJP demonstration and the rest of the time I was there, the people who were organizing my talk insisted I have police protection. Karthik:I believe that was the first talk of yours I attended your talk and I believe it was in October of 2001 or somewhere in late 2001. Yea.. sounds about right. Karthik:Because I remember having an email conversation with you subsequently. I see. Yea, the support for what Modi did in Kashmir is overwhelming among the Hindu population. Karthik:Right. Yea, I think there is more than economics. I think the fissures, the minds of people have already been fissured by ignorance and propaganda. One thing that\u2019s happened is the press has been pretty much muzzled. They are very uncritical. Karthik:I\u2019m going to check the camera to make sure that its recording, as I have very poor habits in terms of handling that machine. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have too much time."

    "output": "minutes. Keep going. Karthik:You indicated in recent interviews, that whats we are seeing in the world is not Nazism. Even though there are parallels, it\u2019s not exactly whats happening in Germany. Would you say that\u2019s true in the case of India? Because India is building detention centers to house millions of Muslim citizens after them labeling them illegal immigrants. What we are seeing is the symptoms of fascism without the fascist ideology. Fascism meant something. It meant a powerful state, under the control of the Nazi or fascist party, which controlled everything. It even controlled business. We are not seeing that in India. The state does not control big business. And the same here. We have many of the aspects of fascism. Concentration camps at the border. You have many of the aspects of fascism. Concentration camps at the border, you know racism, and so on.. But business is not under control. [inaudible] they called it in Germany. The state is so powerful, it controlled not just labor of course, but business. In fact, every organization. There are signs of that. For example, when Trump orders every company to get out of China, there is a touch of that. But notice that they didn\u2019t do it. Karthik:Right. Right. They don\u2019t have that kind of power yet. They don\u2019t have that kind of power. Karthik:So, do you think, you know, two questions. The first one: Did you notice that in Kashmir, you know P. Chidambaram, Mr. P. Chidambaram, who is the former home minister of India, a congress politician. As a home minister, he was administering the occupation of Kashmir. It was brutal but not as brutal as it is today. Congress has a rotten record on Kashmir. Karthik:Right. Under Congress, there were massive atrocities in Kashmir. Karthik:Right. Maybe you can give some other examples in the world. But he was celebrated when he was administering the occupation of Kashmir. But the moment he criticized the BJPs occupation of Kashmir, the moment he criticized it as reducing Kashmir to a \u201cvassal state\u201d, he\u2019s been in prison."

They support freedom movements in enemy states, but not in countries that we support. They can be as repressive and brutal as they like. Rightwing can sometimes be a little worse, but it\u2019s not that different. Karthik:Yeah. Take say Obama. You look at the refugees fleeing from Central America. The plurality are from Honduras. Why? Because in 2009 there was a military coup that threw out a mildly reformist President. It was denounced throughout the continent, Obama and Clinton refused to denounce. And it turned into a horror story, people starting to flee."

Until about 1967 and by that time, Vietnam had practically been destroyed. I mean I worked for many years, trying to get some opposition to the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, the worst genocide since second world war. And the US was backing it the whole time. Take say Turkey. In the 1990s, Turkey was carrying out massive repression and slaughter of Kurds. Almost all the arms were coming from Clinton. You couldn\u2019t get any reporting and you couldn\u2019t get any protests. To this day, nobody knows about it. There were a couple of people, I was one at the time. It\u2019s not easy."

He had a bunch of thugs break into the democratic party headquarters. You don\u2019t attack powerful people. Because they fight back. But the major crimes, they don\u2019t care. Karthik:Right. In a way, you are seeing that about whats happening with the Kurds. That\u2019s not going to be a reason for impeachment. No. That\u2019s not a reason. In fact, when Lindsey Graham and others, condemn Trump for leaving the Kurds to the mercy of the Turks, what they are saying is this is going to harm the fight against ISIS. What about the Kurds?

    "input": "Do you believe we have moved into this new era? Do you see the threat of extinction as fundamentally changing the way the Left movements have to think about what they\u2019re doing?",
    "output": "It\u2019s very difficult to talk about the Left as an entity because it\u2019s a collection of very disparate movements involved in all sorts of endeavors, many of them quite valuable. The Left needs to become unified and integrated because whatever particular issue you\u2019re working on, this crisis of potential extinction is overshadowing it. There must be international solidarity. The situation for organizing here is not that bleak. If you take a look at the last election, Clinton won a majority of the votes. The outcome has to do with special features of the U.S. electoral system, which is pretty regressive by world standards. Among younger people, Clinton did win a substantial majority. More important, Sanders won an overwhelming majority. That\u2019s the younger part of the population. You take a look at Trump supporters. Many of them voted for Obama. In 2008, they were seduced by his slogan which was Hope and Change. They pretty quickly found out that they\u2019re not getting hope and they\u2019re not getting change. Now they voted for someone else who\u2019s preaching hope and change, different orientation. They want change. They\u2019re right. The situation that much of the workforce and lower middle class has lived in is, it\u2019s not starvation, but it\u2019s stagnation. The system has been designed. It\u2019s not a matter of economic laws. It\u2019s policy and decisions, which have been quite harmful to a large mass of the population. In fact, a majority. It\u2019s also undermined democracy, both here and even more so in Europe. There\u2019s a natural and justified call for change. These are opportunities for the Left. Many of the people who voted for Trump could have voted for Sanders. lot of people are saying now, they\u2019re putting a lot of onus of responsibility on Obama and on Clinton. The Left has been highly critical of neoliberalism. But it hasn\u2019t been seen broadly by the population. Particularly the working-class parts of the population that you\u2019re identifying as being really harmed by this, as that somehow neither the Left nor the Democratic Party is really speaking to them. It\u2019s speaking to coastal elites, it\u2019s speaking to educated people, speaking maybe to young educated people. It\u2019s not speaking to them. Not speaking to people who are really deprived. The Left should be working with and for the African-American community, it should be working on civil rights, it should be working for gay rights, for women\u2019s rights, and so on. That\u2019s fine. What it has dropped pretty much is class issues. Would you encourage the Left to rethink the class issue and economic opportunities\u2014that maybe a Sanders-style development will help reconfigure the Left? Not that it abandons the most depressed people in the society, but it finds a way to deal with larger forces of inequality, as you say, as integrated within the larger capitalist systems. It\u2019s certainly a must. The so-called identity politics has led to great successes, but when they are designed and presented in such a way that they appear to be an attack on the lifestyle, values, commitments of a large part of the population, there\u2019s going to be reaction. That shouldn\u2019t be done."

Some of the people who live in working-class areas, white working-class areas, they look at that and they say, \u201cWhat are you talking about? We\u2019re not seeing this privilege.\u201d Does this require the Left to re-assess its vocabulary?",
    "output": "It\u2019s not just about our vocabulary. It\u2019s about an understanding. Actually, Arlie Hochschild\u2019s book is very revealing in this respect. \u201cStrangers in Their Own Land.\u201d Hochschild is a noted sociologist. We know the story. She\u2019s lived for many years in the bayou country in Louisiana and gave a very sympathetic understanding, conception of what the people are thinking and why, from a point of view of a Berkeley progressive, which she is. She was accepted into the community. It\u2019s very revealing. The images she uses, which they accepted as the correct ones, is that people . . . they see themselves as standing in a line. They\u2019ve been working hard all their lives, their parents worked hard, they\u2019re doing all the right things. . . . They go to church, they read the Bible, they have traditional families, and so on. They\u2019ve done everything the right way. All of the sudden the line is stalled. Up ahead of them, there are people leaping forward, which doesn\u2019t bother them because according to the doctrine, that\u2019s the American way. You work hard and you have merit, strange kind of merit, you get rewards. What bothers them is that the people behind them in the line, as they see it, are being pushed ahead of them by the federal government. By liberal elites and so forth. By liberal elites and the federal government. That they resent. The facts are different. There\u2019s no basis in fact, but you can understand the basis for the perception. That can be dealt with by serious activist organizing. Many of the people Hochschild was dealing with are committed environmentalists, but they hate the EPA. They want to destroy the Environment Protection Agency. The families are very interesting. Hochschild\u2019s working in an area which is sometimes called cancer alley. Everybody\u2019s dying from cancer from the chemical pollution plants. Nevertheless, they vote for a Congressman who wants to dismantle the EPA entirely."

    "input": "Do you see any examples of progressive Left organizing that really operate out of that Hochschild narrative and find a way to really connect with these communities in a credible way to these people?",
    "output": "The core of this, I think, which you\u2019ve mentioned several times, is revitalizing the labor movement. Reasons include scale, history, and so on, the ways people interact, gain understanding, and become committed to work together for common goals that will benefit all. Labor has always been and will continue to be pretty much in the forefront of any progressive activities, just as it has been in the past. It\u2019s been severely damaged by corporate and government programs going back to right after the Second World War, but escalating during the Reagan and Clinton period, the neoliberal period. It can be revitalized. These are not just people living in the bayous. They\u2019re living 2 miles away from us. There are things to be done. Just to take one example, a couple of years ago in a Boston suburb, Taunton, Mass., some multi-national decided to close down a factory. It was a factory producing specialized parts for airplanes. The factory was reasonably profitable, but it wasn\u2019t making enough profit for the bankers that run the multi-national, so they decided to close it down. The union and the workforce offered to buy it and run it themselves. It could have been run and been profitable. If they had had popular support, community support, activist support, they might have been able to work that out. That\u2019s been done. Gar Alperovitz has documented that in Ohio... It\u2019s done, but this is a case right here in Boston. The things that Gar Alperovitz is doing, that are going on right now, these are indications of what could be done much more broadly. It could be done right here. It could be done on a mass scale. Go back to the financial crisis, really a housing bubble that burst and led to the financial crisis. At one point, the government, federal government, had basically nationalized the auto industry. Almost. There were choices at that point. If there had been a Left functioning, it could have influenced those choices. There was not, so it didn\u2019t influence them. You mean by a Left functioning, do you mean a more active labor, popular community-based... Popular activist movements. There were choices that could have been made. One choice, the one that was taken, was to pay off the owners and managers, reconstitute the industry and hand it back to the former owners or other people much like them and have it go back to its old activities. That\u2019s the course that was taken. An alternative course would have been to have handed the industry over to the stakeholders, the workforce and the community. They\u2019d need some support but no more than . . . probably less than what was paid off to the companies. Instead of having them produce cars, have them own and run and manage it and produce what the country needs, which is not more cars. Drive through Boston and you see that\u2019s not what the country needs. What we need is some reasonable system of mass transportation, which goes right to the environmental problem and many others. Even just the simple comfort of not sitting in a traffic jam all day in getting where you want to go. That would have been an alternative. Was it feasible? It would have been feasible if there were an organized activist Left, just as in the Taunton case nearby. Those are directions in which activism can go. They can have massive effect on the economy, on the society, on the nature of the workforce, on what they perceive as real hope and change. Things like that can happen almost every day. When you talk about this organized Left community as a front that\u2019s...do you have a more concrete image of what that looks like? Does it mean environmental movements and anti-racist movements becoming part of a unified... All of that, but even more than that. It can also become a serious independent party. In the U.S. system, which happens to be very regressive by comparative standards, it\u2019s very hard for an independent party to enter the political system, but it\u2019s not impossible. If an authentic independent political party would develop, it could become an electoral alternative. That means a party that doesn\u2019t just show up every 4 years and say, I have a candidate for the election. It means starting at the local levels. School boards, town meetings, state legislatures, House of Representatives, all the way up. In some of these House of Representatives districts, a very small amount of money is enough to win the election. Many of them run unopposed. State legislature is the same."

    "input": "In your view, just in terms of your personal view, is that a realistic possibility? Could Sanders, Warren, some of these new people who tried to get Pelosi out and dig in with labor, is this worth doing in your view?",
    "output": "It\u2019s worth doing and it\u2019s not an alternative to trying to develop an independent party. Both should be done. They could even cooperate. This is only one stream. This should be going on alongside many other activist efforts. For example, the effort, say, to get to worker ownership in Taunton or at a large-scale level to shift the whole auto industry toward what it ought to be, which could have been done had there been some kind of activist Left like we\u2019re talking about. I think there\u2019s a basis for developing that. I think you\u2019re saying there\u2019s a very pluralistic set of possibilities for the communities we\u2019re talking about. healthy Left would be one in which individuals, of course, follow what they\u2019re good at, what makes sense to them, what fits into their life, and so on. You have to make choices. You can\u2019t do everything. Each of those individuals should recognize that the many other choices are parallel and mutually supportive, and we can get together and... You want to build connections among these different organizations and different communities. In the past that has often been built around the labor movement. If the labor movement can be revitalized, that can happen again. It doesn\u2019t have to be just labor, but that should be a central part. You brought up Trump and the neo-fascist trend we\u2019re seeing across the world, across Europe, and so forth. You know a lot about fascism and the problems with popular fronts and so forth. Do you see unification emerging...extinction itself ought to be bringing people together because it\u2019s the biggest crisis ever faced. The rising of Trump and his contribution to all these threatening things might unify people as well. Could happen. First of all, in Europe, there are progressive alternatives developing just as there are here. Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s DiEM25 initiative, Podemos in Spain. Corbyn in the UK... New party, more visionary party... Some of it is parties, some organizations . . . seeking to reverse the undermining of democracy in Europe and build it. Not to destroy the European union like Brexit, but to try to rebuild a democratic European union, save what was good and important in it. That could become an important movement. There are many things developing. They should develop in an integrated fashion. In fact, there are other possible alliances. The Right wing in Europe, many elements of it, are opposed to the increasing confrontation with Russia, on the Russian border. That\u2019s fine. Trump is saying, let\u2019s reduce tensions. Fine. We should be working for that. All of these are alliances of human beings, whatever their politics, whatever their religious beliefs, whatever it may be, with the interest in preserving human life on earth. Those interactions should be pursued and can lead to other ones. They don\u2019t end there. Ralph Nader has made very strongly the case, that there are ways that these communities can find common ground. They do. There are people like Thomas Frank who have argued the cultural differences are so profound, the religious differences are so profound, that he finds this very problematic. Then there are other people like Hochschild and a lot of other writers, like Nader, people who are saying if we do this in a way that we bring people in direct contact with each other... With common interests. For example, take the people that Hochschild was studying on the bayou, who are environmentalists, committed environmentalists, no reason why they can\u2019t work together with environmentalists who say, \u201cLook, let\u2019s get regulations that really work. Not just against your fishing, but against your chemical companies.\u201d That\u2019s a common basis. It happens that many of them regard the Bible as a much more authentic source of information than science, but that\u2019s not graven in stone either. That can be changed. In fact, in the Evangelical community, there have been very progressive elements. Take the Central America solidarity movements. They were very significant. This is probably the first time in history that in the country that was responsible for the atrocities, individuals were going to help the victims. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever happened before. Nobody ever dreamt of going to a Vietnamese village to live with the villagers, to help them, to provide a white face, which is a little protection. It just never occurred to anyone. This happened with tens of thousands of people during the Central America solidarity period. Many of them were Evangelical. I remember talking in Evangelical churches in the Midwest where people not only had direct experience, but knew more about what was going on than academics did. They were directly involved. For example, after the election in Nicaragua, the right-wing election, many of them stayed. Others gave up and left, but they stayed. There\u2019s plenty of opportunities. These are also Evangelical Christians. Organize in churches, organize in communities. How did the Central America solidarity movements develop? People totally secular and Left like me were perfectly capable of working together with Evangelical Christians on concrete things, like helping communities protect themselves from criminal atrocities, state crimes, and so on."

There was real interaction, very constructive interaction between Northern college students and deeply impoverished repressed Black areas in the rural South.

You\u2019re saying, that\u2019s in a way a metaphor for what has... It can be done. There\u2019s no point arguing that it can\u2019t be done because the cultural differences are too great. Press forward as far as you can. My guess is one will find that the cultural differences, though they\u2019ll remain (why shouldn\u2019t they?) can be overcome by common concerns and interests. Trump may end up simply crushing with brute repression many of the Left forces. I don\u2019t see any reason to expect real neo-fascism. Could happen, but I don\u2019t think the indications are strong. We shouldn\u2019t be frightened of it. We should proceed with the opportunities we have which are considerable. Others can be brought in as well. The repressive forces themselves can be undermined. That\u2019s happened often. They have shared interests in many ways. If demonstrations and other activities are taken with an eye toward reaching out to those who are unsympathetic and bringing them in, I think a lot of progress can be made."

Trump\u2019s position is maybe rhetorically more extreme, but not fundamentally different from the Party. That\u2019s a big educational and organizing opportunity for the Left. The United States is off the spectrum, global spectrum on this issue in some respects, which can be dealt with. Almost half the population thinks there can\u2019t be a climate change problem because of the Second Coming within a couple decades. That is not dealt with by demonstrations, but by sympathetic interactions. I like the spirit of what you\u2019ve been arguing, which is very invitational.

You\u2019ve offered a very realistic but hopeful view of how to invite conversation and dialog and build connections to the whole country. Pursue the opportunities that exist. There are many of them. We don\u2019t know how far they can reach. There\u2019s no point mourning the bad things that happen. Find the things that can be done. Many of them with international connections, because there are similar problems. Many of them integrating people who seem to be on opposite sides of the divide, but really have common interests. Those could be extricated and pursued. Wonderful. I feel very much in sympathy with the spirit of invitation and dialog and connection and unity. I think it\u2019s the way...it\u2019s at the heart of the progressive Left agenda in some way. We haven\u2019t done it very well very often, but it\u2019s consistent with our core values. That\u2019s what we should be pursuing. That\u2019s what we should be doing. Thank you very much, Noam."

    "output": "I think the withdrawal will have practically no effect on US imperial policy. The current commentary on Afghanistan is almost entirely about what the war cost us. You find virtually nothing about what it cost Afghans. There are a few interesting articles showing that what the press understood very well twenty years ago, but were ridiculing, was in fact correct: there was no reasonable basis for the war in the first place. Osama bin Laden was only a suspect when the United States started bombing Afghanistan. If there\u2019s a suspect whom you want to apprehend, you carry out a small police operation. They could\u2019ve apprehended him, then worked to discover if he was actually responsible, which they didn\u2019t know. In fact, that was conceded eight months later. Robert Muller, head of the FBI, gave his first extensive press conference in which he said \u2014 after probably the most intensive investigation in the world \u2014 that we assume al-Qaeda and Bin Laden were responsible for 9/11, but we haven\u2019t been able to establish it yet. First you bomb, then you check to see if there was any reason. We now know that the Taliban were willing to surrender in 2001. But defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld proudlyannounced, \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate surrenders.\u201d The Taliban\u2019s proposed terms were that their leading figures be allowed to live in dignity. Why not? They hadn\u2019t done anything. The story was that they had harbored terrorists. Don\u2019t we do that? We harbor some of the worst war criminals in modern times \u2014 including people who are recognized to be terrorists, like Orlando Bosch andLuis Posada, who were allowed to live happily in Florida under US protection. There\u2019s no question. Nobody doubted they were terrorists. They were responsible for, among other things, thebombingof a Cubana airliner in which seventy-three people were killed. It\u2019s called terrorism if someone else does it. If we do it, it\u2019s fun and games. So there was no reason not to allow the Taliban to live in dignity \u2014 except for what was explained by the most prominent figure of the anti-Taliban Afghan resistance, Abdul Haq. Hewas interviewedby a highly regarded Middle East/Central Asia specialist, Anatol Lieven, in the British press. Haq bitterly condemned the invasion, as did other Afghan anti-Taliban activists. Hesaid, \u201cThe US is trying to show its muscle, score a victory and scare everyone in the world. They don\u2019t care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many people we will lose.\u201d Abdul Haq was killed by the Taliban soon thereafter. Anybody who shared Haq\u2019s view at the time was either ignored or ridiculed by the mainstream press. Now they\u2019re conceding that it was correct. Is this the end of the empire? No. All that\u2019s resulted is the acknowledgment that the War in Afghanistan was too costly to us, so we\u2019ll do things differently going forward. AT:You\u2019ve mentioned elsewhere that the framework people use to understand the withdrawal from Afghanistan is comparing the cost of the war to potential domestic spending on social welfare programs or other things that could benefit Americans. You\u2019ve pointed out that this is a moral issue, and that we owe Afghans after decades of terror."

    "output": "You\u2019re right about the framework. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s discussed. And it\u2019s true that crazy war spending in general \u2014$753 billionPentagon budget \u2014 is, first of all, endangering us very much. It\u2019s also taking away resources that are badly needed for other purposes. That\u2019s apart from Afghanistan, but the point is correct. Yes, we\u2019re responsible for doing something to help Afghanistan escape from the wreckage for which we are substantially responsible. There are concrete things we could do. For example, we should be admitting Afghan refugees \u2014 and without bureaucratic hassles. They should be treated decently. The second thing we should do is end this disgraceful program of putting sanctions on Afghanistan. I don\u2019t like the Taliban. You don\u2019t like them. But that\u2019s no reason to punish Afghans. They need the humanitarian aid badly. It\u2019s Afghan people who are starving \u2014 not the Taliban leaders.Sanctionsin general punish the population and not their leadership. That was true of the sanctions on Iraq, Iran, Cuba, and Venezuela, too. We know the actual reasons for sanctioning. They\u2019re sometimes even announced. In the case of Cuba during the 1960s, the United States recognized that Castro was very popular. They thought that the only way to overthrow his government was by fomenting discontent. The idea was to make life so impossible that people would topple the government. Of course, it wasn\u2019t the only way: John F. Kennedy also launched a major terrorist war, which practically brought the world to nuclear disaster in 1962. Sanctions on Cuba intensified under Bill Clinton. When Cuba was in a desperate position after the Russians pulled out, Clinton outflanked George H. W. Bush from the right to increase the sanctions so as to starve the population and beat them into submission so they\u2019ll overthrow the government. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on now. Incidentally, the United States is the only country that could impose such sanctions. These are third-party sanctions. Everyone has to obey them, or else they get tossed out of the international financial system. Only the United States has the capacity to do that, and it\u2019s a major form of state terrorism. The case of Afghanistan is another one. We should also unblock the International Monetary Fund and World Bank funding. Those institutions are blocking funding, of course, under US pressure. That should be stopped. We should make every possibility for the Taliban and the population to solve their own problems. There were better solutions available in the late 1980s. For example, now everybody\u2019s concerned with women\u2019s rights. How wonderful and touching. What happened in the late 1980s when the Russians had their regime in place, the Najibullah regime, which was protecting women\u2019s rights? Women were going to university and wearing whatever clothes they wanted. They did have problems: the problems were the US-backed Islamic maniacs like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who were throwing acid in the faces of women with the wrong clothes. Very credible people wrote articles about this and sent them to US journals that wouldn\u2019t publish them because it was a Russian-run regime. JP:As you mentioned, when Biden announced the withdrawal of troops, there was suddenly this wave of media commentary talking about Afghan women and girls and what fate they might face under the Taliban. If there\u2019s anything the last few decades have taught us, it\u2019s that we should be suspicious of \u201chumanitarian intervention.\u201d Meanwhile, a lot of progressives are invoking the Pottery Barn rule of \u201cyou break it, you buy it.\u201d They don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s right for the United States to create this disaster in Afghanistan and then just pack up and leave. In light of all this commentary, I\u2019m wondering if there are other humanitarian projects that you think progressives should be supporting \u2014 aside from ending sanctions and admitting more refugees \u2014 that don\u2019t fall into this trap of continuing the intervention. I\u2019m sure there are good people on the ground in Afghanistan who really are committed to human rights. But they\u2019re not the policymakers. The first step in humanitarian intervention is to stop destroying. If we can stop destroying, terrorizing, and using our muscle to intimidate everyone, that\u2019ll be a big step forward. If we get that far, then we can start thinking about doing things of value. Take George W. Bush, who was responsible for the invasion of Afghanistan and invasion of Iraq that followed later \u2014 millions of people killed, countries destroyed, the whole region wrecked through ethnic conflict that didn\u2019t exist before. But Bush did some good things. His health programs in Africa, for example, were quite helpful. That\u2019s humanitarian intervention. We could carry out a humanitarian program right now by making vaccines available to Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia. Biden has at least taken some small steps in that direction. But not the major steps called for by thePeople\u2019s Vaccinemovement, like freeing up patents from exorbitant intellectual property rights. Those rights not only patent the product but also the process. That\u2019s something new introduced by Bill Clinton and other neoliberal fanatics in the World Trade Organization. It\u2019s a radical violation of free trade that never existed in the past. And it\u2019s all in service of more profits for drug companies. Well, we can eliminate that and allow other countries to manufacture the vaccines, which were mostly created on public funding anyway."

Israel was the only country that voted with the United States because it\u2019s a client state. Nobody else did. Does that even get reported?",
    "output": "The blockade is about punishing Cuba for standing up to us \u2014 what the State Department, back in the \u201960s, called \u201csuccessful defiance.\u201d The United States won\u2019t let anybody get away with that, so they\u2019ll make up all sorts of stories about human rights. There are human rights abuses in Cuba \u2014 in fact, some of the worst in the hemisphere. They\u2019re taking place in the southeast corner of Cuba in a place called Guantanamo Bay, which the United States took at gunpoint and refuses to give back. What happens atGuantanamoare maybe the worst human-rights violations in the hemisphere. Let\u2019s stop violating human rights viciously in places we\u2019ve stolen from Cuba at gunpoint and maintained because it holds a major port. That\u2019d be humanitarian intervention. You can look around the world and find endless things like that. Actual humanitarian intervention? It barely exists. It\u2019s very hard to find an authentic case of humanitarian intervention. Of course, every action by a great power is called \u201chumanitarian.\u201d That\u2019s universal. When Adolf Hitler invaded Poland, it was to protect people from the wild terror of the Poles. If we had records from Attila the Hun, he\u2019d probably be humanitarian. AT:You mention George W. Bush. He\u2019s been rehabilitated in the eyes of the liberal establishment. Bush started out as evil incarnate, rushing us into two wars we had no business starting. Then he was turned into kind of a bumbling oaf who ran interference for Dick Cheney, the real mastermind behind the scenes.

Can you talk about how and why the media whitewashes its own recent history?",
    "output": "What about Henry Kissinger? He\u2019s honored despite being one of the worst war criminals in modern history. In 1970, Kissinger loyally followed his master Richard Nixon and transmitted orders of a kind that I don\u2019t think have ever appeared in the historical record. Orders to the American air forcesaid, \u201cMassive bombing campaign in Cambodia . . . Anything that flies against anything that moves.\u201d See if you can find an analog to that in the historical record \u2014 among the Nazis, among anyone. And it wasn\u2019t just words. It led to a horrendous, horrific bombing campaign. Go to India. Henry Kissinger supported the Pakistani destruction of East Bengal. A huge number of people were killed. Maybe a million or more. And Kissinger threatened India with punishment if they dared to try to stop the slaughter. What were the reasons? Kissinger had a planned photo op with Mao Zedong in China. They were going to meet, shake hands, and announce detente. But Kissinger had to go through Pakistan to get there. And all this slaughter was undermining his photo op. What about Chile? Kissinger was the point man pressing hard for the overthrow of the Salvador Allende government. He did so on two tracks: one track was just violence \u2014 a military coup. Then there was a soft track: \u201cmake the economy scream.\u201d Make it impossible for people to live. Well, they finally got what they wanted and, in 1973, instituted a vicious dictatorship, which, incidentally, wasthe first 9/11. What happened in 2001 was the second 9/11. The first one was much worse, by any measure. Translated to per-capita terms, it would be as if our 9/11 had seen 30,000 people killed outright with another 500,000 tortured. A government was overthrown, a vicious dictatorship was instituted, and terror, torture, and horrors abounded. And the United States celebrated. It poured funds in to help the new dictatorship. Various international agencies that had been withholding funds from Allende did the same. The neoliberals, who have been running the world for the past forty years, loved it. They moved in to advise the new government. Friedrich Hayek, the moral leader of neoliberalism, visited and said he was impressed by the freedom under Augusto Pinochet and said he couldn\u2019t find a single person in Chile who didn\u2019t think there was more freedom under the Pinochet dictatorship than under Allende. Somehow he couldn\u2019t hear the cries of anguish fromVia Grimaldiand other torture chambers. That was the reaction to the first 9/11. I\u2019m sure there are jihadis who celebrated the second 9/11. We think they\u2019re terrible, but we\u2019re much worse. Did anybody talk aboutthaton the anniversary of 9/11? The first 9/11 was much worse than what happened in September 2001. If you want to know what we can do, we can begin by educating ourselves. Just take this notion of \u201cforever wars\u201d that\u2019s being bandied about.Biden ended the forever wars. When did the forever wars start? 1783. That\u2019s when the British pulled out. They had prevented the colonists from invading what was called \u201cIndian Country\u201d: the Indian Nations to the west of the Appalachian Mountains. The British had blocked that expansion, and the colonists weren\u2019t having it \u2014 certainly not people like George Washington, who was a major land speculator and desperately wanted to exterminate the Indians, who he vowed to make disappear. Immediately, the colonists launched murderous, brutal wars against the Indian Nations. Extermination, dispersal, treaties broken \u2014 I mean, every horror you can think of. They knew what they were doing. The leading figure \u2014 the intellectual architect \u2014 of Manifest Destiny, John Quincy Adams, in his later yearslamentedthe fate of the \u201chapless race . . . which we are exterminating with such merciless and perfidious cruelty.\u201d That was long after his own major contributions to the process. And that was before the worst of it. The crimes went on to California, where they were truly genocidal. There\u2019s a famousdiplomatic historyof the United States by Thomas Bailey, who discusses this. He says it was defensive. He says that, after the colonists got their freedom, they turned to the task of \u201cfelling trees and Indians\u201d and territorial expansion. They picked up half of Mexico in the process and robbed Hawaii from its natives. The United States has been at war practically every year since it was founded. And there were victims. Why not ask them about the costs? Nobody will, I don\u2019t think. We only seem to care about the forever wars that cost us too much."

But what about the people who we\u2019ve been exterminating, attacking, and destroying for 250 years, ever since the country was founded?",
    "output": "There\u2019s anarticlein theNew York Timesby a nice person, Samuel Moyn, about how the United States is turning toward more humanitarian wars. He says they\u2019re still terrible, but they\u2019re more humanitarian than before. And he gives an example: George H. W. Bush\u2019s invasion of Kuwait. He says it was much more humanitarian than earlier wars. Was it? As Iraq\u2019s peasant conscripts were retreating from Kuwait, the American army used bulldozers to shovel them into ditches and suffocate them so they couldn\u2019t. The Air Force completely destroyed undefended infrastructure throughout Iraq. This was, incidentally, a war that also never had to be fought. There were plenty of options for diplomatic settlement. But the press refused to report them, and the US government just dismissed them. The war could\u2019ve been avoided. In fact, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was not all that different from the US invasion of Panama a couple months earlier. That\u2019s gone from history. Did you see it written about at theNew York Times? No. The people who mentioned it were simply ridiculed and denounced as unpatriotic. Nothing\u2019s changed. Same institutions, same doctrines, same beliefs. Of course, the world is somewhat different. One difference is the population. To the extent that today\u2019s wars are more humanitarian, that\u2019s thanks to people like you. It\u2019s coming from people on the ground. The country has become more civilized as a result of the activism of the 1960s. And there\u2019s plenty of evidence for that, though it doesn\u2019t get discussed. It\u2019s not the right story. Take theCentral American wars. Horrible atrocities. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed. There was torture, massacres \u2014 everything you can think of. But there were things the United States couldn\u2019t do. It couldn\u2019t do what John F. Kennedy could do in South Vietnam twenty years earlier. They tried, but they couldn\u2019t do it. There was simply too much opposition here. When he came into office, Ronald Reagan tried to duplicate what Kennedy had done twenty years earlier. There was an immediate backlash from the population. They weren\u2019t accepting that anymore. What happened in Central America was something totally new in the entire history of imperialism. It was the first time ever that people in the aggressor country didn\u2019t just protest but went to live with the victims. I visited churches in Middle America where people knew more about Central America than the academics, because they were working there. It\u2019s never happened. Nobody in France went to live in an Algerian village. Nobody in the United States went to live in a Vietnamese village. This was unheard of. And it changed what the US government can do. Articles by academics in professional journals didn\u2019t do it; activists on the ground did. They can make a difference now, too. That\u2019s what changes the world."

When I think back to the antiwar movement that sprang up after Afghanistan, and particularly in the lead-up to Iraq, it didn\u2019t stop or slow either war. But is there still something we can take away from the antiwar movement of that period?",
    "output": "The first thing they should learn is how effective they were. The common view is that we failed. That\u2019s not true. We recently learned, from high-level German sources, that the Bush administration was planning to usenuclear weaponsin Afghanistan. But they couldn\u2019t do that because the US population wouldn\u2019t tolerate it. The Iraq War also had something new in the history of imperialism. There were massive protests, which you participated in, before the war was officially launched. In fact, the war had been going on for a long time \u2014 back to Bill Clinton bombing Iraq in 1998 \u2014 but it was officially launched in March 2003. The day before, my students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology demanded that class be canceled so that we could all participate in the mass demonstrations before the war was officially declared. That kind of thing has never happened in the history of imperialism. While what happened in Iraq was bad enough, it could\u2019ve been a lot worse. If Rumsfeld, Cheney, and the rest of them were unleashed, we don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened. But they were constrained by public opposition on the ground. That\u2019s happened over and over. It doesn\u2019t get written about, it\u2019s the wrong story. But it\u2019s a story we should recognize. So I don\u2019t think the antiwar movement was ineffective. I think it was very effective. It\u2019s a real factor that led to the very limited reduction in violence, terror, destruction that we see. The lesson is: continue it harder. Take the very serious threat of nuclear weapons, which mounted significantly under Donald Trump. So far, Biden is pursuing the same policies. Well, let\u2019s look back. In the early 1980s, there were huge public demonstrations condemning the placement of short-distance missiles in West Germany. Those missiles could reach Moscow within ten minutes. There were similar protests against them in Europe, which were also enormous. That had an effect. It led Reagan to accept Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s offers for establishing the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. That was an enormous step toward peace. It reduced significantly threats that could\u2019ve easily led to nuclear war. As part of his general wrecking-ball approach, destroying everything with any value, Trump dismantled the treaty. Immediately after, on the anniversary of Hiroshima Day, he launched missiles that violate the treaty. The demonstrations of the early \u201980s put some kind of limit on this. That\u2019s a lesson, too. They can take place now and help stop the race to disaster that\u2019s underway. Same with climate destruction. Pressure from the population \u2014 young people, mostly \u2014 has pressured Biden to formally endorse programs that aren\u2019t too bad. They\u2019re ultimately insufficient, but nonetheless much better than anything that appeared before. On August 9, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released itslatest report. It\u2019s very grim and didn\u2019t get anywhere near adequate coverage [in the United States]. That was on a Monday. What happened Wednesday? On Wednesday, Biden issued anappealto OPEC \u2014 the oil cartel \u2014 to increase production because he wants gas prices to decline in the United States to improve his electoral prospects. That\u2019s why activism on the ground makes a difference.Sunrise Movementactivists took over Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office. They gotsupportfrom Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, so they didn\u2019t just get thrown out. That led to an actual resolution in Congress. It\u2019s on the floor. Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey have aresolution, which has a very sensible program that would deal effectively with the severe threat of environmental destruction. It\u2019s a resolution, but you have to get beyond a resolution to a legislation. That\u2019s going to take a lot of work. Republicans, of course, will be 100 percent opposed. Their commitment at this point is to slavishly serve the corporate sector and shine Trump\u2019s boots so that the crowds he has organized don\u2019t go after them. That\u2019s the Republican Party. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens to the country or the world. They\u2019re 100 percent opposed, and there can be no deviation. Then there are a few Democrats who can block anything. We know who they are. Well, that means work."

If we don\u2019t take care of the climate problem in a couple of decades, we\u2019ll pass tipping points. And Republicans are probably going to get back into power next year, or maybe in 2024.

And the two are closely linked \u2014 language is the instrument of thought and the means for formulating thought in our mind, sometimes externalizing at others. These two capacities seem to have emerged together probably about the same time as Homo sapiens. They\u2019re common to all humans, apart from severe pathology. And there are no analogues in the animal world. In fact, there may not be any anywhere, as far as we know."

We are somehow capable of constructing in our minds an unbounded array of meaningful expressions. Mostly, it happens beyond consciousness. Sometimes, it emerges to consciousness. We can use these in a way which is appropriate to situations and constantly in new ways, often which are new in the history of the language in our own history. This creative character through the centuries has been connected speculatively, but not absurdly, to a fundamental instinct for freedom, which is part of our essential nature \u2014 resistance to domination and control by illegitimate authorities, a fundamental element of human nature, maybe part of the same creative capacity, which shows up very strikingly in our normal use of language."

    "output": "Anarchism, the way I understand it, is pretty close to truism. And I think everybody, if they think about it, will accept at least this much. We begin with assuming that any structure of authority and domination has to justify itself. It\u2019s not self-justifying. It has a burden of proof. It has to show that it\u2019s legitimate. If you\u2019re taking a walk with your kid, and the kid runs into the street, and you grab their arm and pull them back, that\u2019s an exercise of authority. But it\u2019s legitimate. You can have a justification, and there are such cases where there is justification. But if you look closely, most of them do not. Most of them are what David Hume, Edward Bernays, Walter Lippmann, Adam Smith and others have been talking about over the centuries. Namely, illegitimate authority.

    "output": "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a trade-off if it\u2019s done in a free democratic society. A free society can select people to have administrative and other authority to take over parts of the concern for the common good. And they can be recalled, but they\u2019re under popular control. They\u2019re not there because their grandfather built railroads or because they managed to finesse the market so that they ended up with a ton of money. They\u2019re not there for that reason. They\u2019re there because they\u2019re delegated under popular authority, under recall, not any amount of structure of hierarchy and domination you want. You have this in, for example, worker-controlled enterprises, some of them huge. Take Mondragon, the largest of them, which has been around for about 60 years in Northern Spain \u2014 worker-owned, worker-managed, huge conglomerate, industrial production, banks, housing, hospitals, everything. It\u2019s not perfect by any means, but it\u2019s based on the fundamental principle of popular democratic control and authorization to carry out managerial functions when needed. And just about any decently functioning research lab in a university works pretty much the same way. Maybe a department chair is chosen to handle the administrative work. If the faculty doesn\u2019t like them, you pick somebody else. These are certainly possible structures of all kinds. They don\u2019t undermine the possibility of organization. In fact, anarchist society should be highly organized, but under popular control of a free, informed community, which can interact without illegitimate forces controlling them."

But it would be under popular supervision, recall if necessary and constant interaction. So, I think there should be participation at all points. Now, take your own example: distributing a vaccine. People should have some say in this. How do we want it to be done? If somebody refuses to accept the vaccine, what should we do about it? That\u2019s a live problem right now. Almost half of Republicans are going to refuse to accept the vaccine. What that says is we\u2019ll never get out of the Covid crisis because we\u2019ll never get a level of immunity which will make it kind of like flu, maybe you get a shot every year.

Well, those are problems that the community has to decide on. Suppose somebody says, \u201cI\u2019m not going to obey traffic laws, I don\u2019t like them. I\u2019m going to run through red lights and drive on the left side of the road. I want to be free.\u201d Well, I have to make decisions about that. Saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to wear a mask\u201d is not very different from that. It says, \u201cI\u2019m going to go out to the shopping mall and if I infect you, it\u2019s your problem.\u201d Communities are going to have to make decisions about things like this."

I\u2019ve seen you talk about it in an interestingly optimistic way, that if you could harness the right politics around it, automation could be a way toward a better, more economically dignified future for people. How do you think about automation and its role in the future of the economy?",
    "output": "Any on-Earth boring, destructive, dangerous work should be automated to the extent possible. That frees people up to do better work, more creative work, more fulfilling work, safer work. So, that\u2019s all to the good. How automation takes place is a matter of social and economic policy. It can take place in many ways. Let me just mention one important careful study, which showed what the choices are, by a former colleague of mine \u2014 the fine historian of technology David Noble, who unfortunately died a couple of years ago. His major work was on the machine tool industry, the core of much of modern industrial capitalism. By the 1950s, the machine tool industry was beginning to be automated. Numerical processing was coming in. Computers were coming in, ways of potentially changing the machine tool industry using the new tools were coming along. There were two ways to do it. Both ways were experimented with. One way, de-skilled machinists replaced skilled machinists, first of all, by automation, but also by turning the people themselves into robots, who just followed orders and so on. That was one way. The other way to do it was to put more power into the hands of skilled machinists, still using the same technology. As Mr. Noble shows pretty convincingly, there was no economic reason to pick the first way. It was picked, it was picked \u2014 that\u2019s the way it was picked, but for power reasons. The ownership management class wants to de-skill people, wants to turn them into subordinate subjects, not independent agents and actors. So, they pick the mode of automation which de-skilled machinists \u2014 still around, but not skilled \u2014 and turn them into servants, rather than controllers and actors. That happens all the time."

    "output": "Well, you can predict with confidence that it won\u2019t be used. Because if it is being used, nobody\u2019s going to be around to care about it. So, nobody will show you that you were wrong. No, I\u2019m exaggerating. That\u2019s a nuclear conflict between major nuclear powers. India and Pakistan could have a nuclear war, which would probably wipe out South Asia, but people would survive elsewhere. If there\u2019s a nuclear war between China and the United States or China and Russia, it\u2019s essentially saying everything is over. I mean, there will be survival, but nobody would want to live in a world of the kind that would survive. There is an international treaty \u2014 just was accepted by the U.N. General Assembly a couple of months ago, the Treaty on Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Prohibition, that means no manufacturing them, no storing them. Prohibition, get rid of them. None of the nuclear states joined the agreement, unfortunately. But if the U.S. wants to demonstrate this leadership role that American intellectuals like to talk about, OK, here\u2019s a way to do it. Let\u2019s take the lead in making efforts to move toward accepting the Treaty on Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. I mean, I should say that\u2019s not an extreme position. It\u2019s been advocated by people like Henry Kissinger; George Shultz, late Secretary of State under Reagan; Sam Nunn; people who\u2019ve been right at the heart of the nuclear weapon system. They understand that you can\u2019t have a nuclear war. And we\u2019ve got to make moves toward eliminating. There\u2019s another way to do it, a very significant way \u2014 establish nuclear weapon free zones around the world. Doesn\u2019t end the problem, but it limits it.

Polychroniou: A year ago, on January 6, 2021, a mob of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters broke into the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to block certification of the electoral votes \u2014 a routine procedure following a presidential election \u2014 that would have formalized Joe Biden\u2019s victory. The Capitol building had been breached on a few occasions in the past, but this was the first time in the history of the country that an assault on democracy was actually incited by an outgoing president. In fact, months later, former President Trump would go so far as to condemn the criminal prosecution of those who took part in the Capitol attack that day even though he had denounced the insurrection after he had been impeached over it. From your perspective, Noam, how should we understand what happened on January 6, 2021?",
    "output": "Participants in the assault on the Capitol doubtless had varying perceptions and motives, but were united in the effort to overthrow an elected government; in short, an attempted coup, by definition. It was furthermore an attempt that could have succeeded if a few prominent Republican figures had changed their stance and gone along with the coup attempt, and if the military command had made different decisions. Trump was making every effort to facilitate the coup, which would surely have been applauded by a large majority of Republican voters and by the Republican political leadership, which, with a few exceptions, grovels at his feet in a shameful display of cowardice. Implications for the future are all too clear. The Republican organization \u2014 it\u2019s hard to regard them any longer as an authentic political party \u2014 is now carefully laying the groundwork for success next time, whatever the electoral outcome may be. It\u2019s all completely in the open, not onlynotconcealed but in fact heralded with pride by its leaders. And regularly reported, so that no one who is interested enough to pay attention to the American political scene can miss it. To mention just the most recent discussion I\u2019ve seen, theAssociated Pressdescribes how the GOP is carrying out a \u201cslow-motion insurrection\u201d and has become \u201can anti-democratic force,\u201d something that has not happened before in American politics. A few weeks earlier, Barton Gellman outlined the plans in detail inTheAtlantic. There is no need to review the many well-known flaws of the formal democratic system: the radically undemocratic Senate, the enormous role of concentrated wealth and private power in determining electoral outcomes and legislation, the structural advantages provided to a traditionalist rural minority, and much else. But there are also broader issues. What was progressive in the 18th century is by now so antiquated that if the U.S. were to apply for membership in the European Union, it would probably be rejected as not satisfying democratic norms. That raises questions that merit more attention than they receive. With all due respect for the Founders, one question \u2014 raised by Thomas Jefferson in his own terms \u2014 is why we should revere the sentiments of a group of wealthy white male 18th-century slaveowners, particularly now that the amendment system has succumbed to the deep flaws of the formal political system. No less curious are the legal doctrines of originalism/textualism that call on us to decipher their pronouncements with little regard to social and economic conditions as a decisive guide to judicial action. Looking at our political culture from a distance, there is a lot that would seem passing strange. But even the tattered system that still survives is intolerable to GOP wreckers. Nothing is overlooked in their systematic assault on the fragile structure. Methods extend from \u201ctaking hold of the once-overlooked machinery of elections\u201d at the ground level, to passing laws to bar the \u201cwrong people\u201d from voting, to devising a legal framework to establish the principle that Republican legislatures can \u201clegally\u201d determine choice of electors, whatever the irrelevant public may choose. In the not-too-distant background are calls to \u201csave our country\u201d by force if necessary, where \u201cour country\u201d is a white supremacist Christian nationalist patriarchal society in which non-white folk can take part as long as they \u201cknow their place\u201d; not at the table. [White people\u2019s] fear of \u201closing our country\u201d is [in part a response to] demographic tendencies that are eroding white majorities, resisting even the radical gerrymandering that is imposed to amplify the structural advantages of the scattered conservative rural vote. Another threat to \u201cour country\u201d is that white supremacy is increasingly rejected, particularly by younger people, as is devotion to religious authority, even church membership. So while the charges of right-wing propagandists are largely fantasy and delusion, they have enough of a basis in reality to enflame those who see their familiar world of dominance disappearing before their eyes. And with the social order crumbling under the neoliberal assault, these fears can easily be manipulated by demagogues and opportunists \u2014 while their masters in the executive suites and mansions relish the opportunity to carry forward the highway robbery that they have engaged in for 40 years if future challenges can be beaten down, by state and private violence if necessary. That\u2019s a world that may not be remote, though it won\u2019t last long with the supreme climate denialists in charge. When Hungary, the current darling of the right, descends towards fascism, it\u2019s bad enough. If the U.S. does, long-term survival of human society is a dim prospect."

    "output": "It tells us that the limited political democracy that still exists is hanging by a delicate thread. If political institutions \u2014 more generally, intertwined socioeconomic-political institutions \u2014 can yield a President Trump, they are infected with profound malignancies. A moment\u2019s reflection shows that the malignancies are so profound that they are driving organized human society to suicide, and not in the distant future, with Trump and his acolytes and apologists enthusiastically in the lead. By now it takes real literary talent to exaggerate. What are these institutions? That\u2019s much too far-reaching an inquiry to undertake here, but there are some instructive highlights. The so-called Founders outlined clearly enough the kind of society they envisioned: \u201cthose who own the country ought to govern it\u201d and ensure that \u201cthe minority of the opulent are protected from the majority\u201d (John Jay, James Madison, respectively). Their model was England, where the reigning institutions had been described accurately a few years earlier by Adam Smith in words that bear repetition: The \u201cmasters of mankind,\u201d the merchants and manufacturers of England, are the \u201cprincipal architects\u201d of government policy and ensure that their own interests are \u201cmost peculiarly attended to\u201d no matter how \u201cgrievous\u201d the impact on others, including the people of England but also, much more severely, the victims of \u201cthe savage injustice of the Europeans,\u201d notably the people of India, then the richest country in the world, which England was robbing and despoiling for the benefit of the masters. Under the protection of the state they control, the masters can pursue their \u201cvile maxim\u201d: \u201cAll for ourselves and nothing for other people,\u201d the maxim of the feudal lords adopted by the masters of mankind who had been replacing them since the \u201cglorious revolution\u201d of the preceding century. The masters of mankind have always understood that free-market capitalism would destroy them and the societies they owned. Accordingly, they have always called for a powerful state to protect them from the ravages of the market, leaving the less fortunate exposed. That has been dramatically plain in the course of the \u201cbailout economy\u201d of the past 40 years of class war, masked under \u201cfree market\u201d rhetoric. These core features of the reigning state capitalist institutions have been exacerbated by the rot spreading from interwar Vienna, adopting the term \u201cneoliberalism\u201d in the international Walter Lippmann symposium in Paris in 1938, then in the Mont Pelerin Society. The ideas were implemented under almost perfect experimental conditions during Augusto Pinochet\u2019s murderous dictatorship in Chile, crashing the economy in half a dozen years, but no matter. By then, they had bigger game in sight: the global economy in the era of vigorous class war launched by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and carried forward by Bill Clinton and other successors, establishing more firmly the vile maxim and dismantling such troublesome impediments as a limited welfare system and labor unions. That\u2019s the kind of terrain in which a Trump can appear, though there are of course multiple factors of varied nature that interact."

Should we really be surprised? Have a look at the views of Republicans on other matters. For example, on whether humans werecreatedas they are today: about half of Republicans. Or on whether Muslims are seeking to impose Sharia law on the U.S.: 60 percent of Republicans who trustFox News. Or on a host of other pre-modern beliefs in which the U.S. (mostly Republicans) stands virtually alone among comparable societies."

    "output": "Election subversion is not merely a threat. It\u2019s happening in the \u201csoft coup\u201d that is underway right now. As is the drift toward a form of fascism. There is evidence that general attitudes of Trump voters on a range of issues are similar to those of European voters for far right parties with fascist origins. And these sectors are now a driving force in the GOP. There\u2019s also substantial evidence that this drift to the far right may be driven in part by blind loyalty to Trump. That seems to be the case on the most critical issue that humans have ever faced: environmental destruction. During Trump\u2019s years in office, Republican recognition of climate change as a \u201cserious issue,\u201d already shockingly low, declined by 20 percent, even as nature has been issuing dramatic warnings, loud and clear, that we are racing toward disaster. The phenomenon is deeply disturbing, and not without grim precedent. A century ago, Germany was at the peak of Western civilization, producing great contributions to the sciences and the arts. The Weimar Republic was regarded by political scientists as a model democracy. A few years later, Germans were worshipping Der F\u00fchrer and accepting the vilest lies, and acting on them. That included some of the most respected figures, like Martin Heidegger; I recall very well my shock when I started to read his 1935Introduction to Metaphysicswhen it appeared in English 60 years ago. And I\u2019m old enough to remember hearing similar atrocious thoughts as a child in the \u201830s, close to home. Sinclair Lewis\u2019s 1935 classic on how fascism might be implanted in America by Christian nationalists (It Can\u2019t Happen Here) was not mere fantasy when it appeared, and it\u2019s no surprise that it has been returning to the best-seller lists in the Trump era."

Do you think that the congressional select committee involved in this task will establish accountability for what happened on that infamous day? And if it does, what could be the political implications of such an outcome?",
    "output": "The Republican leadership has already neutralized the select committee by refusal to participate on acceptable terms, then by rejecting subpoenas \u2014 a sensible strategy to delay the proceedings by court proceedings until they can simply disband the committee, or even better, reshape it to pursuing their political enemies. That\u2019s the kind of tactic that Trump has used successfully throughout his career as a failed businessman, and it is second nature to corrupt politicians. That aside, the events of January 6 have been investigated so fully, and even visually presented so vividly, that nothing much of substance is likely to be revealed. Republican elites who want to portray the insurrection as an innocent picnic in the park, with some staged violence by antifa to make decent law-abiding citizens look bad, will persist no matter what is revealed. And though there is more to learn about the background, it is not likely to have much effect on what seems now a reasonably plausible picture. Suppose that the select committee were to come up with new and truly damning evidence about Trump\u2019s role or other high-level connivance in the coup attempt. The Rupert Murdoch-controlled mainstream media would have little difficulty in reshaping that as further proof that the \u201cDeep State,\u201d along with the \u201cCommie rats\u201d and \u201csadistic pedophiles\u201d who supposedly run the Democratic Party, have conspired to vilify the \u201cGreat Man.\u201d His adoring worshippers would probably be emboldened by this additional proof of the iniquity of the evil forces conniving at the \u201cGreat Replacement.\u201d Or whatever fabrication is contrived by those capable of converting critical race theory into an instrument for destroying the \u201cembattled white race,\u201d among other propaganda triumphs. My guess is that the committee\u2019s work will end up being a gift to the proto-fascist forces that are chipping away at what remains of formal democracy, much as the impeachment proceedings turned out to be. It\u2019s worth proceeding for the sake of history \u2014 assuming that there will be any history that will even care if the plan to establish lasting Republican rule succeeds. No exaggeration."

Polychroniou: Noam, Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week at a joint press conference with ally Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that peace talks have reached a \u201cdead end\u201d and that the invasion is proceeding as planned. In fact, he vowed that the war would continue until all goals that were set at the start of the invasion are completed. Does Putin not want peace in Ukraine? Is he really at war with NATO and the U.S.? If so, particularly given how dangerous the West\u2019s policy toward Russia has been so far, what can be done now to prevent an entire country from being potentially wiped off the map?",
    "output": "Before proceeding with this discussion, I\u2019d like to emphasize, once again, the most important point: Our prime concern should be to think through carefully what we can do to bring the criminal Russian invasion to a quick end and to save the Ukrainian victims from more horrors. There are, unfortunately, many who find heroic pronouncements to be more satisfying than this necessary task. Not a novelty in history, regrettably. As always, we should keep the prime issue clearly in mind, and act accordingly. Turning to your comment, the final question is by far the most important one; I\u2019ll return to the earlier ones. There are, basically, two ways for this war to end: a negotiated diplomatic settlement or destruction of one or the other side, either quickly or in prolonged agony. It won\u2019t be Russia that is destroyed. Uncontroversially, Russia has the capacity to obliterate Ukraine, and if Putin and his cohort are driven to the wall, in desperation they might use this capacity. That surely should be the expectation of those who portray Putin as a \u201cmadman\u201d immersed in delusions of romantic nationalism and wild global aspirations. That\u2019s clearly an experiment that no one wants to undertake \u2014 at least no one who has the slightest concern for Ukrainians. The qualification is unfortunately necessary. There are respected voices in the mainstream who simultaneously hold two views: (1) Putin is indeed a \u201cderanged madman\u201d who is capable of anything and might lash out wildly in revenge if backed to the wall; (2) \u201cUkraine must win. That is the only acceptable outcome.\u201d We can help Ukraine defeat Russia, they say, by providing advanced military equipment and training, and backing Putin to the wall. Those two positions can only be simultaneously held by people who care so little about the fate of Ukrainians that they are willing to try an experiment to see whether the \u201cderanged madman\u201d will slink away in defeat or will use the overwhelming force at his command to obliterate Ukraine. Either way, the advocates of these two views win. If Putin quietly accepts defeat, they win. If he obliterates Ukraine, they win: It will justify far harsher measures to punish Russia. It is of no little interest that such willingness to play games with the lives and fate of Ukrainians receives high praise, and is even considered a noble and courageous stance. Perhaps other words might come to mind. Putting aside the qualification \u2014 unfortunately necessary in this strange culture \u2014 the answer to the question posed seems clear enough: engage in serious diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. Of course, that\u2019s not the response for those whose prime goal is to punish Russia \u2014 to fight Russia to the last Ukrainian, as Ambassador Chas Freeman describes current U.S. policy, matters we have discussed. The basic framework for a diplomatic settlement has long been understood and has been reiterated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. First, neutralization of Ukraine, providing it with a status rather like Mexico or Austria. Second, putting off the matter of Crimea. Third, arrangements for a high level of autonomy for Donbass, perhaps within a federal arrangement, preferably to be settled in terms of an internationally run referendum. Official U.S. policy continues to reject all of this. High administration officials don\u2019t just concede that \u201cprior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States made no effort to address one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s most often stated top security concerns \u2014 the possibility of Ukraine\u2019s membership into NATO.\u201d They praise themselves for having taken this position, which may well have been a factor in impelling Putin to criminal aggression. And the U.S. continues to maintain this position now, thus standing in the way of a negotiated settlement along the lines Zelenskyy outlined, whatever the cost to Ukrainians. Can a settlement along those general lines still be achieved, as seemed likely before the Russian invasion? There is only one way to find out: to try. Ambassador Freeman is far from alone among informed Western analysts in chastising the U.S. government for having \u201cbeen absent [from diplomatic efforts] and, at worst, implicitly opposed\u201d to them with its actions and rhetoric. That, he continues, is \u201cthe opposite of statecraft and diplomacy\u201d and a bitter blow to Ukrainians by prolonging the conflict. Other respected analysts, such as Anatol Lieven, generally agree, recognizing that at the very least, \u201cThe U.S. has done nothing to facilitate diplomacy.\u201d Regrettably, rational voices, however respected, are at the margins of discussion, leaving the floor to those who want to punish Russia \u2014 to the last Ukrainian. At the press conference, Putin did appear to be joining the U.S. in preferring \u201cthe opposite of statecraft and diplomacy,\u201d though his remarks do not close off these options. If peace talks are now at a \u201cdead end,\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean that they cannot be resumed, at best with committed participation of the great powers, China and the U.S. China is rightly condemned for its unwillingness to facilitate \u201cstatecraft and diplomacy.\u201d The U.S. as usual is exempt from criticism in U.S. mainstream media and journals (though not completely), except for not providing more weapons to prolong the conflict or using other measures to punish Russians, the dominant concern, it appears. One measure the U.S. could use is proposed from the halls of Harvard Law School, at the supposed liberal extreme of opinion. Professor emeritus Laurence Tribe and law student Jeremy Lewin propose that President Joe Biden should follow the precedent set by George W. Bush in 2003, when he seized \u201cIraqi funds sitting in American banks, allocating the proceeds to aid the Iraqi people and to compensate victims of terrorism.\u201d Did President Bush do something else in 2003 \u201cto aid the Iraqi people\u201d? That annoying question would be raised only by those guilty of the sin of \u201cwhataboutism,\u201d one of the recent devices designed to bar any attention to our own actions and their consequences for today. The authors recognize that there are some problems in freezing funds that have been kept for security in New York banks. They bring up the freezing of Afghanistan\u2019s funds by the Biden administration, which was \u201ccontroversial, owing mostly to unsettled questions regarding court attachment of assets and allocating claims among dueling plaintiffs ... suits filed by the relatives of those killed or wounded on 9/11.\u201d Unmentioned, perhaps not controversial, is the plight of Afghan mothers watching their children starve because they cannot access their bank accounts to buy food in the markets, and more generally the fate of millions of Afghans facing starvation. Further comment bearing on President Bush\u2019s 2003 efforts \u201cto aid the Iraqi people\u201d is provided, inadvertently, by the leading foreign policy analyst ofThe New York Times, Thomas Friedman in his headline: \u201cHow Do We Deal With a Superpower Led by a War Criminal?\u201d Who could imagine that a superpower could be led by a war criminal in this enlightened day and age? A difficult dilemma to face, even to contemplate, in a country of pristine innocence like ours."

    "output": "Returning to the press conference, Putin did say that the invasion was proceeding as planned and would continue until the initial goals are achieved. If the consensus of Western military analysts and political elites is anywhere near accurate, that is Putin\u2019s way of acknowledging that the initial goals of quickly conquering Kiev and installing a puppet government had to be abandoned because of fierce and courageous Ukrainian resistance, exposing the Russian military as a paper tiger incapable even of conquering cities a few miles from its border that are defended by a mostly citizens army. The consensus of experts then draws a further conclusion: The U.S. and Europe must devote even greater resources to protecting themselves from the next onslaught of this rapacious military monster who is poised to launch an attack to overwhelm NATO and the U.S. The logic is overwhelming. According to the consensus, Russia is now revising its abandoned plans and concentrating on a major assault in the Donbass region, where some 15,000 people are reported to have been killed since the Maidan uprising in 2014. By whom? It should not be hard to determine with many Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) observers on the ground. It seems to me to go too far to conclude that Putin is aiming for war with NATO and the U.S., that is, mutual annihilation. I think he wants peace \u2014 on his terms. (What monster doesn\u2019t?) What these terms are we can only discover by trying to find out, through \u201cstatecraft and diplomacy.\u201d We cannot find out by refusing to engage in this option, refusing even to contemplate or discuss it. We cannot find out by carrying forward the official policy announced last September and reinforced in November, matters that we have discussed repeatedly: the official U.S. policy on Ukraine that is withheld from Americans by the \u201cfree press\u201d but surely studied very carefully by Russian intelligence, which has access to the White House website. Returning to the essential point, we should be doing what we can to bring the criminal aggression to an end and doing so in a way that will save Ukrainians from further suffering and even possible obliteration if Putin and his circle are driven to the wall with no way out. That calls for a popular movement that will press the U.S. to reverse its official policy and to join in diplomacy and statecraft. Punitive measures (sanctions, military support for Ukraine) might be justified if they contribute to this end, not if designed to punish Russians while prolonging the agony and threatening Ukraine with destruction, with unspeakable ramifications beyond."

Kremlin officials have rejected such claims as \u201clies,\u201d but have openly talked about relocating civilians trapped in Mariupol. If reports of forced civilian deportations from Mariupol to Russia are proven true, what would be the purpose of such reprehensible actions, and wouldn\u2019t they add to the list of Putin\u2019s war crimes?",
    "output": "They surely would add to the list, already quite long. And, fortunately, we will know a lot about these crimes. There already are extensive investigations of Russian war crimes underway, and despite technical difficulties, they will proceed. That, too, is normal. When enemies carry out crimes, a major industry is mobilized to reveal every tiny detail. As should be done. War crimes should not be concealed and forgotten. Regrettably, that is the near-universal practice in the U.S. A few of the myriad examples have just been alluded to. But the fact that today\u2019s global hegemon adopts the reprehensible practices of its predecessors still leaves us free to expose the crimes of today\u2019s official enemies, a task that should be undertaken, and surely will be in this case. Others outside of the reach of the U.S. propaganda system will be appalled by the hypocrisy, but that\u2019s no reason not to welcome the highly selective exposure of war crimes. Those with some perverse interest in looking at ourselves can learn some lessons from the way atrocities are handled when exposed. The most notable case is the My Lai massacre, finally recognized after freelance reporter Seymour Hersh exposed the crimeto the West. In South Vietnam, it had long been known but did not arouse much attention. The Quaker medical center in Quang Ngai didn\u2019t even bother reporting it because such crimes were so common. In fact, the official U.S. government investigation found another one like it at the nearby village of My Khe. The My Lai massacre could be absorbed within the propaganda system by restricting the blame to GIs in the field who didn\u2019t know who was going to shoot at them next. Exempt were \u2014 and are \u2014 those who sent them on these mass murder expeditions. Furthermore, the focus on one of the many crimes on the ground served to conceal the fact that they were the merest footnote to a huge bombing campaign of slaughter and destruction directed from air-conditioned offices, mostly suppressed by the media, though Edward Herman and I were able to write about it in 1979, making use of detailed studies provided to us byNewsweekcorrespondent Kevin Buckley, who had investigated the crime along with his colleague Alex Shimkin but was unable to publish more than fragments. Short of such cases, which are rare, U.S. crimes are not examined and little is known about them. An old story among the very powerful. It\u2019s not easy to understand what is in the back of the minds of war criminals like Putin \u2014 or those who don\u2019t exist, according to the canon as preached byNew York Timespundits who are aghast at the discovery that war criminals exist \u2014 among official enemies."

In the event of such development, Russia has threatened to deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in the Baltic region. Does it make sense for neutral countries to join NATO? Do they really have reasons to be concerned about their own security?",
    "output": "Let\u2019s return to the overwhelming consensus of Western military analysts and political elites: The Russian military is so weak and incompetent that it couldn\u2019t conquer cities near its border that are defended mostly by a citizen\u2019s army. So, therefore, those with overwhelming military power must tremble in their boots about their security in the face of this awesome military power, on the march. One can understand why this conception should be a favorite in the offices of Lockheed Martin and other military contractors in the world\u2019s leading arms exporter, relishing the new prospects for expanding their bulging coffers. The fact that it is accepted in much wider circles, and also guides policy, again perhaps merits some thought. Russia does have advanced weapons, which can destroy (though evidently not conquer), so the Ukraine experience is held to indicate. For Finland and Sweden, abandoning neutrality and joining NATO might enhance the likelihood of their use. Since the security argument is not easy to take seriously, that seems to be the most likely consequence of their joining NATO. It\u2019s also worth recognizing that Finland and Sweden are already fairly well integrated into the NATO command system, just as was happening with Ukraine from 2014, solidified further with the official U.S. government policy statements of last September and November and the refusal of the Biden administration \u201cto address one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s most often stated top security concerns \u2014 the possibility of Ukraine\u2019s membership into NATO\u201d \u2014 on the eve of the invasion."

    "output": "NOAMCHOMSKY:If the information came from Pfizer and Moderna, there would be no reason to trust it. But it just happens that 100% of health agencies throughout the world and the vast majority of the medical profession and the health sciences accept the actually quite overwhelming evidence that vaccination radically reduces onset of infection and deaths. The evidence on that is very compelling. And it\u2019s therefore not surprising that it\u2019s basically universally accepted by relevant authorities. So, yes, if we heard it just from Big Pharma PR, there would be every reason for skepticism. But you can look at the data. They\u2019re available. And you can \u2014 when you do so, you can understand why there is essentially universal acceptance among the agencies that have no stake in the matter other than trying to save lives. You can understand why poor African countries who weren\u2019t paid off by Big Pharma are pleading for vaccines. Their health agencies are. And, in fact, the only exception I noted about this, apart from Trump for a period, was Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil, and he is now being under charges of a long senatorial investigation for charges of crimes against humanity for his failure to follow the normal protocol of trying to maximize the use of vaccines. Now that his reticence, reluctance on this matter has been overturned, it\u2019s having the usual effect. Vaccinations are increasing, and incidence of disease and deaths is sharply declining. That correlation is so clear that it takes a real strange refusal to look at facts to see it. And again, as I say, health agencies throughout world are uniform and agreed with the medical profession on the efficacy of vaccines. There are other things that have to be done: social distancing, care, masking in crowded places. There are measures that have to be taken. Countries where these measures have been followed carefully are doing quite well. But where there\u2019s a high level of skepticism, whatever its roots, there are serious problems."

And I\u2019m talking about Moderna and Pfizer. Moderna, the U.S. gave billions to. Pfizer, the U.S. promised to purchase so much. And both corporations, among others, have made billions. And yet, what can the U.S. do to ensure that these vaccines can be made in other places, like requiring that Moderna release the recipe? Still they will make a fortune. What has Biden not done that would allow people to have access to these life-saving vaccines?",
    "output": "NOAMCHOMSKY:I should say that Europe\u2019s record is even worse than that of the United States. Biden has made some effort, but the wealthy countries have not, including the United States, though not primarily the United States \u2014 they have not taken measures that are within their capacity to ensure that other countries that have the resources to produce vaccines will have access not only to the products, the vaccines, but also to the process of manufacturing them. We should recognize that the World Trade Organization rules, instituted mainly in the 1990s largely under U.S. initiative, they are radically protectionist, radically anti-free market. They provide protection to major corporations, Big Pharma, not only for the products they produce but to the processes by which they produce them. And that patent can easily be broken. The governments have the capacity to insist that the processes be available and that vaccines be distributed to the countries that need it. First of all, this will save uncounted numbers of lives. And, as you said, it means saving ourselves. If you let the virus run rampant in poor countries, everyone understands that mutation is likely, the kind of mutation that led to the Delta variant, now the Delta Plus variant in India, and who knows what will develop. Could be a \u2014 we\u2019ve been kind of lucky so far. The coronaviruses have been either highly lethal and not too contagious, like Ebola, or highly contagious but not too lethal, likeCOVID-19. But the next one coming down the pike might be both, might even be nonsuppressible by vaccines. We know the measures that have to be taken to try to prevent this from happening: research, preparations, health systems that work. It\u2019s not a small point. Like, there are now new antivirals coming along which don\u2019t stop the disease but prevent hospitalization. But you have to have a functioning health system. Very hard to see how these could even be usable in the United States, where the health system simply is not organized in such a way that people can get access to what they need."

    "input": "DB: At some point, soon hopefully, there will be vaccines. But how do we want to come out of this pandemic and attendant economic crisis? The status quo ante?",
    "output": "There presumably will be vaccines. There are some already that are in pretty advanced stages of testing. The most advanced, as far as I know, is almost unmentionable in the United States: the Chinese vaccine. They\u2019re already using it on large numbers of people though that may or may not be good practice, that I\u2019m not in a position to judge. But it\u2019s apparently pretty advanced, and it\u2019s taken seriously by American scientists. We don\u2019t hear about it; it won\u2019t be available to Americans if it works. There are vaccines being developed here, for example what\u2019s called the \u201cPfizer vaccine,\u201d which actually was developed by two Turkish immigrants in Germany and marketed by Pfizer. And the Moderna vaccine, these may come along. There\u2019s also an Oxford vaccine. Then comes the questions, will people take them, and can they be distributed to the people who need them? And those are open questions. There are policy choices that relate to this. So for example, there is an international consortium, COVAX \u2014 a hundred sixty or seventy countries \u2014 which have been working on trying to develop cooperation in vaccine development, which is obviously the best way. Data should be shared freely, not sequestered by particular private corporations and governments that support them. Should be shared freely, should be general involvement \u2014 there should be no monopolization of vaccines. There should be distribution arranged to the people around the world who need it, not only those rich enough to buy it. All of these things, at least in principle, are the working agenda of COVAX. How well it\u2019s being honored we could ask, but at least that\u2019s the agenda. But the US just refuses to participate, it has pulled out, so of course undermines it.The United States is not alone, some of the European countries have done this or are trying to monopolize any vaccine that comes along. Then comes the question of using it and distributing it within the country. In the United States, there are a large number of people who say, \u201cWe\u2019re just not going to accept this. We don\u2019t want the government to intrude on our personal lives. I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d There\u2019s a big anti-vaccine movement in the United States altogether, which has a lethal effect in a rich country like this. It\u2019s a significant effect in poor countries. If it spreads there, it\u2019s just lethal. But there is such a movement. It\u2019s rooted in understandable contempt or at least distrust in government, understandable, but it shouldn\u2019t reach to this domain. And that\u2019s going to be a serious problem, even if the vaccine is developed and is available. The United States is unusual, almost unique in not having a general health system. So it\u2019s not clear that if a vaccine is available it\u2019ll even be affordable, or if there\u2019ll be places where people can go to get it. That takes national coordination. The Trump administration has, of course, refused to do this. And it remains to be seen whether a Biden administration will carry out a plan. Trump has refused, until just a few days ago, to even share data with the incoming Biden administration. That, of course, makes any reaction slower and more ineffective. There should be major pressures to accelerate the development of, first of all, the imposition of procedures, which will restrict and mitigate the spread of the virus, and, secondly, efforts to make sure that when vaccines are available, they\u2019ll be essentially free and there will be distribution ensured to those who need them, who will be encouraged to take them and not being told that the vaccine is a hoax or that the disease is a hoax. We\u2019re living in a country where a large part of the population is in extreme denialism. If you can believe the polls, over three-quarters of Republicans think the election was stolen; huge percentages think global warming is not a serious problem. That is an extraordinary problem, and the denial of the pandemic is also significant. In such an atmosphere, it\u2019s going to be very hard to deal with extremely serious problems. And that\u2019s just the beginning. If we manage to overcome this crisis, there are other ones coming. We should remember what happened in 2003, because we\u2019re going to relive it. The SARS epidemic was contained. Scientists inform the world that other coronavirus epidemics, maybe pandemics, were very likely. The means to become prepared were available, they were described, they weren\u2019t pursued. The drug companies weren\u2019t interested because there\u2019s no profit in it. The government was held back by the neoliberal claims that the government can\u2019t do anything. Some things were done. The Obama administration, which was science oriented when it came into office, did convene the president\u2019s Science Advisory Council. They requested a pandemic response system, which they prepared, and it was put into operation. It was terminated in January 2017 when Trump came into office. One of his first actions was to dismantle it, to proceed to end the programs where American scientists were working with Chinese colleagues to try to identify potential viruses. The Center for Disease Control was defunded. The United States was singularly unprepared when the virus finally hit, and then came the chaotic reactions which have led to the destructive impact that you described. It\u2019s going to happen again when this one is contained. We either learn the lessons or we face even worse pandemics. We should bear in mind that so far we\u2019ve been lucky with coronaviruses. There have been some, like the present one, which are highly contagious, but not very lethal. There have been some, like Ebola, which was very lethal, and not too contagious. Nothing guarantees that the next one down the road won\u2019t be the worst of all worlds, contagious and lethal."

In fact, Trump very explicitly, I think, back around May or so, said it\u2019s the responsibility of the states, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d From his point of view, you could understand that. That meant if anything went wrong, as it was very likely to, he could blame it on the states, especially the states with Democratic governors. Of course, if significant measures are taken, it will have a harmful economic effect, so he could blame the harsh economic consequences on the methods that were taken to control the crisis. Some of the things that were done were really surreal. For example, when Rick Bright, a chief scientist in charge of vaccine development, criticized some of Trump\u2019s quack medicines, he was fired. This happened all the way up and down the line. Since the election, it\u2019s gotten worse, from simply refusing to do anything, as I said, even to hand over data. It\u2019s as if, and it may be true, they just want to make it worse, so that the country will be more ungovernable when Biden comes in, and failures can be blamed on the Democratic administration. [Mitch] McConnell, remember, who\u2019s sort of the evil genius behind many of these plans has a long record of working to render government ungovernable if it\u2019s in the wrong hands. He did that with Obama for years. It\u2019s not an attractive picture. The one positive thing is that Biden does seem to be attentive to the views of the scientific community, at least so it looks. I hope that\u2019s true, but he\u2019s sure not going to get any cooperation from the Republican Party. DB: Let\u2019s talk about the November 3 election, the record turnout of a hundred fifty million people, the success of voting by mail, and early voting.

    "output": "The Democrats lost to an incredible degree. They lost at every level, except for the presidency. And the presidency was a vote against Trump, even by many of the wealthy and the corporate sector who were tired of his antics. But at every other level \u2014 Congress, state legislatures, and local elections \u2014 they lost and lost badly. And, if you think of the circumstances, it\u2019s astonishing that Trump was even able to run. Here\u2019s somebody who had just killed tens, if not hundreds of thousands of Americans through malevolent practice, let alone all of his other crimes. And he\u2019s running for president, considered a viable candidate. And not only that, but the whole ticket that supported him, won at every level. It\u2019s an amazing defeat for the Democrats. And when you take a look, not that the Democrats are all that great, but just in terms of party politics, it was a shocking failure. I think you can see why. The Democrats devoted their campaign efforts to try to swing some affluent suburbs toward the Democrats. Well, maybe they succeeded in that. But that\u2019s not enough to develop any sort of electoral strategy. In fact, this has been going on since Obama. Since Obama, the Democratic Party has pretty much abandoned its activities at the local and state levels, just doesn\u2019t bother. It\u2019s a party of Wall Street, rich professionals, and so on. The others will take care of themselves. And you could see this in particular cases. So there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about the quite remarkable, the Democratic Party losses in South Texas on the border, largely Mexican-American community. These are areas that hadn\u2019t voted for a Republican for a century, literally, since Harding, and Trump did quite well, even won in some areas \u2014 a dramatic reversal. number of analyses have been put forth, but one that I think is very telling is that this area is an oil economy. And if you read liberal commentators, they say that Biden lost it because of the terrible gaffe in the last debate. You\u2019ll recall at the end of the last debate, Biden said something which had liberal commentators just shocked at his terrible gaffe, this horrible thing to say. And he was then trying to overcome the mistake, others were trying to do it too. What was the mistake? He said, \u201cWe have to do something to prevent the human species from being destroyed.\u201d That\u2019s basically what he said. Those weren\u2019t his words, his words were, \u201cWe have to face the fact that there\u2019s going to have to be a transition to a non-fossil fuel economy,\u201d which is equivalent to saying, \u201cWe have to do something to try to make sure, to make it likely at least that human society can survive.\u201d That was a horrible gaffe, and it affected the oil producing economies because people felt, you hear it from interviews and so on, \u201cThe Democrats are going to take my life away, are going to take away my job, my community, my businesses, and so on, just because some pointy headed liberals claim that there\u2019s a climate crisis.\u201d Now, of course, the gaffe was not saying it loudly and clearly. Yes, we have to say that loud and clear, we have to get off a fossil fuel economy and fast, within a couple of decades, which means not delaying, starting now, cutting it back each year so that, say, by mid-century, we\u2019re finished with fossil fuels. That has to be said strongly and persuasively. So what do you do about the oil producing sectors? What do you do about South Texas or areas where there\u2019s fracking in Pennsylvania? You don\u2019t just say, \u201cSorry, folks, you\u2019ve got to lose your jobs and your business and everything else because we say there\u2019s a climate crisis.\u201d What you do is go down there and organize, and explain to people what it means. It means, first of all, that this is inevitable, we have to do it, \u201cYour children and grandchildren will be consigned to hell if we don\u2019t.\u201d Secondly, there\u2019s an effective way to do it and a way to do it, which will improve your lives, give you better jobs, more jobs, more livable environment, better community, better health \u2014 here are the ways, and spell them out. It happens to be true, and it can be done. But it\u2019s not done if the Democratic National Committee is devoting its efforts to try to convince a couple of affluent suburban women to shift their vote. You have to be down there working on it. And in the places where there was mostly Latino organizing it was effective. Where I live, Maricopa County, Arizona, there has been extensive organizing Latino leadership for several years. And it continued, and they voted against Trump, but it has to be done. And the same is true of many other issues. Take the Democrats who are claiming that the election was lost because the crazy leftists were saying, \u201cdefund the police.\u201d When I think about that for a minute, if you just say, \u201cdefund the police,\u201d you\u2019re going to lose. You\u2019re telling people, \u201cI want you to have no protection if somebody breaks into your home.\u201d Nobody wants to hear that. On the other hand, if you give the actual substantive meaning of \u201cdefund the police,\u201d as Bernie Sanders, and a couple of others tried to do, it\u2019s a sensible, attractive program, which people will support. It says, \u201cTake away from the police responsibilities that they should never have in the first place\u201d \u2014 in fact the large majority of their responsibilities. Police shouldn\u2019t be involved in domestic disputes, mental health problems, lost dogs, overdose of drugs, and so on. That\u2019s not police business. These things all should be handled by community services under community control, which can do them better. So, defund the police by taking away those responsibilities. The next step, as Sanders himself tried to emphasize, is to increase salaries for the police, make it a better occupation, make better conditions for it, so the police can do the things that, in fact, any community is going to need, but not other things and not running around with heavy weapons terrorizing people. That\u2019s \u201cdefunding the police.\u201d But if you just scream the slogan, nobody hears that. What they hear is, \u201cYou don\u2019t care if people break into my home.\u201d People, by implication, black, that\u2019s the message. If you want to be serious about achieving goals, you have to pay attention to your tactics, that\u2019s crucial. Tactics aren\u2019t just something insignificant, at the fringe; any activist and organizer should know, it should be their second nature, that that\u2019s what matters. How do you approach people? How do you get them to understand what you\u2019re trying to say, what you think is for their benefit and for the benefit of others? Not by shouting a slogan. It takes work, it takes direct organizing and activism. DB: It\u2019s interesting, the alacrity of establishment Democrats to blame their poor showing on, as you mentioned, not by name, but [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and some other young, many of them women, representatives. We need real engagement from the local level on up. And without that, you can have all the nice slogans you want, it\u2019s not going to achieve anything. Some of the results of the election are pretty remarkable, now that the data are beginning to come in. [Anthony] DiMaggio has done some of the best work on these topics for years. He had a recent study of the latest available data on voting patterns, and it confirmed what\u2019s been reported elsewhere. Trump won remarkably high in almost every demographic \u2014 not out of range for what it\u2019s been in the past, but remarkably high. In one study, as he\u2019s shown before, the main support for Trump is relatively affluent, not superrich, but relatively affluent, way above the median, $100,000 to $200,000 income range. That\u2019s not working people, contrary to illusions. The median income\u2019s around $70,000. That\u2019s median. Lower than that, Trump does poorly. And when you go to higher incomes, it\u2019s sort of split. Now the rich professionals are split. The very wealthy in this election are somewhat split because of concern about the way Trump\u2019s harming their interests in the economy. But that range, $100,000 to $200,000 normally, again, was the base for Trump\u2019s support, but seems to be increased substantially since 2016. I should say that\u2019s kind of a mystery. I don\u2019t understand whether it should be true, but it happened, and we should think about it. There\u2019s a lot of problems to deal with for the Left, if it hopes to make any progress. One, of course, is the incoming Biden administration, which is very much a mixed story. Among the economic advisors and appointees, it\u2019s not too bad. People like Heather Boushey, Jared Bernstein, and Janet Yellen are appointments that can be very positive, others much less so. And across the board, there\u2019s lots to object to. Just getting rid of Trump is a major victory, but it\u2019s not going to mean very much if you can\u2019t implement policies that are substantive and effective in dealing with the massive crisis that exists.

And statehood for Puerto Rico and Washington, DC that would increase the number of senators by four. Or do you think these are just time-consuming dead ends, given the structure of politics?",
    "output": "Those are important. But remember, they\u2019re only part of the judiciary problem. McConnell, for ten years now, has been working hard to ensure that the entire judiciary, top to bottom, will be staffed by young, ultra-right Federalist Society approved lawyers, who will be able to maintain the ultra-reactionary McConnell, Trump-style programs for a generation by simply blocking everything else at every level. Now that\u2019s been the main function of the Senate, first blocking Obama\u2019s nominees, second, by ramming through the huge number of ultra-right young nominees during the Trump years. And it\u2019s been very effective. You look at the numbers and it\u2019s astonishing. McConnell has essentially eliminated the Senate as a deliberative body \u2014 theoretically once famously described as the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body. Okay, you can argue about that, but at least the term meant something. Now, it\u2019s not that. The House sends measures to the Senate, they don\u2019t even look at them. What they do is two things: pass legislation to benefit the corporate sector and the very rich, from deregulation to the incredible tax scam, and the other is to staff the judiciary with the far right. So it\u2019s not just the Supreme Court. I think admitting Puerto Rico and Washington, DC should be done. But it\u2019s going to be very hard to achieve that over a Republican Senate or to achieve anything with McConnell. The idea that you can somehow make friends with them and cooperate, that\u2019s a joke. They\u2019re out for blood. They don\u2019t want to cooperate. They want to make the country ungovernable, so that they can come back into power at every level below the president. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be seeing for the next couple of years, basically an extension of what\u2019s going on. DB: Howard Zinn said, \u201cIt would be naive to depend on the Supreme Court to defend the rights of poor people, women, people of color, dissenters of all kinds. Those rights only come alive when citizens organize, protest, demonstrate, strike, boycott, rebel, and violate the law, in order to uphold justice.\u201d That\u2019s pretty much what the historical record shows. You can go back to the Constitution. By the standards of the eighteenth century, the Constitution was moderately progressive, but it was not what the population wanted. It is well described in the major scholarly study of the formation of the Constitution, Michael Klarman\u2019s book,The Framers\u2019 Coup, on the coup of the framers against democracy. That\u2019s the scholarly gold standard \u2014 an excellent book, incidentally, very good reading. In it, you can see step by step how Madison, Hamilton, and other major figures in framing the Constitution were primarily concerned with the popular democratic thrust among the general population. A lot of it played out on issues that most people don\u2019t pay much attention to. There was a huge struggle, for example, about paper money during fighting, the American Revolution. The government had huge debts, and the question was how were they going to be paid off? Well, one proposal was to put it on the shoulders of the population and make them pay for it, not the rich speculators, we want to preserve their rights. That\u2019s the way the Constitution was framed. The population wanted paper money, so the currency would be inflated, kind of pay off the debts, the speculators would suffer from it, but the population would gain. That was one major part of the formation of the Constitution. Another part was Madison\u2019s realization that the Senate should represent the wealth of the nation, the most responsible group of men, those who have sympathy with property owners and their rights. So the Senate was given the major power among the various components of the government. It was not elected, it was picked by electors from the legislature who could be trusted to make sure that the wealthy would be in charge. And many other measures were proposed with the main purpose of preventing democracy, even large legislative districts, where people wouldn\u2019t be able to get together. Remember, this is the days of the horse and carriage and it was hard to get around. Lots of detailed measures were taken to reduce the threat of democracy and to carry out the framers\u2019 coup against democracy. But there was a problem: the population didn\u2019t accept it. You had lots of ferment, the kinds of things that Howard Zinn was talking about, uprisings, efforts to win more democratic rights took all sorts and forms. And this struggle is going on throughout American history. The Supreme Court, which you mentioned, is a good example. The Supreme Court has overwhelmingly been on the side of wealth and power, not totally, there were breaks, but that\u2019s been the strong tendency, as a conservative institution. Actually, the Constitution does not say anything about the Supreme Court having the right of judicial review, having the authority to cancel legislation. That was just introduced by the Court itself under Chief Justice [John] Marshall years later and it\u2019s become the convention since. But these are all constant struggles. And it\u2019s not just the courts and the government. It\u2019s also private power, which is enormous, has an immense influence on the government. Very recently, another high-level paper came out, a serious analysis, as far as I saw, was reported only in the LondonFinancial Times.It gave much more sophisticated and detailed evidence to support what has been shown pretty effectively for a long time, that most of the population has no influence whatsoever on governmental decisions. Maybe the top 10 percent, and of them, a very small fraction, in fact. Well, that\u2019s quite apart from the formal constitutional structure. And, of course, during the neoliberal period \u2014 the last forty years \u2014 all of this has been strongly enhanced. One of the major effects of the neoliberal period has been, as is well known, to have sharply concentrated wealth, while much of the population stagnates. That has an immediate effect on undermining of democratic decision making, for perfectly obvious reasons. There was a pretty remarkable study, which should be better known, on the transfer of wealth from the working class and the middle class to the extreme wealthy during the years since [Ronald] Reagan. The ultra-respectable RAND Corporation came out with an estimate of what they call the \u201ctransfer of wealth\u201d \u2014 we should call it \u201cThe robbery of the population by the very rich.\u201d Their estimate is, in the last forty years, $47 trillion. That\u2019s not small change. And it\u2019s an underestimate because it doesn\u2019t include lots of other things. Reagan opened the spigot on all sorts of other ways to rob the public, like tax havens, shell companies, and other devices. [Bill] Clinton added to it, not only by his radical deregulation of the financial institutions, which just sent them into the stratosphere, but also by his so-called trade agreements, which had nothing much to do with trade, certainly very little to do with free trade, but were highly advantageous to great corporate wealth and very destructive to the working class, as they predicted in advance. And, in fact, this happened. So there\u2019s been this massive robbery of the population for forty years and that has its effects on the way the government works. That\u2019s why you end up with, say, 90 percent of the population being basically unrepresented. And these struggles go on constantly. They\u2019re going to go on in the post-pandemic world. It\u2019s a radical class struggle, but one element in the struggle is always fighting: the business world. They\u2019re dedicated, they never stop. They didn\u2019t stop during the New Deal, continued, continued afterward, always going on. Unless working people, the general population, take part in the class struggle, they\u2019re going to get it in the neck. DB: Let\u2019s talk about historical memory. The seventy-fifth anniversary of the Nuremberg Tribunal for high-ranking Nazis was just marked. Robert Jackson, the chief US prosecutor and Supreme Court Justice, said, \u201cWe must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow. To pass these defendants a poison chalice is to put it to our own lips as well.\u201d"

    "output": "I even put aside the use of force. How about Obama\u2019s massive global assassination campaign, to kill people who the government claims are threatening us? Now suppose that any other government was doing that. Suppose that Iran was killing people around the world who they claim are a potential threat to them. We\u2019d notice it. When we do it, doesn\u2019t matter. There was an actually interesting article that came out a couple days ago by a major British legal authority who\u2019s been defending some of the Guantanamo prisoners. He pointed out that of the prisoners in Guantanamo, an overwhelming majority \u2014 there are plenty who still remain without any charges \u2014 have been released after US intelligence agencies carefully inspected their records and discovered that they were no threat. Now these are supposed to be the worst of the terrorists. Those are the ones the drone campaigns are aimed at. You kill plenty of other people, but theoretically they\u2019re aimed at the people who are supposedly threats. The people that were sent to Guantanamo are the peak of those who were supposed to be threats. And after years of torture and illegal imprisonment and other atrocities, they were released because it was recognized they never were a threat. What does that tell you about the drone campaign? You don\u2019t have to be a genius to figure it out, which is murdering people, not only the people we aim at, we often miss, but the families, children, wives, community, terrorizing areas, because we\u2019re trying to kill people who aren\u2019t a threat, but who somebody mistakenly said were a threat. But even if they were a threat, I mean, is Mike Pompeo a threat to Iran? So why don\u2019t they kill him? Would that be okay? Would we cheer, doing what we\u2019re supposed to be doing? Going back to Robert Jackson, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s wrong. We have proven him to be wrong. The intellectual community, good liberals, legal authorities have simply said, \u201cWe\u2019re not subject to the law. Even our own Constitution doesn\u2019t apply to us.\u201d What applies to us is what we feel like doing. DB: Hermann G\u00f6ring was the highest-ranking Nazi at Nuremberg. He said, \u201cThe victor will always be the judge and the vanquished the accused.\u201d Unfortunately, it\u2019s true. Take even the Nuremberg Tribunal itself. It was probably the least defective of all of the international tribunals. The people who were charged were undoubtedly terrible criminals. But the Nuremberg Tribunal itself was severely flawed. That was pointed out by Telford Taylor, the American counsel for the prosecution. He wrote about it later, and he agreed that there was a deep flaw in the Tribunal. Essentially, the Tribunal defined a war crime as something you did and we didn\u2019t do. So, bombing of urban concentrations to try to kill as many civilians as possible was not considered a crime. The reason was the British and the Americans did it far more than the Germans, so therefore it\u2019s not a crime. Destroying cities with the explicit goal of killing civilians \u2014 that was after all the explicit goal, we have to harm their morale by killing civilians \u2014 was not secret. That wasn\u2019t a crime. Dresden, other German cities, Tokyo, much worse than Hiroshima: not crimes. In fact, if you take a look at the Tribunal, the German war criminals were able to plead successfully that what they did was also done by the West, so therefore they were innocent. The submarine commander Admiral [Karl] Doenitz was charged with attacking civilian ships. His lawyers brought in his defense an American Admiral who said, \u201cWe did the same thing.\u201d Okay, therefore it\u2019s not a crime. That\u2019s the Nuremberg Tribunal, the best of all the tribunals. So I\u2019m glad the Tribunal took place, it\u2019s better than if it hadn\u2019t, but we shouldn\u2019t have any illusions about it. It was deeply flawed. That was victor\u2019s justice. The Tokyo Tribunal was just ridiculous. Japanese commanders were executed because of crimes committed by troops they had no contact with, things like that. DB: In the book,ReTargeting Iran, you discuss in the chapter \u201cU.S. War with Iran: Covert and Overt\u201d the proposal for a nuclear-weapons-free zone in the Middle East. Few people have ever even heard of this. And then you mention the 1976 Symington Amendment. He was a senator from Missouri. You say, \u201cU.S. aid to Israel for the past almost 40 years is illegal under U.S. law.\u201d Talk about that. There\u2019s a profession called lawyers, whose task is to show that words don\u2019t mean what they say. So I understand that. But if we look at the actual words, it\u2019s arguable, but it is certainly at least arguable that US aid to Israel is illegal under US law. There are updates to the Symington Amendment which carry it further. And there\u2019s a very interesting issue there, which is one of those things is undiscussable in the United States, but very critical to contemporary affairs. There\u2019s much highly justified concern now about a possible war with Iran. Is Trump going to go out in a blaze of glory by bombing around or something like that? But take the whole issue with Iran, not just Trump, Obama, everyone else. Iran is supposed to be a terrible threat to peace, maybe the greatest threat to peace. And worst of all is their program for developing nuclear weapons. Let\u2019s think about that for a moment. Let\u2019s say Benjamin Netanyahu is right, they are secretly developing nuclear weapons. Is there a way to stop that? Yes, a very simple way. Impose a nuclear-weapons-free zone in the Middle East with intensive inspections. We know that inspections can work. US intelligence confirms that, the International Atomic Energy Agency confirms it. They were very effective during the period of the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement, the Iran Deal. So reinstitute them and impose a nuclear-weapons-free zone. Is anybody opposed to that? Actually, only two countries, the US and Israel. Arab countries are strongly in favor, Iran is strongly in favor, non-aligned countries, most of the world, former non-aligned, so called G77, a hundred thirty or so countries strongly support it, and Europe supports it. Every time it comes up, the US vetoes it. Obama, in 2015, came up to the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review conference. Everyone in favor, Obama blocked it. In meetings since, same thing. Why does the United States block it? Everybody knows, nobody can say, because it would mean that Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons would be subject to inspection. The United States does not officially recognize that Israel has nuclear weapons. It\u2019s a joke. Everybody knows they have nuclear weapons, but the US government won\u2019t recognize it. That goes back to the Symington Amendment. As soon as you recognize it, it opens that door. Nobody in the government, Democrat or Republican, wants to open that door. The liberal intellectual community doesn\u2019t want to open that door. So you don\u2019t have any discussion of a very simple way of ending whatever threat you think Iran poses. So, there\u2019s no justification for murderous sanctions, no justification anyway, but the official justification gets totally knocked down. No justification for the efforts to torture Iranians, especially now during the pandemic \u2014 none. All goes, simple solution, can\u2019t talk about it. I mean, you can talk about it in arms control circles, and it\u2019s a free country, I can give talks about it, as I\u2019ve done a thousand times. Pointing this out, of course, audiences understand immediately. In fact, I should say that if there were a really functioning Palestinian solidarity organization here, this would be one of its top priorities. Let\u2019s impose a nuclear-weapons-free zone in the Middle East. Let\u2019s pursue the fact that US aid to Israel is arguably even in violation of US law. This is not incidentally the only case. There\u2019s the so-called Leahy Law, Senator Patrick Leahy, which bans US military aid to any military unit anywhere that\u2019s engaged in systematic human rights violations. The Israeli army is up to its neck in systematic human rights violations all the time. You can read about it in the Israeli press, Israeli human rights groups,B\u2019Tselem, international human rights groups \u2014 it\u2019s not a secret. So yes, there are points where activist pressures could make a big difference. They\u2019re not being carried out, unfortunately. But these are things that are kept under a veil, you don\u2019t want to talk about them. It\u2019s kind of like the Chinese vaccine, even worse, we don\u2019t talk. That\u2019s at least sometimes mentioned \u2014 this, you can search, it\u2019s almost a total ban. And I should add there\u2019s more to it. The United States and Britain are uniquely committed to a nuclear-weapons-free zone, and there\u2019s a reason. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the United States and Britain rammed through a Security Council resolution, which called on Saddam Hussein to eliminate his nuclear weapons programs, which he in fact did. The resolution had a series of other provisions. One of them, Article 14, commits the signers, the United States and Britain to work to establish a nuclear-weapons-free zone in the region. That\u2019s a US-British sponsored Security Council resolution calling on these two states to move to institute a nuclear-weapons-free zone in the region. They have a unique responsibility to do it, meaning to open up Israeli nuclear weapons to inspection and to raise the question about the legality of US economic and military aid to Israel. That\u2019s a direct duty, cannot be discussed. Of course, it can, like we\u2019re talking about and we\u2019ve talked about it before. But it can\u2019t enter the mainstream. DB: This year began with the US assassination of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, and it almost is ending with the assassination of the Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, probably by Israel. David Sanger, writing in theNew York Times, reported, \u201cThe assassination threatens to cripple President-elect Biden\u2019s efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal before he can even begin his diplomacy with Tehran.\u201d And he continues, \u201cAnd that may well have been a main goal of the operation.\u201d"

What\u2019s going on with US-Iran relations in this interim period and the dangers of a possible wider war?",
    "output": "That\u2019s an important question, but we should remember there\u2019s a background. Why is the United States torturing Iran in the first place? What is the justification for the US sanctions regime? This is not the first murder of a nuclear weapons scientist. There have been a string of others, sabotage of Iranian facilities \u2014 just one very recently. What\u2019s the justification for any of them? Actually none, as I just mentioned, but let\u2019s talk about this specific one. I think that analysis is pretty plausible. It looks as if, for some time now, the Trump/[Mike] Pompeo administration has been trying hard to provoke Iran to carry out some kind of act, which can be used as a pretext for a sharp escalation of the war against Iran. Notice we are at war against Iran. We have a blockade. US sanctions are a serious business, US sanctions are third party sanctions, which means everyone in the world must observe them or else. Europe doesn\u2019t like them, but they have to observe them, or else we\u2019ll toss them out of the international financial system. We just saw this shown dramatically at the UN a couple of weeks ago. The United States went to the Security Council and requested, meaning demanded, that the Security Council renew the lapsed sanctions against Iran. They refused, almost total refusal. Every US ally refused. The US reacted, Pompeo returned to the Security Council and said, \u201cYou are reinstituting the sanctions.\u201d They obeyed. You can\u2019t step on the toes of the godfather. Now, this also passed without comment. So, this is just one of the many examples where the Trump administration is trying almost desperately to get Iran to carry out some action, which they can use as a pretext probably for missile attacks against the nuclear facilities or something like that, to which Iran might respond. For example, they do have the missile capacity to attack the Saudi energy facilities in northeast Saudi Arabia, near the Iran border. They can attack this. That\u2019s the main center of global fossil fuel production. Also, Saudi Arabia\u2019s desalination facilities and others, although it\u2019d set off a huge war. We don\u2019t know what it would lead to. But they are eager to do this to try to ensure exactly, as Netanyahu said, that we do not go back to the earlier situation. Now actually, I agree with Netanyahu. We should not go back to the earlier agreement. What we should do is impose a new nuclear-weapons-free zone, which is really nuclear weapons will be subject to international controls and inspection, and in which US aid to Israel will be questioned. That\u2019s what we should do, not just go back to the JCPOA. So in some ways, I agree with him. But we shouldn\u2019t be trapped in this narrow conception that\u2019s provided by the media and general intellectual framework. We don\u2019t want to be trapped in that, that\u2019s wrong. But that\u2019s probably what they\u2019re trying to do. I think the analysis is correct. In fact, the Biden administration is playing along. One of their top appointees, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, recently said that the Biden administration will be willing to consider going back to the joint agreement, but the ball is in Iran\u2019s court. They have to start by cutting back, by reversing their increased enrichment of uranium. And they\u2019ve got to have a positive attitude toward negotiations. If they do that, we\u2019ll consider it. Absolutely backward. We are the ones who should be pleading with them to go back to the negotiations, which we have consistently undermined, actually destroyed under Trump, but undermined under Obama. Even under Obama, we were not living up to the agreements. The agreements, one part of them, say that no party shall try to injure the Iranian economy during the period of the negotiations. I don\u2019t remember the exact words, but it was something to that effect. The Obama administration was doing it constantly. We weren\u2019t living up to the agreements. But now the Biden administration spokesman is saying, \u201cWe might be willing to consider going back to the negotiations, if they take the first steps,\u201d as if they\u2019re the guilty party, not us. We should never accept any of this. DB: Robert Fisk, we both knew him and shared platforms with him, passed away in late October. In 2010, he said this about objectivity: \u201cIt is the duty of a foreign correspondent to be neutral and unbiased on the side of those who suffer, whoever they may be.\u201d Fisk was a critic of US foreign policy in the Middle East and the Israeli treatment of Palestinians. He wrote of the Kurdish question, the Armenian genocide, and other taboo topics. Talk about him briefly, and then this notion, this almost sacred notion of objectivity. Fisk was a marvelous correspondent, brave, honest, knowledgeable, and a great writer. Much of the profession just hated him. And now he\u2019s under very ugly attacks from many journalists. A number of good journalists have written about this, like Jonathan Cook. Now that he\u2019s dead, he can\u2019t sue anybody, and so all kind of ugly attacks are coming from journalists. It\u2019s sick. He was one of the top ones. So what about objectivity? It\u2019s a funny notion. First of all, we shouldn\u2019t pretend that we\u2019re just neutral observers. Every human being has a point of view. If you don\u2019t have a point of view on things, you\u2019re not a human being, you don\u2019t have a functioning brain. If you\u2019re a serious journalist or scholar, what you do is make your point of view very clear, so that your readers can understand it and compensate for it, and then try to be as accurate as you can about what\u2019s happening, always framed in the background about what\u2019s important to you. If what\u2019s important to you is the rights of the powerful, okay, make that clear and write from that perspective. If your point of view or your perspective is centered on the rights of the suffering and the oppressed, make that clear, and then describe that as accurately as you can, without cutting corners. But pure objectivity is just a meaningless notion in the sciences as well. No nuclear physicist approaches the next article he reads with pure objectivity, as if he didn\u2019t have some beliefs about the subject. I mean, it\u2019s just ludicrous. You read the scientific literature. paper just came out a couple of weeks ago in one of the top quantum theory journals, with a debate among a bunch of scientists, top scientists, about what a particle is, the most critical concept in physics. What\u2019s a particle, a lot of different views, people arguing about it. Any way they look at an experiment is going to be shaped by their point of view. That\u2019s fundamental physics. Suppose you\u2019re looking at the Syrian war. Of course, you\u2019re going to have a point of view. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be a fine objective journalist, as Robert Fisk was, as Patrick Cockburn, Charles Glass, Jonathan Steele, and quite a few others were. They all have a point of view. Fisk was also a great human being. I knew him personally for many years. DB: November 29 is the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, a UN-organized observance. It marks UN resolution 181 of November 29, 1947, which proposed the partition of Palestine into two states, one Arab and one Jewish. The national poet of Palestine is Mahmoud Darwish (1941\u20132008). One of his greatest poems is \u201cUnder Siege.\u201d This is the opening verse: Here on the slopes of hills, facing the dusk and the cannon of time, close to the gardens of broken shadows, We do what prisoners do, And what the jobless do: We cultivate hope."

    "input": "What hope is there for the Palestinians, a people that you have been in solidarity with for decades, at this what seems to be the bleakest moment in their history? Where more and more land and water is being annexed by Israel and the possibility of a viable, independent Palestinian state recedes?",
    "output": "It is a grim moment in the history of the Palestinians. And anyone concerned with their rights and prospects has to be super careful about two things. One, being clear about what the actual situation is. Two, being clear about the kinds of choices, of action that can be taken to try to improve, overcome, at least mitigate the crisis in which they live. Those two things require serious, clear thought, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s being done. So, on the issue of what the circumstances are, almost all discussion these days that you see is between two options. One is a two-state settlement of some sort. There has been a general international consensus on that since the 1970s, so something like that. The other option that\u2019s considered is one state, Israel, takes over the West Bank, and then an anti-apartheid struggle ensues. That\u2019s the second option. But that\u2019s missing the third and crucial option, the one that is in fact being implemented before our eyes, which has been the major guideline for Israeli policies for fifty years: A greater Israel in which Israel takes over whatever is of value to it in the West Bank \u2014 formerly Gaza, but now on the West Bank \u2014 but evades the Palestinian population concentrations. Israel does not want Nablus, doesn\u2019t want Tulkarm, doesn\u2019t want Palestinians. So, nothing like the anti-apartheid struggle, where the white population needed the black population, and in fact tried to subsidize the Bantustans, tried to make them look decent to the international community. This is quite different. Israel just wants the Palestinians out. It does use them for cheap labor, but they can get cheap exploited labor from Thailand or other places, and do in fact. They just want the Palestinians out. What they\u2019ve been doing for fifty years and what you see before your eyes, which you can see if you drive around the West Bank, is a greater Israel. Israel takes over all the valuable areas, the Jordan Valley, about a third of the territory, the fertile land, and kicks out the population on one or another pretexts. Take greater Jerusalem, a huge area about five times the size of what Jerusalem ever was, or take the city of Ma\u2019ale Adumim east of Jerusalem, built up mostly in the Clinton years, corridor to it, pretty much bisects the West Bank. Same to the north with the town of Ariel, the town of Kedumim. Leave out the Palestinian population concentrations, and don\u2019t take Nablus, that\u2019s for them, until Israel finally manages to get rid of them. The rest of the Palestinians who live in the areas that Israel\u2019s taking over, put them in isolated enclaves, separated from their olive groves, agricultural areas, herds, with checkpoints, which occasionally are open at the will of Israeli soldiers. Keep them in isolation, subjected to constant attacks by what are called hilltop youth and other terrorist crazies and just make life impossible for them. Meanwhile, the Jewish-held areas are basically suburbs of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. So you can live in Ma\u2019ale Adumim in a nice villa, subsidized by the government, and take the Jewish-only superhighway. It takes you to your job in Tel Aviv, come back to your nice, subsidized home in the suburbs in the evening. You don\u2019t even see an Arab. That\u2019s greater Israel. That\u2019s what\u2019s being implemented. Like any other new colony, anywhere, the Israeli authorities understand that you have to do something for the Palestinian elites. So, have a place where they can gather, go to the theater, have nice restaurants, shopping malls, pretend they\u2019re in Europe. That\u2019s Ramallah, basically, you\u2019ve got to do that. It\u2019s the same thing you find all through Africa and other similar neocolonial areas. That\u2019s the reality. Israel is not going to accept taking over the Palestinian population. Israel is not going to accept becoming a minority state with a minority of Jews. We can be quite certain of that. So that\u2019s just not an option. A lot of talk about it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an option. Discuss that, but it seems to me that\u2019s what has to be faced. As far as actions are concerned that could overcome this crisis, there\u2019s one point that\u2019s critical, and that\u2019s the United States. If the United States continues, as it has pretty consistently, with some breaks, to support the Israeli greater Israel project, they\u2019ll just continue with it. No reason for them to stop, as long as the global godfather says, \u201cYou can go ahead.\u201d Will it continue? I think that\u2019s an open question. If you look at support for Israel within the United States, it\u2019s shifted radically over the last couple of decades. Go back twenty years and beyond, Israel was the darling of the liberal population, loved Israel, it\u2019s the most wonderful place in the world. I think this was true pretty much worldwide, saying, \u201cSwedish teenagers could live in a kibbutz because it was that wonderful.\u201d That\u2019s all changed. Israel is now a pariah state among liberal opinion. In fact, most people who identify as liberal Democrats are more supportive of Palestinian rights. Support for Israel has shifted to the far right, as Israel itself has shifted to the far right. So, the support for Israel in the United States is now in the Republican Party. It\u2019s evangelicals, ultra-nationalists, those connected to military industry, which has very tight links to Israel. That\u2019s the support for Israel. And there are open possibilities. This is also true of the younger Jewish population, I should say. A lot of possibilities for trying to move to shift US policy, and they\u2019re very concrete things. We\u2019ve already mentioned a few, the legitimacy of US military and economic aid to Israel. Sore point, that\u2019s why nobody wants to talk about it. But it\u2019s a point for activism, and there are other things like that. Israel\u2019s constant violations of international law or it\u2019s huge human rights violations, that\u2019s the vicious repression in the occupied territories. All of this should be front and center. And I think with that, there could be a change in US policy, and it doesn\u2019t have to be a huge change. Even bringing up the possibility of terminating or limiting the huge economic and military aid to Israel would have a big effect, moving forward on even more. So, I think there are things that can be done. I don\u2019t think the situation\u2019s hopeless. But you have to be clear about it. Ask yourself what can be done effectively, not what makes you feel righteous. It\u2019s kind of like talking about \u201cdefund the police.\u201d You have to do it in a way which is going to work, not in a way which is going to be self-destructive."

First they reject theWHOtests, that would have been critical, and now saying they\u2019re going to defund the World Health Organization. NOAMCHOMSKY:Well, this is typical behavior of autocrats and dictators. When you make colossal errors which are killing thousands of people, find somebody else to blame. And in the United States, it\u2019s unfortunately the case, for well over a century, century and a half, that it\u2019s always easy to blame the \u201cyellow peril.\u201d The yellow \u2014 \u201cThey\u2019re coming after us.\u201d We\u2019ve seen this all through my life, in fact way before. So, blame the World Health Organization, blame China, claim that the World Health Organization has insidious relations with China, is practically working for them. And that sells to a population that\u2019s been deeply indoctrinated for a long time, way back to the Chinese Exclusion Acts in the 19th century, to say, \u201cYeah, those yellow barbarians are coming over to destroy us.\u201d That\u2019s almost instinctive. And it\u2019s backed up by the echo chamber, so, you know, say, Rush Limbaugh. Science is one of the four corners of deceit, along with the media, academia \u2014 I forget one of the others, but they\u2019re the four corners of deceit. They live on deceit. You keep driving that into people\u2019s heads. They say, \u201cWhy should we believe anything? Why should we believe the news? It\u2019s just fake news. They\u2019re all trying to destroy our savior, our president, the greatest president ever.\u201d I\u2019m old enough to remember as a child listening to Hitler\u2019s speeches over the radio, Nuremberg rallies. I couldn\u2019t understand the words, but the tone and the reaction of the crowd, the adoring crowd, was very clear and very frightening. We know what it led to. It\u2019s hard to \u2014 it comes to mind at once when you listen to Trump\u2019s ravings and the crowd. I don\u2019t suggest that he\u2019s anything like Hitler. Hitler had an ideology, horrible ideology, not only massacring all the Jews and 30 million Slavs and the Roma, and conquering much of the world, but also an internal ideology: The state, under control of the Nazi Party, should control every aspect of life, should even control the business community. That\u2019s not the world we\u2019re in. In fact, it\u2019s almost the opposite, business controlling the government. And as far as Trump is concerned, the only detectable ideology is pure narcissism. Me, that\u2019s the ideology. As long as I am smart enough to keep serving the real masters, pour money into the pockets of the very wealthy and the corporate sector, and they\u2019ll let you get away with your antics. It\u2019s pretty striking to see what happened at the Davos conference this January. That\u2019s the meeting of the people who are called the \u201cmasters of the universe\u201d \u2014 CEOs of the major corporations, you know, big media stars and so on. They get together in Davos once a year, congratulate each other on how wonderful they are, put on a pose of dedicated humanists who couldn\u2019t do \u2014 you know, just totally devoted to the welfare of the people of the world. \u201cYou\u2019re safe leaving your fate in our hands because we\u2019re such good guys.\u201d Trump came along and gave the keynote address. They don\u2019t like Trump. His vulgarity is incompatible with the image that they\u2019re trying to project of cultivated humanism. But they wildly applauded him, lustily applauded every word, because they know that he does recognize which pockets you have to fill with dollars and how to do it. And as long as he does that, as long as he serves his major constituency, they\u2019ll let him get away with the antics \u2014 in fact, like it, because he mobilizes a crowd that will back policies like his legislative achievements. Main one is a tax scam that pours money into the hands of the corporate coffers and harms everyone else. The deregulation is great for business. They love it. They can destroy the environment and harm people as much as they want. Very harmful to the population. You cut back on pollution constraints, on auto emission regulations, what happens? People die of pollution, of mercury poisoning. The waters are poisoned. And the world, it goes, is facing disaster. You\u2019re accelerating the disaster. As I said, even in the February 10th budget, while cutting back on protection against diseases in the midst of a raging pandemic, increases funding for fossil fuel production, which is going to destroy us all. Of course, a lot more money for the Pentagon and for his famous wall. But that\u2019s the world we\u2019re living in \u2014 here, not everywhere. As I said, the Asian countries have been acting sensibly. New Zealand actually seems to have killed it also. Taiwan is doing very well. In Europe, Germany has maybe the lowest death rate in the world, Norway, as well. There are ways to react. And there are ways to try to destroy everything \u2014 what President Trump is leading, with the support of the Murdoch echo chamber, Fox News and others. And amazingly, this conjuring act is working. So, with one hand, you raise your hand to heaven: \u201cI\u2019m the chosen one. I\u2019m your savior. I\u2019m going to rebuild America, make it great again for you, because I\u2019m the servant. I\u2019m the loyal servant of the working class,\u201d and so on. Meanwhile, with the other hand, you\u2019re stabbing them all in the back. And to carry this off is an act of political genius. You have to recognize that serious talent is involved, whether intuitive or conscious planning. It\u2019s devastating. We\u2019ve seen it before. We see it now in dictators, autocrats, sociopaths who happen to get into leadership positions. And it\u2019s now happening in the richest, most important country in world history."

The corporations right now are hiding their copies of Ayn Rand and rushing to the nanny state and asking for benefits from the public to overcome the results of their criminal behavior. What have they been doing for the last years? Profits have been going sky high. They\u2019ve been indulging in an orgy of stock buybacks, which are devices to increase the wealth for the rich shareholders and for management while undermining the productive capacity of the enterprise at a huge scale, setting their offices somewhere in a little room in Ireland so they don\u2019t have to pay taxes, using tax havens. This is not small change. This is tens of trillions of dollars, robbing the taxpayer. Does that have to be the case?",
    "output": "Take the current giveaway to corporations. It should be accompanied by conditionalities \u2014 term we\u2019re familiar with from theIMF. They should be required to ensure that there will be no more use of tax havens, there will be no more stock buybacks, period. If they don\u2019t do that, with a firm guarantee, no money from the public. Is that utopian? Not at all. That was the law, and the law was enforced, up until Ronald Reagan, who turned on the spigot to rob as much as you like, with Milton Friedman and other luminaries in the background telling him, \u201cThat\u2019s liberty.\u201d \u201cLiberty\u201d means rob the public massively by things like tax havens and stock buybacks. So there\u2019s nothing utopian about these conditions. It says, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to a period of pretty much regimented capitalism,\u201d which developed since Roosevelt, was carried through \u2019til the \u201970s, when it began to erode, and, with Reagan, just ended. There should be further conditionalities, should be working people should be placed \u2014 part of management should be representatives of workers. Is that impossible? No, it\u2019s done in other countries, Germany, for example. There should be a requirement that they guarantee a living wage \u2014 not just minimum wage, a living wage. That\u2019s a conditionality that can be imposed. Now, we can move further and recognize \u2014 notice that all of this is pre-Trump. Trump is taking a failing, lethal system and turning it into a monstrosity, but the roots were before him. Just think back to the reason why the pandemic occurred in the first place. Drug companies are following capitalist logic. They don\u2019t want to do anything. The neoliberal hammer says the government can\u2019t do anything the way it did in the past. You\u2019re caught in a vise. Then comes along Trump and makes it incomparably worse. But the roots of the crisis are pre-Trump. The same with the healthcare system. Like we know that \u2014 everyone knows \u2014 they should know the basic facts. It\u2019s an international scandal: twice the costs of comparable countries, some of the worst outcomes. The costs were recently estimated by a study inThe Lancet, one of the world\u2019s leading medical journals. They estimated that the costs, the annual \u2014 annual costs to Americans are close to half a trillion dollars and 68,000 lives lost. That\u2019s not so small. AMYGOODMAN:World-renowned political dissident, linguist and author Noam Chomsky.

I\u2019m Amy Goodman, as we return to Part 2 of our conversation with Noam Chomsky, world-renowned linguist, political dissident and author. I asked him about Gaza, one of the most densely populated places on Earth, where at least 13 cases ofCOVID-19 have been reported. The World Health Organization reports there are just 87 ventilators for Gaza\u2019s 2 million residents. Nearly 300 cases and two deaths have been confirmed in the West Bank.

    "output": "NOAMCHOMSKY:It\u2019s almost impossible to think about. Gaza is 2 million people who are in the \u2014 living in a prison, open-air prison, under constant attack. Israel, which is the occupying power, recognized by everyone in the world except Israel \u2014 Israel is imposing \u2014 has been imposing very harsh sanctions ever since the Palestinians made the mistake of carrying out the first free election in the Arab world and electing the wrong people. The United States and Israel came down on them like a ton of bricks. Israel\u2019s policy, as was explained by Dov Weissglas, the person in charge of the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the withdrawal of the settlers and imposition of the new regime \u2014 he explained frankly, \u201cWe are putting the people of Gaza on a diet, just enough to keep them alive,\u201d meaning wouldn\u2019t look good if they all die, but not anything more than that. So, not a piece of chocolate or a toy for a child. That\u2019s out. Just enough to stay alive. And if you have a serious health problem, maybe you can apply to go to the hospital in East Jerusalem. Maybe after a couple of weeks, you\u2019ll be allowed to go. Maybe a child is allowed to go, but his mother is not allowed to come. If the pandemic \u2014 there are now a couple of cases in Gaza. If that extends, it\u2019s a total disaster. International institutions have pointed out that by 2020 \u2014 that\u2019s now \u2014 Gaza will probably become barely livable. About 95% of the water is totally polluted. The place is a disaster. And Trump has made sure that it will get worse. He withdrew funding from the support systems for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank \u2014UNRWA, killed the funding; Palestinian hospitals, killed the funding. And he had a reason. They weren\u2019t praising him enough. They weren\u2019t respectful of the god, so, therefore, we\u2019ll strangle them, even when they\u2019re barely surviving under a harsh and brutal regime. Incidentally, this extends to Palestinians in Israel, as well. Human rights activists in Israel pointed out recently \u2014 there\u2019s articles about it inHaaretz\u2014 that Israel finally began to set up a few drive-by testing areas only in Jewish areas, not in the areas with Palestinian population. And to make sure that the intended results would follow, they announced it only in Hebrew, not in Arabic, so Palestinians wouldn\u2019t even know. Well, that\u2019s within Israel. In the Occupied Territories, far worse. And the Trump hammer came in saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not even going to give you a penny, because you\u2019re not respectful enough of me.\u201d I don\u2019t know how to describe this kind of thing.

For example, in the Philippines, where the authoritarian leader, Trump ally, Duterte, talks about killing people; the massive crackdown, without support of the people of India, 1.3 billion people, with Narendra Modi. President Trump was in India as the pandemic was taking off, never saying a word about it, packing a stadium of 100,000 people. You have Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, who is now ruling by decree. What would it take to turn that around to be a progressive response?",
    "output": "NOAMCHOMSKY:Well, actually, what\u2019s happening, to the extent that you can find some coherent policy in the madness in the White House, one thing does emerge with considerable clarity \u2014 namely, an effort to construct an international of the most reactionary states and oppressive states, led by the gangster in the White House. Now, this is taking shape. I can run through it, but since you mentioned India, Modi, who is a Hindu nationalist extremist, is systematically moving to destroy Indian secular democracy and to crush the Muslim population. What\u2019s happening in Kashmir is horrifying. It was bad enough before, now getting much worse. Same with the Muslim population, a huge population in India. The current lockdown is almost \u2014 you can almost describe it as genocidal. Modi gave, I think, a four-hour warning saying total lockdown. That\u2019s over a billion people. Some of them have nowhere to go. People in the informal economy, which is a huge number of people, are just cast out. \u201cGo walk back to your village,\u201d which may be a thousand miles away. \u201cDie on the roadside.\u201d This is a huge catastrophe in the making, right on top of the strong efforts to impose the ultra-right Hindutva doctrines that are at the core of Modi\u2019s thinking and background. What\u2019s happening in \u2014 quite apart from this, India \u2014 in fact, South Asia generally \u2014 is going to become unlivable pretty soon, if current climate policies persist. Last summer, the temperature in Rajasthan went up to 50 degrees centigrade. And it\u2019s increasing. There\u2019s hundreds of millions of people in India that don\u2019t have access to water. It\u2019s going to get much worse, could lead to a nuclear war between the two powers that basically rely on the same water resources, which are declining under global warming: Pakistan and India. I mean, the horror story that\u2019s developing is, again, indescribable. You can\u2019t find words for it. And some people are cheering about it, like Donald Trump and his friend Bolsonaro in Brazil, a couple of other sociopaths. But how do you counter a reactionary international? By developing a Progressive International. And there are steps to that. They don\u2019t get much publicity, but this \u2014 I think it\u2019s this coming December, there will be a formal announcement of what has been in process for some time. Yanis Varoufakis, the founder and leading figure in DiEM25, the progressive movement in Europe, very important \u2014 Varoufakis and Bernie Sanders came out with a declaration calling for a Progressive International to combat and, we hope, overcome the reactionary international based in the White House. Now, if you look at the level of states, this looks like an extremely unequal competition. But states are not the only things that exist. If you look at the level of people, it\u2019s not impossible. It\u2019s possible to construct a Progressive International based on people, ranging from the organized political groups that have been proliferating, that have gotten a huge shot in the arm from the Sanders campaign, ranging from them to self-help mutual aid, self-help organizations that are rising in communities all over the world, in the most impoverished areas of Brazil, for example, and even this astonishing fact that I mentioned, that the murderous crime gangs are taking responsibility for bringing some form of decent protection against the pandemic in the favelas, the miserable slums, in Rio. All of this is happening on the popular level. If it expands and develops, if people don\u2019t just give up in despair but work to change the world, as they\u2019ve done in the past under much worse conditions, if they do that, there\u2019s a chance for a Progressive International. And notice, bear in mind, that there are also striking cases of internationalism, progressive internationalism, at the state level. So, take a look at the European Union. The rich countries in Europe, like Germany, have recently given us a lesson in just what the union means. Right? Germany is managing pretty well. They probably have the lowest death rate in the world, in organized society. Right next door, northern Italy is suffering miserably. Is Germany giving them any aid? No. In fact, Germany even blocked the effort to develop euro bonds, general bonds in Europe which could be used to alleviate the suffering in the countries under the worst conditions. But fortunately for Italy, it can look across the Atlantic for aid from the superpower on the Western Hemisphere, Cuba. Cuba is, once again, as before, exhibiting extraordinary internationalism, sending doctors to Italy. Germany won\u2019t do it, but Cuba can. China is providing material aid. So, these are steps towards progressive internationalism at the state level.

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: The 2020 U.S. presidential election is less than a year from now, and, while most polls seem to indicate that Trump will lose the national vote, the electoral vote is up for grabs. What manner of a democracy is this, and why isn\u2019t there a public outcry in this country about the antiquated institution of the electoral college?",
    "output": "Preliminary comment: I find it psychologically impossible to discuss the 2020 election without emphasizing, as strongly as possible, what is at stake: survival, nothing less. Four more years of Trump may spell the end of much of life on Earth, including organized human society in any recognizable form. Strong words, but not strong enough. I would like to repeat the words of Raymond Pierrehumbert, a lead author of the startling [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report of October 2018, since replaced by still more dire warnings: \u201cWith regard to the climate crisis, yes, it\u2019s time to panic. We are in deep trouble.\u201d These should be the defining terms of the 2020 election. Environmental catastrophe is an imminent threat. Much of the world is taking steps to deal with it \u2014 inadequate, but at least something. Trump and the political organization he now virtually owns are taking steps too \u2014 to exacerbate the crisis. Some may recall [George] W. Bush\u2019s infamous call, \u201cbring it on,\u201d directed to Iraqis preparing to \u201cattack us\u201d (in what happened to be their country, but put that aside). Bush later apologized, with regret, but Trump is proud to outdo him, calling on the rising seas and burning Earth to put an end to the human experiment. In fairness, we should add that Trump is also pursuing ways to avert the environmental threat \u2014destroy us first by nuclear war. That is the simple logic of his demolition of the Reagan-Gorbachev [Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces] Treaty followed at once by testing of missiles that violate it; the threat to dismantle the (Eisenhower-initiated) Open Skies Treaty, and finally, New START. These final blows to the arms control regime constitute, very simply, a call to other nations to join us in creating new and even more horrendous weapons to destroy us all, to the unrestrained applause of weapons manufacturers. Those are the highly likely consequences of more of Trump and the party that grovels at his feet, terrified of his adoring base. They provide the essential background for the 2020 elections. Turning finally to your question, the electoral college is not the most serious anachronism \u2014 even worse is the radically undemocratic Senate. These problems are severe, and remediable only by constitutional amendment that is sure to be blocked by the small states. All of this is part of more fundamental problems. A variety of demographic, structural and policy factors are converging to a situation where a small minority \u2014 white, rural, Christian, traditional, older, fearful of losing \u201ctheir America\u201d \u2014 will be able to dominate the political system. These considerations raise further questions about worship of a document from centuries ago that was in some ways progressive by the standards of its day, but would very likely lead to rejection of an appeal for membership in the European Union by a country bound by it."

    "output": "The dark forces were gathering long before Trump appeared to mobilize them. It\u2019s worth recalling that in previous Republican primaries, candidates that emerged from the base \u2014 Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Santorum \u2014 were intolerable to the conservative establishment and were crushed. In 2016, those efforts failed. None of this is too surprising. In recent years, the Republican Party has dedicated itself [with] such fervor to its constituency of wealth and private power that a voting base had to be mobilized on grounds unrelated to its primary policy objectives \u2014 with many dark forces. And it\u2019s also worth recalling that there are parallels elsewhere, notably in Europe, with the collapse of centrist parties. Much of what has been happening can be traced to the neoliberal assault on the general population launched a generation ago, leaving in its wake quite understandable anger, frustration and search for scapegoats \u2014 terrain that can readily be plowed by demagogues and con artists of the Trump variety.

    "output": "The donor class is clearly perturbed by Warren\u2019s critique of wealth and corporate power, and even more so by Sanders, who committed a major crime: inspiring a popular movement that doesn\u2019t just show up every four years to push a button and then leave matters to their betters, but continues its activism and the engagement in public affairs that is none of their business, according to long-standing democratic theory. The intense hatred of [Labour Party leader Jeremy] Corbyn in England, I think, has a similar basis. These have been concerns of the self-described \u201cmen of best quality\u201d since the first modern democratic revolution in 17th-century England, and they haven\u2019t abated. The consequences are hard to predict. If the donor class succeeds in nominating a centrist candidate, progressive activist forces might be disillusioned and reluctant to do the work on the ground that will be needed to prevent the tragedy \u2014 repeat,tragedy\u2014 of four more years of Trumpism. If a progressive candidate does gain the nomination, centrist power and wealth may back away, again opening the path to tragedy. It will be a fateful year.

    "input": "And it was a very weird thing for Putin to be saying at that point, when he\u2019s trying to justify an invasion. He was basically saying, you have no reason to exist, we\u2019re coming in. And so I want to know from you, how do you analyze the Putin regime? It\u2019s so curious, Noam, it\u2019s like the Russians are very tied in with transnational capital, yet you have a regime that has a nationalist expansionist agenda. What do you make of that?",
    "output": "Well, that was indeed the announcement on the eve of the invasion. And I presume he was stating what he has already always believed. As he stated publicly many times along with many other Russians, the decision of Gorbachev to break up the Russian, the Soviet system, which was in fact an imperial system in which Russia had non-Russian satellites that it controlled, breaking up. The Soviet Union, he said, was a great tragedy and strategic error. This is often quoted. He also said something else which is rarely quoted. He said that anyone who wants to reestablish the Soviet Union and its former borders is out of his mind. And in fact, that\u2019s true. Russia has, whatever Putin may believe, they certainly haven\u2019t even the minimal capacity to do anything like... Russia is a state with an economy roughly the size of Spain and Italy, a weak, kleptocratic, raw material exporting state. With a big army, huge army, and advanced weapons, nuclear weapons. But a declining kleptocracy based on raw materials export. It\u2019s not about to conquer anybody. Inconceivable. Ukraine is indeed a special case, as it\u2019s been for 30 years. Well, that was Putin\u2019s statement. But there were also official Russian statements at the same time about what their precise goals were in Ukraine. They were coming from Sergey Lavrov, foreign minister, other leading officials. They stated that the main goals were neutralization and demilitarization of Ukraine. Secondarily, establishment of what they call security, meaning taking over the Donbas regions. Crimea is just off the table. You may not like it, but it\u2019s a fact of life. Those were the official statements about the invasion. What Putin has in the back of his mind is of interest to people concerned with his mind. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m interested in the policies. Well, those policies are basically within the framework of what everyone knows is the possible negotiated settlement. It\u2019s been true for a long time before the invasion, it was quite clear, stated clearly, that any peaceful settlement of the Ukraine conflict will have to involve what Lavrov called the main goals: neutralization of Ukraine and what they call demilitarization, which means removing military weapons that threaten Russia. In other words, in status, they\u2019re very much like Mexico. It\u2019s not written on paper, but everyone with a brain functioning knows that Mexico cannot join a Chinese run hostile military alliance within, to quote Biden\u2019s position, within a Chinese regime enhanced opportunities partner with China, providing robust training and exercise programs with the Chinese army, and placing weapons on the Mexican border. All of that is just so far out of the question that you can\u2019t even begin to discuss it. Well, that\u2019s essentially what Lavrov, the official statement, was proposing for Ukraine. Whether it could have worked we don\u2019t know, because the effort wasn\u2019t made to try it and see if it could work. Maybe. Instead, what we had was Biden\u2019s policy statement, which I quoted now. Bill Fletcher Jr.:But here\u2019s my concern, Noam. In 1994, the Ukrainians and Russians signed the Budapest accord in which, as you know, the Ukrainians gave up their nuclear weapons. And they had the third largest nuclear arsenal on the planet. But they gave it up on a condition that Russia would never attack them. And it would be interesting if they hadn\u2019t signed that pact, what kind of discussion we\u2019d be having today. But leaving that aside for a second, that was the agreement. There was very little interest in Ukraine joining NATO until 2014 when Crimea is seized and the Russians start supporting the secessionist movements. And so I\u2019m concerned. When you\u2019re talking about the issue of Russians warning security, it doesn\u2019t sound like they want security, it sounds more like they wanted a satellite state."

    "input": "Is Mexico a satellite state of the United States?",
    "output": "Bill Fletcher Jr.:That\u2019s a very interesting question. For much of the 20th century, it was [crosstalk] essentially a neo colony. Austria wasn\u2019t anybody\u2019s satellite. Finland wasn\u2019t anybody\u2019s satellite state. Unlike Mexico, they were neutral. Austria was neutral by treaty. Finland neutral by treaty. They could be as much part of the West as they liked. They became Western oriented and what we call capitalist democracies, integrated totally into the Western system. They had constraints. They could not enter into a hostile military alliance run by the United States which carried out military maneuvers on their territory and placed offensive weapons aiming at Russia. Is that an infringement of sovereignty? In some sense, but it certainly had no effect on the life and practice of Austria, Finland, Switzerland, Mexico, and so on. That\u2019s the status that could have been, that might have been achieved for Ukraine if the United States had been willing. Well \u2013 Bill Fletcher Jr.:But why the United States? When you place the responsibility on the United States, and I keep wondering about 2014. If the Budapest accord said Russia would not attack Ukraine in exchange for the nuclear weapons, and in 2014, the Russians, disenchanted with what was happening in Ukraine, seize Crimea and promote a secessionist movement in the East, how does that lead the Ukrainians to even believe that the Russians could stand by a treaty? If they broke one. They broke a major one. So I understand what you\u2019re saying about Austria and Finland. I mean, it makes perfect sense when you have that kind of neutralization, but this was after Ukraine had been the subject of Russian abuse. Certainly Ukraine could not assume that Russia would abide by treaty anymore than dozens of countries around the world which have been subjected to US military intervention could have faith that the United States would observe a treaty. Remember what the Russians did in Ukraine is, of course, criminal. I have to applaudThe New York Timeseditors a couple of days ago for quoting the Nuremberg principles and pointing out that Russia violated them by committing \u201cthe supreme international crime,\u201d which differs from other war crimes in that it includes the accumulated evil of the whole, everything that follows. Yes, good for the New York Times editors to recognize, to quote that, as far as I know for the first time in response to Russia\u2019s violating it. But of course the US violates it routinely, just constantly. The US violated it when it invaded Iraq, when it bombed Serbia, when it overthrew the government of Chile, Guatemala, Iran, just go on. I don\u2019t have to go on with this. Bill Fletcher Jr.:No. It violates it constantly. Bill Fletcher Jr.:Correct. It constantly violates the UN charter, the supreme Law of the Land according to the Constitution, which bans the threat or use of force in international affairs. Can you think of a single US president who\u2019s lived up to the US Constitution? Well, I can\u2019t. Of course, they all violate the supreme Law of the Land and nobody trusts them. The question is, are the circumstances such that the great powers will live up to their commitments? Not because they\u2019re nice guys, they aren\u2019t, but because those are the circumstances. So let\u2019s suppose that the United States, since the 1990s, suppose it had abided by the warnings of a whole host of US senior statesmen: George Kennan, Ambassador Jack Matlock, Reagan\u2019s ambassador to Russia, leading Russian specialist Chas Freeman, who I quoted, another ambassador. Directors of the CIA including the current director. Not a long list of other high-level diplomats and government advisors who had made it clear and explicit that though Russia would tolerate a violation of Bush\u2019s commitment and regular humiliation up to a point, they did have a red line. The red line was, again, Georgia and Ukraine, which are deep within the Russian geostrategic heartland, as recognized on all sides. So that was the red line. Well, suppose the United States had agreed with these high-level advisors and diplomats and world opinion, and Germany and France, for example, and had recognized the Russian red lines, and agreed to a status for Ukraine that was comparable to Austria, Switzerland, Finland, Mexico, and so on. Would Russia have invaded? We don\u2019t know for sure, but I think there was a way to find out. That would be by withdrawing the September 2021 policy statement which I quoted, and agreeing to enter into negotiations to see if the general agreed guidelines could be met. Only one way to find out, to try. The US did the opposite. To quote Ambassador Freeman again, the US has chosen, quoting him, to \u201cfight to the last Ukrainian.\u201d In other words, to abandon any hope for a peaceful settlement and to ensure that the worst will happen. Well, I think Ambassador Freeman is quite accurate. Now, would the Russians have committed the supreme international crime anyway? We don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Nobody knows. But there were ways to try to avert it, and those ways were not taken and are not being taken now. If you take a look at the current situation, there are two major countries that could do something to try to alleviate the horrors in Ukraine. One of them is China. China could certainly do more to try to move towards alleviating the crisis, press towards negotiations. And I think China should be criticized for not doing that. But the criticisms cannot come from the United States without ridicule because China is following US official policy. [inaudible] on the US side, it\u2019s fight to the last Ukrainian and block the prospects for peace. When President Bush says to Putin, you\u2019re a war criminal, we\u2019re going to bring you to war crimes trials, that\u2019s saying, you have no escape. The only choice for you with your back to the wall is either commit suicide or use the capacity that you have to destroy Ukraine and to move on to nuclear war. Again, I\u2019m paraphrasing Ambassador Freeman and others who have any concern for the welfare of Ukrainians. Those are the options. With Ukraine we don\u2019t know until you try."

So you\u2019re attributing a lot to the role of the US, but every NATO country has a veto over the entry of another country into NATO. So despite what the United States was pushing, there were at least two NATO countries, Germany and France, that were against the introduction of Ukraine into NATO. Putin knew this. He knew this. How do I know he knew it? Because I know it. And if I know it, Putin knew it. So the question then is if Putin knew that there were vetos against Ukraine going into NATO, despite all of the hoopla from the United States, there\u2019s something that\u2019s missing here. And then you add onto this, the claims by Putin that this campaign is about denazifying Ukraine. I mean, it\u2019s almost laughable when you look at the fascist character the Kremlin. I mean, maybe we disagree, or I\u2019m not sure. But what am I missing?",
    "output": "You\u2019re missing the nature of international affairs. In international affairs, the fact of the matter is that the United States has overwhelming power. Other countries exist, they can do something, but when the United States lays down the law, they follow it. We know that, Russia certainly knows it. Take our actions. Take for example, our 60-year war against Cuba, including Kennedy\u2019s terrorist war. Brutal, harsh, destructive sanctions, the entire world opposes them. Europe opposes them. Take a look at the United Nations vote. Last vote was 184 to two against them. United States and Israel. Israel\u2019s a satellite, it has to vote with the United States."

Other countries won\u2019t violate US sanctions, even though they oppose them and hate them, because they understand international affairs. They understand that the United States is a violent, rogue state, we should do what it wants. Do I have to run through the history on that?",
    "output": "Bill Fletcher Jr.:No, you obviously don\u2019t. But Germany had substantial business dealings with Russia. Right. Bill Fletcher Jr.:France was not interested in some sort of European conflagration. All I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s one thing to go along with US policy when it\u2019s far afield. What we\u2019re dealing with Ukraine, though, was right in the face of the Germans, the French, and other Europeans. And the NATO countries, at least two of them, bigger ones, were saying they did not want Ukraine in. And they\u2019re saying other things too. They hate the Cuba sanctions. They hate the Iran sanctions. They hate lots of other things that the United States does, but they adhere to them because they\u2019re terrified of our violent rogue state. They adhere to them. So they oppose them. Now to get back to your question, if there had been anyone in the Kremlin with any resemblance to being a statesman, what they would\u2019ve done is quite different from what Putin and the hard men around him decided to do. They would\u2019ve exploited the opportunity to bring France and Germany into an agreement, pretty much along the line of Gorbachev\u2019s common European home, without military alliances. France and Germany, as you mentioned, have very good reasons to want to pursue this possibility. President Macron of France, actually, in a very limited way tried to pursue it with his abortive interchanges with Putin. Would\u2019ve been a very sensible thing to try to do. That requires statesmanship. Okay. Would it have worked? We don\u2019t know. Putin and his circle didn\u2019t try. They reached for the guns right away, the way other great powers do, like the United States. It was a criminal decision. And from their point of view, an utterly stupid decision. What Putin did was provide the United States, on a silver platter, the greatest gift it could imagine. It handed Germany and France over to the United States. Placed them deep in the US\u2019s pocket, now totally subordinate to the United States, when Russia\u2019s interest, including his interest, would\u2019ve been to try to draw them out of the US orbit and into a framework of the kind that Gorbachev outlined. Which was not new, incidentally. major issue right through the Cold War since the Second World War has been, what will be the status of Europe? Will Europe be subordinate to the United States within the NATO framework, so-called Atlanticist framework? Or will Europe become an independent force in world affairs along the lines that the goal outlined, as he put it, Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals with no military blocks? Basically Gorbachev\u2019s vision. And that\u2019s been on the table for 75 years. Major issue. The United States, of course, approves the NATO Atlanticist framework. Again, if there was a statesman in the Kremlin, they would\u2019ve explored the goal list, Gorbachev\u2019s vision of a European common home with no military alliances. Instead, what they did is reach for the revolver, carry out criminal aggression, severely harming themselves, giving the United States the greatest gift it could imagine. Going back to China and the United States, you can imagine a reason why neither of them, why they\u2019re both essentially following the same line, fight to the last Ukrainian and don\u2019t do anything to enhance the possibilities of peaceful settlement. In fact, undermine them, in the case of the United States, by backing Putin to the wall with no escape hatch. A plausible explanation for this joint stand of China and the United States is that they both see the evolving situation as pretty much to their advantage. In the Chinese case, it\u2019s driving Russia into becoming a subordinate to the Chinese growing system. China is developing a huge system of development loans extending through central Asia, incorporating South Asia, moving to Turkey soon, probably to central Europe, moving to Africa, to Southeast Asia, even to US domains in Latin America. If they can draw \u2013 Russia\u2019s already part of it, but if Russia can become a subordinate member of it, providing raw materials, heavy weapons \u2013 Its specialty \u2013 But nothing else as it declines, that\u2019s to China\u2019s advantage. What about the United States? Putin, in his criminal foolishness, gave the United States everything that American strategists could want, put Europe deep in the US\u2019s pocket, now they do whatever the United States says. In fact, they\u2019re going quite wild. Like in Italy, canceling lectures on Dostoevsky, kicking Russian cats out of an international cat conference. US hawks couldn\u2019t want anything more."

And I want to better understand what\u2019s going on in the Putin regime. You have talked quite eloquently about the criminality of the Putin regime. I\u2019m thinking about what Putin did to the Chechnyans. I\u2019m thinking about what was done with the Russian intervention in the Syrian uprising and the brutal bombings that the Russians were engaged in, and other kinds of activities. And in that sense, I see a line that goes from Chechnya to Ukraine that is not just about the role of the United States, except and insofar as perhaps competition. How do you look at that?",
    "output": "Chechnya was ugly, vicious, destructive, but it is within the Russian Federation. Ugly, we\u2019ve got plenty of examples. Take Syria. Syria, what was happening, it was criminal and murderous and destructive. But if we want to know the reasons, they\u2019re not obscure. The United States, France, Germany were supporting opposition forces, which by 2013, 2014 were mostly Jihadi forces, which were fighting against the recognized government of Syria. The government that has a seat in the United Nations and is internationally recognized, they were trying to overthrow it. That\u2019s a Russian ally. The CIA was providing advanced weapons to the opposition forces, advanced anti-tank weapons, which did stop the Assad armies. Quite predictably, it didn\u2019t take a genius to predict it. I did, many other people did. The Russians reacted. They came into the war, really for the first time, moved in to destroy the CIA-supplied anti-tank weapons. Then they went on to continue to support Assad\u2019s brutal, vicious effort to reconquer Syria, horrible atrocities and so on. Technically it\u2019s not criminal, certainly not illegal, but it\u2019s criminal in the moral sense, not in the legal sense. Well, that\u2019s [crosstalk] Syria. That\u2019s what happened in Syria. Bill Fletcher Jr.:Yeah. Well, I mean, if we had more time, I\u2019d like to go more into Syria, in part because I think that one of the things that you\u2019re discounting is that there was a real uprising in Syria. In Syria \u2013 Bill Fletcher Jr.:In Syria, there was a real uprising, and the US was very ambivalent about that uprising for a while. But I wanted to get... That could be for our next interview Noam, but for this one \u2013 You have to understand in Syria there was an uprising that was part of the Arab Spring. Bill Fletcher Jr.:Right. democratic reformist uprising. Assad crushed it with extreme violence led on to the civil war \u2013 Bill Fletcher Jr.:Correct. Yeah. ...In which gradually the Jihadi forces pretty much took over. You can debate the details. But by 2013, 2014, according to the most informed observers that I know, there was a largely Jihadi based opposition. Which the US was supporting, attempting to overthrow the government, a brutal, murderous government, responsible for most of the crimes, but happened to be the internationally recognized government, which is a Russian ally. So when it got to the point that the CIA was providing advanced weapons by 2015, not surprisingly, predictably the Russians move in to destroy them. Then it went on to the rest of the destruction of Syria. Is it pretty? No, it\u2019s very ugly. Nobody believes that the Russians are saints, but they are an imperial power, minor in comparison with the United States. As I said before as an economy, they\u2019re on a par with Italy and Spain. They have advanced weapons. We don\u2019t have to recall that Russia was invaded, virtually destroyed, twice in the 20th century by Germany alone. Now the idea of an advanced, a hostile military alliance run by the world\u2019s most powerful and indeed most aggressive state, which is providing in last September, enhancing its strategic and defense cooperation with Ukraine with a robust and exercise program in keeping with Ukraine\u2019s status as a NATO enhanced opportunities partner, serious threat to Russia translate [crosstalk]. Bill Fletcher Jr.:Is it really \u2013 ...China and Mexico. Bill Fletcher Jr.:Is it really a threat? I mean, we\u2019re talking about 2022. It\u2019s not 1941. I\u2019m talking about 2021. Bill Fletcher Jr.:Right. Okay. Right. So 2021. But is it really a threat? I mean, there\u2019s the likelihood of a massive land assault on Russia is about as likely as my going to the moon tomorrow. This is the 21st century, we\u2019re not talking about Operation Barbarossa of 1941. And Russia has the most nuclear weapons on this planet."

    "input": "I mean, one of the concerns, Noam, is that when we talk about security and this concern for Russian security, I start wondering, well, who\u2019s concerned about Ukrainian security? And who\u2019s concerned about the security of the countries that are bordering on Russia that seem to have been in a complete panic after the Soviet Union collapse. Where does that fit in terms of some sort of more comprehensive approach to security?",
    "output": "Let\u2019s take a look. There was no threat whatsoever to the security of Austria, Finland, the Baltic countries, Germany. The West is now euphoric about the fact that the Russian military is incapable of capturing cities 30 kilometers from its border. There was no threat to those countries expressed or conceivable. If you want to, there is a threat from the United States. Why do you think world opinion regards the United States as the most dangerous country in the world? The world opinion, overwhelmingly, nobody else is [crosstalk]. Okay. Bill Fletcher Jr.:Right. There\u2019s a reason for that. The United States does what it wants. Invaded Iraq, destroyed the country, killed hundreds of thousands of people, laid the basis for ethnic conflicts that are tearing the region apart, the basis for ISIS. Remember the Nuremberg tribunal. That\u2019s not foreign, back in history. Invasion of Afghanistan, not far back in history. The United States remains a violent power. We don\u2019t talk about it, but in the Global South, they can see that the United States right now, right at this moment is purposely, consciously enhancing some of the major criminal acts in the world right now. Right now, millions of Afghans, after 20 years of US invasion and destruction, right now millions of Afghans are facing literal starvation. There\u2019s food in the markets, there are people who have some money, but they have to watch their children starve because they can\u2019t go to the bank to get a little bit of money to buy food in the market. Why? Because the United States has stolen their money. Bill Fletcher Jr.:But Noam, see, I hear you and I\u2019m not here. That\u2019s just the very beginning. Bill Fletcher Jr.:I understand, but I\u2019m not here to defend the United States, as you well know. But what I am saying is that there are multiple imperial powers on this planet. Right. Bill Fletcher Jr.:Right. And one of the things about the alleged Russian fear of what was happening in the Ukraine is that up until 2014, Ukraine was not interested in getting into NATO. But when the Russians intervened in the internal affairs of Ukraine, grabbing Crimea, promoting the secessionist movements, those things changed. So all of a sudden you have, then, a growing sympathy, which is completely logical because the country is being torn apart. It\u2019s not pretty, but it\u2019s very logical. You\u2019re skipping what happened in 2014. In 2014, there was an uprising or coup, call it what you want, which threw out the elected government, parliamentary government, refused the offer of the president to have a referendum or a vote and caused him to flee the country and return to the country with direct US involvement. Do I have to repeat to you the leaked material about Victoria Nuland? Now our point person on Ukraine discussing secretly who we are going to work to bring to be the next president. Should it be Yats? Should it be somebody else? Direct US involvement to establish a government that would be pro US instead of the former pro Russian government. Well, Russia could have just stood by and clapped, as we could have stood by and clapped if a pro Chinese government was established in Mexico calling for a military alliance with China. I rather doubt that we would\u2019ve done that. You can decide. But Russia didn\u2019t do it. They moved in and supported the Eastern sections, mostly Russia oriented population, mixed population, and they moved to take Crimea for reasons that every strategic analyst understands. You want to go back to Chas Freeman? Yeah. He just described it. Every Western analyst understands it. Crimea, which incidentally is very pro Russian and accepted the annexation, Crimea is the base for the only Russian warm water port. They\u2019re not like the United States. Bill Fletcher Jr.:But it was Ukrainian territory, Noam."

And so I wanted to thank you. I wanted to ask you a final quick question, which is that there are many people in the US left that seem to feel that there\u2019s nothing that we can do about Putin\u2019s influence one way or another, and that we should not even try. Do you have recommendations on how we in the United States, particularly the left and progressives, should be looking at what to do?",
    "output": "First of all, as leftists, we should be opposed to all imperialism, should be opposed to overthrowing governments, to aggression and violence. And as human beings who are sensible and moral, we should concentrate our attention, energy, and activism on what we can do. Happens overwhelmingly to be the actions of our own government, which happens to be the leader in the world. World champion by far in opposing sovereignty, in aggression, in violence, and interference, in terrorism and so on. We should oppose Russian imitation of our actions. What can we do about it? Well, I think it\u2019s very clear. There are two options. The ones I mentioned before. One option is one we\u2019re adopting. Fight to the last Ukrainian, to quote Ambassador Freeman again. And ensure that the Russians out there, that Putin and his circle are backed up against the wall, no exit, no way out, therefore they\u2019ll have the basic option of destroying Ukraine and moving towards global war. That\u2019s one option, which happens to be the one we\u2019re following. There is another option. Abandon the policies, our official policies, those I quoted. Move towards accepting a status for Ukraine which is similar to Mexico, Austria, Finland for decades, move towards establishing that, withdraw the threats to Russia that are explicit in the policy statement I mentioned. Move towards some kind of Minsk II style arrangement for a high level of autonomy for the Eastern region, maybe within a federal settlement. Recognize the reality that, like it or not, Crimea is off the table, it\u2019s not a negotiating option now. That\u2019s ugly, but the alternative is to continue our efforts to destroy Ukraine and to move towards an international war. Those are the choices. World is not a pretty place. You don\u2019t have the choice of electing Martin Luther King as the head of every government. Bill Fletcher Jr.:Dr. Noam Chomsky, thank you very, very much for joining us. This has been delightful.

And I want to thank all of you for joining us this evening. I hope you enjoyed this as much as I did. And it\u2019s one of those things where I had at least another hour of questions and discussions and comments that I wanted to offer, but this was a good taste. This was good. And I\u2019m hoping you enjoy it. I\u2019m hoping that you will provide support to The Real News Network, that you will provide support to Convergence Magazine, get a subscription. That you will access different organizations that have sponsored this program. That you\u2019ll engage in discussions and activism against the various imperialist powers out there that bring us closer and closer to extinction. I want to thank you very much again.

And canceling programs that were working with Chinese scientists to identify potential viruses. So the US was singularly unprepared. It\u2019s a privatized society, very wealthy, with enormous advantages \u2014 far more than any other country \u2014 but it\u2019s in the stranglehold of private control. It doesn\u2019t have a universal health care system.... It\u2019s the ultimate neoliberal system, actually. Europe in many ways is worse, because the austerity programs just amplify the danger, because of the severe attack on democracy in Europe, the shifting decisions to Brussels.... So Europe has its own problems, but at least it has the residue of some kind of social democratic structure, which provides some support, which is what I think is lacking in the US. As severe as this pandemic is, it\u2019s not the worst problem. There will be recovery from the pandemic at severe cost ... but there isn\u2019t going to be any recovery from the melting of the polar ice caps and the rising of sea levels and the other deleterious effects of global warming."

    "input": "J. Polychroniou: President Joe Biden has been in office for approximately two months now, in the course of which he has signed scores of executive orders meant to reverse the policies of Donald Trump. But he has also managed to pass a huge and ambitious stimulus bill unlike anything seen during peacetime. What\u2019s your assessment of Biden\u2019s actions so far to deal with the most pressing issues facing U.S. society: namely, the coronavirus pandemic and the pain caused to millions of Americans on account of the pandemic?",
    "output": "Better than I\u2019d anticipated. Considerably so. The stimulus bill has its flaws, but considering the circumstances, it\u2019s an impressive achievement. The circumstances are a highly disciplined opposition party dedicated to the principle announced years ago by its maximal leader, Mitch McConnell:If we are not in power, we must render the country ungovernable and block government legislative efforts, however beneficial they might be.Then the consequences can be blamed on the party in power, and we can take over.It worked well for Republicans in 2009 \u2014 with plenty of help from Obama. By 2010, the Democrats lost Congress, and the way was cleared to the 2016 debacle. There\u2019s every reason to suppose that the strategy will be renewed \u2014 this time under more complex circumstances. The voting base in the hands of Trump, who shares the objective but differs from McConnell on who will pick up the pieces: McConnell and the donor class, or Trump and the voting base he mobilized, almost half of whom worship him as the messenger God sent to save the country from ... we can fill in our favorite fantasies, but should not overlook the fact that what may sound [ridiculous] has roots in the lives of the victims of the neoliberal globalization of the past 40 years \u2014 extended by Trump, apart from some rhetorical flourishes. In those circumstances, passing a stimulus bill was a major accomplishment. Republicans who favor it, and know that their constituents do, nevertheless voted against it, in lockstep obedience to what the Central Committee determines. Some Democrats insisted on watering it down. But what finally passed has valuable elements, which could be a basis for moving on. There are huge gaps. The bill surely should have contained an increase in the miserable minimum wage, an utter scandal. But that would have been very difficult in the face of total Republican opposition, along with a few Democrats. And there are other crucial features that are missing. Nevertheless, if the short-term measures on child poverty, income support, medical insurance and other basic needs can be extended, it would be a substantial step toward fulfilling the promise envisioned by such careful observers as Roosevelt Institute President Felicia Wong, who reflected that, \u201cAs I see it, both the scale and the direction of the American Rescue Plan break the neoliberal, deficits-and-inflation-come-first mold that has hollowed out our economy for a generation.\u201d We haven\u2019t seen anything that could elicit such hopes for a long time."

Who would have imagined that a regular contributor to radical economics journals would be appointed to the Council of Economic Advisers (Heather Boushey), joined by the senior economic adviser of the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute, (Jared Bernstein)?",
    "output": "Biden\u2019s strong support for Amazon workers, and unions generally, is a welcome shift. Nothing like it has been heard from the chambers of power in many years. In a sharp reversal of Trump legislation, the tax changes raise incomes mostly for the poor, not the rich. Economic Policy Institute President Thea Lee summarizes the package by saying that it \u201cwill provide crucial support to millions of working families; dramatically reduce the race, gender, and income inequalities that were exacerbated by the crisis; and create the conditions for a truly robust recovery once the virus is under control and people are able to resume normal economic activity.\u201d Optimistic, but within reach. House Democrats have passed other important legislation. H.R. 1 protects voting rights, a critical matter now, with Republicans working overtime to try to block the votes of [people of color] and the poor, recognizing that this is the only way a minority party dedicated to wealth and corporate power can remain viable. On the labor front, the House passed the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, \u201ca critical step toward restoring workers\u2019 right to organize and bargain collectively,\u201d the Economic Policy Institute reports, a fundamental right that \u201chas been eroded for decades as employers exploited weaknesses in the current law.\u201d It\u2019ll probably be killed by the Senate. Even apart from party loyalty, there is little sympathy for working people in Republican ranks. But even so, it\u2019s a basis for organizing and education. It can be a step toward revitalizing the labor movement, a prime target of the neoliberal project since Reagan and Thatcher, who understood well that working people must be deprived of means to defend themselves from the assault. Decline of union membership is by now recognized, even in the mainstream, to be a major factor in rising inequality \u2014 a phrase that translates to \u201crobbery of the general public by a tiny fraction of super-rich.\u201d The Economic Policy Institute has reviewed the facts regularly, most recently in a chart that graphically demonstrates the remarkable correlation between rising/falling union membership and falling/rising inequality. More generally, there is a good opportunity to overcome the baleful legacy of Trump\u2019s bitterly anti-labor Labor Department, headed by corporate lawyer Eugene Scalia, who used his term in office to eviscerate worker rights, notoriously during the pandemic. Scalia was perfectly chosen for the transformation of the Republicans to a \u201cworking-class party,\u201d as hailed by Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley in a triumph of propaganda, or maybe sheer chutzpah. Michael Regan\u2019s appointment as Environmental Protection Agency administrator should replace corporate greed by science and human welfare in this essential agency, a move toward human decency that in this case is a prerequisite for survival. It\u2019s easy to find serious omissions and deficiencies in Biden\u2019s programs on the domestic front, but there are signs of hope for emerging from the Trump nightmare and moving on to what really should, what really must be done. The hopes are, however, conditional. The temporary measures of the stimulus on child poverty and many other issues must be made permanent, and improved. Crucially, activist pressure must not cease. The masters of the universe pursue their class war relentlessly, and can only be countered by an aroused public opposition that is no less dedicated to the common good."

    "output": "One reason is objective reality. The sharp rise in inequality is a growing curse, with extremely harmful effects across the society. As mentioned earlier, it closely tracks decline of unions, for reasons that are well understood. Historically, labor unions have been in the forefront of struggles for justice and rights. They also pioneered the environmental movement, as we\u2019ve discussed before. Workers\u2019 organizations are changing in character with the growth of service and knowledge-based economies. They have shared interests, and foster the values of solidarity and mutual aid on which the hope for a decent future rest. Many unions retain the world \u201cinternational\u201d in their names. It should not just be a symbol or a dream. The dire challenges we face have no borders. Global heating, pandemics, disarmament will be dealt with internationally, if at all. The same is true of labor rights and human rights more generally. At every level, associations of working people should once again be prominent, if not leading the way, toward a better world.

Or, on the other side of the argument, that this is exactly the time to raise all those other types of issues and to be tough on Biden. How do you understand that debate?",
    "output": "NOAM Well, there is a traditional left position, which has been pretty much forgotten, unfortunately, but it\u2019s the one I think we should adhere to. That\u2019s the position that real politics is constant activism. It\u2019s quite different from the establishment position, which says politics means focus, laser-like, on the quadrennial extravaganza, then go home and let your superiors take over. The left position has always been: You\u2019re working all the time, and every once in a while there\u2019s an event called an election. This should take you away from real politics for 10 or 15 minutes. Then you go back to work. At this moment, the difference between the candidates is a chasm. There has never been a greater difference. It should be obvious to anyone who\u2019s not living under a rock. So the traditional left position says, \u201cTake the 15 minutes, push the lever, go back to work.\u201d Now, the activist left has not been making the choice that you mentioned. It\u2019s been doing both. Take Biden\u2019s campaign positions. Farther to the left than any Democratic candidate in memory on things like climate. It\u2019s far better than anything that preceded it. Not because Biden had a personal conversion or the DNC had some great insight, but because they\u2019re being hammered on by activists coming out of the Sanders movement and others. The climate program, a $2 trillion commitment to dealing with the extreme threat of environmental catastrophe, was largely written by the Sunrise Movement and strongly endorsed by the leading activists on climate change, the ones who managed to get the Green New Deal on the legislative agenda. That\u2019s real politics. ANAND This is interesting coming from you. Your support for Biden is more than merely grudging. You actually seem to think that the platform is surprisingly good given who he is and given where we are. NOAM This is not support for Biden. It is support for the activists who have been at work constantly, creating the background within the party in which the shifts took place, and who have followed Sanders in actually entering the campaign and influencing it. Support for them. Support for real politics. The left position is you rarely support anyone. You vote against the worst. You keep the pressure and activism going. ANAND So given this popular ferment you\u2019re talking about, a question about a leader. I wonder whether you think a figure like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could ever become president in this country. NOAM Well, if you\u2019d asked me 10 years ago whether someone like Bernie Sanders could be the most popular political figure in the country, I would\u2019ve said you\u2019re out of your mind. But it in fact happened in 2016 and it\u2019s continued to create a significant movement. There are real possibilities. I think if you take a look at the United States in the 1920s, and you asked, Could there ever be a labor movement?, you would\u2019ve sounded crazy. How could there be? It had been crushed. But it changed. Human life is not predictable. Depends on choices and will, which are unpredictable. So right now, for example, we\u2019re in the process of formation of a Progressive International. It\u2019s based on the Sanders movement in the United States and Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s DiEM25 movement in Europe, which is a transnational European movement seeking to preserve and strengthen what makes sense in the European Union and to overcome its very serious flaws. If you ask now whether it\u2019s a prospect, it would be very hard. If you take a look at it objectively, you look at where power is distributed in the world, you\u2019ve got the Progressive International made up of these forces, and then you have a \u201creactionary international\u201d being crafted in the White House with Trump running it. Quasi-dictators like Bolsonaro, a Trump clone, are part of it. The Middle Eastern dictators, family dictators of the Gulf states. Sisi\u2019s Egypt, the worst dictatorship in Egyptian history. Israel, which is moving so far to the right you can barely see it, is part of it. Modi\u2019s India, trying to destroy Indian democracy, turn it into a fundamentalist Hindu quasi-dictatorship. Orban in Hungary. You compare those forces, and it looks like, How could this even be a struggle? But that\u2019s the wrong measure. There are people, and they make a difference. We can go back to my favorite philosopher, David Hume. HisOf the First Principles of Government, a political tract in the late 18th century, starts off by saying that we should understand that power is in the hands of the governed. Those who are governed, they\u2019re the ones who have the power. Whatever kind of state it is, militaristic or more democratic, as England was becoming. The masters rule only by consent. And if consent is withdrawn, they lose. Their rule is very fragile. I should say that today\u2019s masters of the universe, as they modestly call themselves, understand this very well. Every January in Davos, the Switzerland ski resort, the great and powerful gather to go skiing, enjoy themselves, and congratulate each other on how wonderful they are. Top CEOs and media figures and entertainment figures and so on. But this year was different. The theme was different. The theme was:We\u2019re in trouble. The peasants are coming with their pitchforks.As they would prefer to put it, we\u2019re facing \u201creputational risks.\u201dThey\u2019re coming after us. Our control is fragile. We have to provide a different message.So the message at Davos was:Yes, we realize we\u2019ve done wrong things during this whole neoliberal period. You, the general population, have suffered. We understand that. We\u2019re overcoming our mistakes. We\u2019re now going to be committed to you, the stakeholders and working-class communities, we\u2019re really committed to your welfare. We\u2019re becoming deeply humanitarian. We regret our mistakes. You can put your faith in us. We\u2019ll take over and work for your benefit. ANAND"

The fact that that series appeared is already a great substantial sign of the change in awareness and consciousness. Couple of years ago, that would\u2019ve been inconceivable.

Now that there\u2019s been conversation and further debate and more context around what that whole thing was, what is your sense of it?",
    "output": "NOAM Well, there\u2019s two different things. There\u2019s the letter and there\u2019s the discussion. The letter is anodyne. It\u2019s a simple statement that it\u2019s worth being careful to preserve freedom of speech. The main attack on freedom of speech was not discussed there. It\u2019s the mainstream establishment, which for years has been engaged in massive cancel culture. But now segments of the left are picking up part of the same pathology. It\u2019s harmful; they shouldn\u2019t be doing it; it\u2019s wrong in principle. It\u2019s suicidal. It\u2019s a gift to the far right. So here\u2019s a quiet statement saying, \u201cLook, we should be careful about these things and not undertake this.\u201d Should\u2019ve been the end. Then comes the reaction, which is extremely interesting. It proves that the problem was much deeper than was assumed. The reaction is pretty hysterical, mostly totally irrational. Sensible people, personal friends of mine, are writing articles attacking the statement because of the people who signed it. Just think what that means for a second. I\u2019m sure you, like any other person who\u2019s well-known, are deluged with requests to sign statements on human rights issues, civil liberties issues, and so on. Do you take account of who the signers are going to be? You can\u2019t. You can\u2019t know who the signers are going to be. If this position of the critics were adopted, there would never be a statement. Nobody in his right mind would sign a statement if the content of the statement is going to be judged by who might sign it tomorrow. This criticism is much to the pleasure of the right wing, which hates these statements. So it\u2019s another massive service to the right wing. Just as breaking up a meeting of somebody you don\u2019t like is a service to the right wing. You want to play their game? Do it straight. Don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re on the left. ANAND How do you think the left could do a better job in terms of the language it uses, the political appeals it makes, at reaching a broader group of people who are not hardcore? It often feels like Republicans are very gifted at making people vote for things that are not good for them and Democrats struggle to make people vote for things that would be very, very good for them. NOAM Well, actually, the Sanders movement was remarkably successful. And it\u2019s something that has broken with over 100 years of American political history. To bring a candidate to near nomination without any support from the media, from big donors, from the corporate sector. Nothing like that\u2019s happened before. Could it do more? I think so. Not to make a big fuss about it, but I\u2019ve been mildly critical of Sanders\u2019 presenting himself as a socialist. He\u2019s not a socialist in my opinion. He\u2019s a New Deal Democrat. A mild social democrat. His policies would not have surprised Eisenhower very much. It\u2019s a sign of the shift to the right, of both parties, during the neoliberal period, that his positions are considered revolutionary. What\u2019s the point of calling himself socialist? That\u2019s a scary word in the United States. The U.S. is an unusual society. In every other country in the world, a socialist is kind of like a Democrat. Somebody\u2019s a socialist, fine. You can be a communist and be right in the political system. The United States is an extreme, business-run society with a very rigid set of controls. So words like socialist are scare words. Means the gulag. Communist, you can\u2019t even mention. All right, those are realities about the United States. We should do something about them. But you\u2019re not going to unravel them in time for an election, OK? So, in my view, it\u2019s a dubious stand to take. ANAND You mentioned the 1619 Project. One of the things that it seems to bring out in its detractors is this fear that, if you tell the truth about the origins of the country and 400 years of repression, you\u2019re stealing the grounds for their patriotism. You\u2019re taking away their sense that their country is right and good."

It takes place step by step, small changes to bigger ones, and so on. The absence of a continued left tradition in the United States is very harmful in this respect. Everything starts new. Things begin, they\u2019re important, they dissipate. Serious organizers in poor communities understand that the first thing they have to do is break through the sense of hopelessness. And there are ways of doing that. Take the antiwar movement, Vietnam. I myself got involved in it in 1961, when Kennedy started escalating the war. Nobody was interested. It looked totally hopeless. The first talks that were given were literally in somebody\u2019s living room. Couple of neighbors. Or a church with half a dozen people. Within a couple of years, there was a mass popular movement. Way too late, but it did develop, and it had an impact. It\u2019s very possible, as Dan Ellsberg and others have argued, that it prevented Nixon from using nuclear weapons.

As you\u2019ve watched the rise of social media, I wonder how you think social media has altered the power equations of the country. In what ways do you see it diffusing power? In what ways has it concentrated power further?",
    "output": "NOAM Social media, like most technologies, are pretty neutral. What matters is how you use them. You can use a hammer to build a house; you can use a hammer to smash somebody\u2019s head in. Social media are being used in very different ways. They\u2019re used to organize activists, set up demonstrations, to give people the opportunity to interact, think, develop opinions, deliberate. But they can also be used to drive people into bubbles in which you hear only the same thing over and over. Your prejudices get reinforced, and you hate everybody else. They can be used either way. And they are being used both ways. So the question comes back to us: How are we going to use the technology that\u2019s available? It doesn\u2019t care. We can use it any way we like. The net effect of social media probably, by and large, I suspect, has been mostly negative. Doesn\u2019t have to be, but I think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s turned out. So, for example, a lot of young people now get their news from Facebook. What\u2019s Facebook giving you? Facebook doesn\u2019t have reporters in the field. The bookManufacturing Consent, which you mentioned, has often been misunderstood. It\u2019s not saying the media don\u2019t tell you the truth. In fact, much of the book is devoted to defense of the media. Reporters tell the truth. They\u2019re serious, they\u2019re courageous, they\u2019re honest. They do it within a framework which restricts and constrains and shapes what they\u2019re doing. But if you want to know what\u2019s going on in the world, it\u2019s much better to read The New York Times in the morning than to look at what filters its way down to Facebook. ANAND Because of the pandemic and the related crises, the issues you have spent your life talking about are really at the fore of the discourse today. They\u2019re in politics; they\u2019re in activism; they\u2019re unavoidable.

NOAM I don\u2019t really think about a legacy. What I\u2019m interested in is the people who are doing things. Mostly their names will never be known. I\u2019m sure you can\u2019t tell me, or I can\u2019t tell you, the names of the kids who sat in at the lunch counter in Greensboro. These are the people who carry things forward. If there\u2019s a legacy of people who try to do what they can to stimulate it, it\u2019s theirs. The ones I most respect in the world, I can\u2019t remember their names. People in refugee camps in Laos. The peasants in southern Colombia trying to stave off paramilitary attacks and protect themselves from corporations that want to destroy their water supply with gold mines. People in Kurdish areas in Turkey. I\u2019ll give you an example. At the peak of the Turkish repression of the Kurds, it was very vicious. It was worst in the 1990s. It was strongly supported by Clinton. He was pouring arms in the worse the oppression got. I happened to be there at the tail end of it. I gave a talk. You were not allowed to speak Kurdish. It was a crime. You could disappear and never be seen again. I was cautious in the talk not to arouse too much ire of the security people. At the end of my talk, four kids came up holding a big book and gave it to me. It was a Kurdish-Turkish dictionary. They were saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to struggle on.\u201d I don\u2019t know what happened to them. But it\u2019s people like that all over the world whom you can really respect. They\u2019re the ones who matter for any legacy that emerges."

Polychroniou: Noam, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has taken most people by surprise, sending shockwaves throughout the world, although there were plenty of indications that Putin had become quite agitated by NATO\u2019s expansion eastward and Washington\u2019s refusal to take seriously his \u201cred line\u201d security demands regarding Ukraine. Why do you think he decided to launch an invasion at this point in time?",
    "output": "Before turning to the question, we should settle a few facts that are uncontestable. The most crucial one is that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a major war crime, ranking alongside the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the Hitler-Stalin invasion of Poland in September 1939, to take only two salient examples. It always makes sense to seek explanations, but there is no justification, no extenuation. Turning now to the question, there are plenty of supremely confident outpourings about Putin\u2019s mind. The usual story is that he is caught up in paranoid fantasies, acting alone, surrounded by groveling courtiers of the kind familiar here in what\u2019s left of the Republican Party traipsing to Mar-a-Lago for the Leader\u2019s blessing. The flood of invective might be accurate, but perhaps other possibilities might be considered. Perhaps Putin meant what he and his associates have been saying loud and clear for years. It might be, for example, that, \u201cSince Putin\u2019s major demand is an assurance that NATO will take no further members, and specifically not Ukraine or Georgia, obviously there would have been no basis for the present crisis if there had been no expansion of the alliance following the end of the Cold War, or if the expansion had occurred in harmony with building a security structure in Europe that included Russia.\u201d The author of these words is former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Jack Matlock, one of the few serious Russia specialists in the U.S. diplomatic corps, writing shortly before the invasion. He goes on to conclude that the crisis \u201ccan be easily resolved by the application of common sense.... By any common-sense standard it is in the interest of the United States to promote peace, not conflict. To try to detach Ukraine from Russian influence \u2014 the avowed aim of those who agitated for the \u2018color revolutions\u2019 \u2014 was a fool\u2019s errand, and a dangerous one. Have we so soon forgotten the lesson of the Cuban Missile Crisis?\u201d Matlock is hardly alone. Much the same conclusions about the underlying issues are reached in the memoirs of CIA head William Burns, another of the few authentic Russia specialists. [Diplomat] George Kennan\u2019s even stronger stand has belatedly been widely quoted, backed as well by former Defense Secretary William Perry, and outside the diplomatic ranks by the noted international relations scholar John Mearsheimer and numerous other figures who could hardly be more mainstream. None of this is obscure. U.S. internal documents, released byWikiLeaks, reveal that Bush II\u2019s reckless offer to Ukraine to join NATO at once elicited sharp warnings from Russia that the expanding military threat could not be tolerated. Understandably. We might incidentally take note of the strange concept of \u201cthe left\u201d that appears regularly in excoriation of \u201cthe left\u201d for insufficient skepticism about the \u201cKremlin\u2019s line.\u201d The fact is, to be honest, that we do not know why the decision was made, even whether it was made by Putin alone or by the Russian Security Council in which he plays the leading role. There are, however, some things we do know with fair confidence, including the record reviewed in some detail by those just cited, who have been in high places on the inside of the planning system. In brief, the crisis has been brewing for 25 years as the U.S. contemptuously rejected Russian security concerns, in particular their clear red lines: Georgia and especially Ukraine. There is good reason to believe that this tragedy could have been avoided, until the last minute. We\u2019ve discussed it before, repeatedly. As to why Putin launched the criminal aggression right now, we can speculate as we like. But the immediate background is not obscure \u2014 evaded but not contested. It\u2019s easy to understand why those suffering from the crime may regard it as an unacceptable indulgence to inquire into why it happened and whether it could have been avoided. Understandable, but mistaken. If we want to respond to the tragedy in ways that will help the victims, and avert still worse catastrophes that loom ahead, it is wise, and necessary, to learn as much as we can about what went wrong and how the course could have been corrected. Heroic gestures may be satisfying. They are not helpful. As often before, I\u2019m reminded of a lesson I learned long ago. In the late 1960s, I took part in a meeting in Europe with a few representatives of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (\u201cViet Cong,\u201d in U.S. parlance). It was during the brief period of intense opposition to the horrendous U.S. crimes in Indochina. Some young people were so infuriated that they felt that only a violent reaction would be an appropriate response to the unfolding monstrosities: breaking windows on Main Street, bombing an ROTC center. Anything less amounted to complicity in terrible crimes. The Vietnamese saw things very differently. They strongly opposed all such measures. They presented their model of an effective protest: a few women standing in silent prayer at the graves of U.S. soldiers killed in Vietnam. They were not interested in what made American opponents of the war feel righteous and honorable. They wanted to survive. It\u2019s a lesson I\u2019ve often heard in one or another form from victims of hideous suffering in the Global South, the prime target of imperial violence. One we should take to heart, adapted to circumstances. Today that means an effort to understand why this tragedy occurred and what could have been done to avert it, and to apply these lessons to what comes next. The question cuts deep. There is no time to review this critically important matter here, but repeatedly the reaction to real or imagined crisis has been to reach for the six-gun rather than the olive branch. It\u2019s almost a reflex, and the consequences have generally been awful \u2014 for the traditional victims. It\u2019s always worthwhile to try to understand, to think a step or two ahead about the likely consequences of action or inaction. Truisms of course, but worth reiterating, because they are so easily dismissed in times of justified passion. The options that remain after the invasion are grim. The least bad is support for the diplomatic options that still exist, in the hope of reaching an outcome not too far from what was very likely achievable a few days ago: Austrian-style neutralization of Ukraine, some version of Minsk II federalism within. Much harder to reach now. And \u2014 necessarily \u2014 with an escape hatch for Putin, or outcomes will be still more dire for Ukraine and everyone else, perhaps almost unimaginably so."

And we should also try to find ways to help a much broader class of victims: all life on Earth. This catastrophe took place at a moment where all of the great powers, indeed all of us, must be working together to control the great scourge of environmental destruction that is already exacting a grim toll, with much worse soon to come unless major efforts are undertaken quickly. To drive home the obvious, the IPCC just released the latest and by far most ominous of its regular assessments of how we are careening to catastrophe. Meanwhile, the necessary actions are stalled, even driven into reverse, as badly needed resources are devoted to destruction and the world is now on a course to expand the use of fossil fuels, including the most dangerous and conveniently abundant of them, coal. more grotesque conjuncture could hardly be devised by a malevolent demon. It can\u2019t be ignored. Every moment counts."

Yet Putin sought to offer legal justifications for the invasion during his speech on February 24, and Russia cites Kosovo, Iraq, Libya and Syria as evidence that the United States and its allies violate international law repeatedly. Can you comment on Putin\u2019s legal justifications for the invasion of Ukraine and on the status of international law in the post-Cold War era?",
    "output": "There is nothing to say about Putin\u2019s attempt to offer legal justification for his aggression. Its merit is zero. Of course, it is true that the U.S. and its allies violate international law without a blink of an eye, but that provides no extenuation for Putin\u2019s crimes. Kosovo, Iraq and Libya did, however, have direct implications for the conflict over Ukraine. The Iraq invasion was a textbook example of the crimes for which Nazis were hanged at Nuremberg, pure unprovoked aggression. And a punch in Russia\u2019s face. In the case of Kosovo, NATO aggression (meaning U.S. aggression) was claimed to be \u201cillegal but justified\u201d (for example, by the International Commission on Kosovo chaired by Richard Goldstone) on grounds that the bombing was undertaken to terminate ongoing atrocities. That judgment required reversal of the chronology. The evidence is overwhelming that the flood of atrocities was the consequence of the invasion: predictable, predicted, anticipated. Furthermore, diplomatic options were available, [but] as usual, ignored in favor of violence. High U.S. officials confirm that it was primarily the bombing of Russian ally Serbia \u2014 without even informing them in advance \u2014 that reversed Russian efforts to work together with the U.S. somehow to construct a post-Cold War European security order, a reversal accelerated with the invasion of Iraq and the bombing of Libya after Russia agreed not to veto a UN Security Council Resolution that NATO at once violated. Events have consequences; however, the facts may be concealed within the doctrinal system. The status of international law did not change in the post-Cold War period, even in words, let alone actions. President Clinton made it clear that the U.S. had no intention of abiding by it. The Clinton Doctrine declared that the U.S. reserves the right to act \u201cunilaterally when necessary,\u201d including \u201cunilateral use of military power\u201d to defend such vital interests as \u201censuring uninhibited access to key markets, energy supplies and strategic resources.\u201d His successors as well, and anyone else who can violate the law with impunity. That\u2019s not to say that international law is of no value. It has a range of applicability, and it is a useful standard in some respects."

However, no matter what happens, Ukraine is facing a daunting future for its decision to become a pawn in Washington\u2019s geostrategic games. In that context, how likely is it that economic sanctions will cause Russia to change its stance toward Ukraine \u2014 or do the economic sanctions aim at something bigger, such as undermining Putin\u2019s control inside Russia and ties with countries such as Cuba, Venezuela and possibly even China itself?",
    "output": "Ukraine may not have made the most judicious choices, but it had nothing like the options available to the imperial states. I suspect that the sanctions will drive Russia to even greater dependency on China. Barring a serious change of course, Russia is a kleptocratic petrostate relying on a resource that must decline sharply or we are all finished. It\u2019s not clear whether its financial system can weather a sharp attack, through sanctions or other means. All the more reason to offer an escape hatch with a grimace."

    "output": "I also wanted to ask about the history of a book that had impacted many young reporters, including myself once upon a time. Why had a non-journalist ventured into this topic? I asked the same question about his co-author, Wharton School professor Ed Herman, who sadly passed away last year. About Herman: one of the first things Chomsky mentioned is that the \u201cpropaganda model\u201d was \u201ca little more his than mine,\u201d which is why he insisted that the book\u2019s byline read Herman/Chomsky, and not Chomsky/Herman. As it turned out, the book had a bit of a strange history, and he seemed to enjoy recounting it. We ended up talking about the future of the news media, and about the immediate political future. There is a whole literature of reporters running to Chomsky in search of scare quotes about how this time, things are really bad \u2013 and coming away disappointed when Chomsky answers, with a shrug, that, no, things have always been this crazy, just remember X and Y and Z... That drives reporters nuts. Particularly in the Trump era, when there\u2019s constant pressure in the media business to scrape up a ten-alarm quote about how whatever lunatic thing Trump did today is the Worst Thing Ever, Chomsky has been a constant disappointment to the popular press. He keeps telling reporters that Trump\u2019s daily insanities are a distraction, and the real problems involve his administration\u2019s dismantling of regulatory systems, its failure to focus on global warming, and its worsening of the threat of nuclear war. These are all things that, while historically awful, mostly happen behind closed doors, away from the headlines. The world could use a little more of whatever well of equanimity he\u2019s drinking from. In any case, here\u2019s Noam Chomsky on the media\u2019s past, present, and future: Taibbi: Professor, it\u2019s a great honor. Thanks so much for the time. Thank you. Taibbi: I want to talkManufacturing Consent,a book that had a huge influence on reporters like myself. Sure. Taibbi: What was the genesis of that project? How did you decide to do a treatment of the media? Neither of you specialized in the subject. Well, the first book we wrote had a very interesting history. It was calledCounter-Revolutionary Violence. There was a small, but quite successful, publisher that was publishing this. It was largely doing materials for universities, small monographs and things. One of them was this one we wrote, calledCounter-Revolutionary Violence. They published 20,000 copies, and started advertising. But it turned out the company was owned by Warner Brothers. And one of the executives in Warner Brothers saw the ads, and didn\u2019t like it."

Well, we said, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s gone.\u201d But we decided to expand it. The next major book that we did together was a two-volumePolitical Economy of Human Rights, which came out in 1979. And it was around that time that we started working on looking at how the media handled things. And that led us to finallyManufacturing Consent. Ed, as you may know, was a professor of finance. And his main work, his academic work, was calledCorporate Power, Corporate Control, which is a standard text on corporate power. But he\u2019s pretty left wing, so it was critical.

If I were doing it, I would have just given some examples. But when he did it, he did all of the statistics, and got the charts correct, and so on. The main part that I wrote myself was mostly the Indochina part, and the parts on the Freedom House attack on the media. This is a part that people don\u2019t really recognize, that a large part of the book was adefenseof the media. It was actually a defense of the media from the attacks of organizations like Freedom House.* Taibbi: Right. But it\u2019s kind of interesting that journalists didn\u2019t like that defense. And the reason was \u2013 part of it first came out in an article of mine in a journal that was short lived, critical journalism review** that was run by Anthony Lukas, kind of a critical journalist, very cool. I wrote a long article in it about the two-volume Freedom House thing. What we basically argued is that the journalists are doing honest, courageous work that\u2019s professional, and serious. And in lot of difficult circumstances, they do a very good job. But they\u2019re all doing it within a framework of, an ideological framework, which is reflects the dominant hegemonic common sense.

Whereas in fact, it\u2019s exactly in accord with their principles and values. The idea that they were not courageous tribunes of the people flaunting doctrine and so on was unpalatable.

    "output": "Probably when I was 10 years old! Actually remember, the work that I had done on my own before this was a critique of the intellectual culture. And my own view, Ed and I slightly differed here, is that the media aren\u2019t all that different from the general intellectual culture, the academic culture. So the effect of the institutions: ownership, advertising, and so on, that\u2019s all there. But an overriding effect is just the way the general hegemonic culture works, and you see that in the academic world. You see it in scholarship, and you see it in a very striking way in the media. But it\u2019s much easier to study in the media. Academic scholarship is diffuse. You can\u2019t do statistical analysis of how many articles there were on this, and that sort of thing. So it\u2019s kind of focused on the media, and sharpened, then it\u2019s influenced of course by the filters that we talked about. But I think riding through it is something that you see through the intellectual culture generally. In fact, the work that I\u2019d done back in the sixties and on, it was mostly about that, continuing to the present. It\u2019s mostly about general academic intellectual culture. Which does show up in the media in a very striking form, and that\u2019s why we incidentally kept it to the elite media. So we talked about theNew York Times,Washington Post, CBS. We didn\u2019t talk about the tabloids. Taibbi: But basically you\u2019re talking about the same instinct for conformity, the inability to understand that you\u2019re working within a predetermined framework. It was exactly what you said before. It\u2019s the assumption that you\u2019re being adversarial, independent, questioning everything, and so on. But it\u2019s the same in scholarship. If you tell a scholar, \u201cLook you\u2019re just conforming to ideological prejudices,\u201d they go crazy. You can see what happened when something really became prominent that questioned the basic ideological framework. Like when Howard Zinn\u2019s book... Taibbi: ThePeople\u2019s History of the United States. Right. When that became popular, historians just went berserk. There\u2019s a very interesting book that just came out about that, you want to take a look. Taibbi: Is there? I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s calledZinnophobia... It\u2019s very careful analysis of Oscar Handlin, and all the guys who bitterly attacked the Zinn report. Taibbi: Well, that gets to one of the other themes of your book:flak. Right. This is it. In the intellectual culture. Of course there\u2019s plenty of it. Taibbi: Have you thought over the years about what parts of the propaganda model have held up more than others? Clearlyflakis one that has."

Here, Chomsky is talking about how other theologies have entered the scene since 1988.) It\u2019s got to be broader than that. Anti-communism was a salient illustration of the enemy that you construct to justify everything you\u2019re doing, But it could be terrorism, it could be anything. Taibbi: Populism is another one.

Not by society. So it\u2019s really saying we\u2019re exposed, we have to try to live up to these ideals. He didn\u2019t say we were doing it, by any means. In fact, he knew we weren\u2019t.

It presents an image of a country that is completely deluded, and bloodthirsty, and it has this terrible history it can\u2019t face up to. We had much more of that in thePolitical Economy of Human Rights, which wasn\u2019t about the media. It was partly about the media, but it was mainly about the actions. That was just an anathema. Nobody could even look atthat. Which was pretty striking, because the most \u2013 well, it was pretty interesting. There was an interesting reaction to those two volumes. If you look at them, we covered a lot of ground, but the focus was on two cases. One of them was East Timor. The other was Cambodia under Pol Pot. Those are two places, same region of the world, during the same years, both huge massacres. East Timor was probably worse. There was only one difference between them. In one case, you could blame it on someone else. In the other case, we were doing it. Taibbi: Right. And what we pointed out is that in both cases, there\u2019s massive lying but in opposite directions. In the Cambodia cases, there were all kinds of claims that there was no basis for. When things were refuted, they got elaborated upon and continued. Any invention is okay. On the East Timor case, there appeared to be either ignoring, or pure denial. And of course the East Timor case is far more important, because that we could have stopped at any time. Because we were crucially responsible for it. And in fact that was proven when finally 25 years later under a lot of domestic and international pressure, Clinton was pressured to tell the Indonesians to call it off. And he basically told them, \u201cLook, the game\u2019s over,\u201d and they pulled out a minute later. But it could have been done for 25 years. So the East Timor case was vastly more important. Basically the same story, but lying in opposite directions and phenomenal, actually phenomenal lying in both cases. Take a look at the reaction to the book. The East Timor thing had never been mentioned. The Cambodia thing, everybody went berserk. They said, we\u2019re protecting Pol Pot, we\u2019re defending genocide. No. We were simply saying, if American intelligence probably has the story correct, than the stuff that you guys are publishing is crazed lies. It would have impressed Stalin. So there\u2019s a huge literature attacking us, usually me, on Cambodia, and total silence on East Timor."

It\u2019s such a perfect choice of topic. If a PR person had invented it, they couldn\u2019t have made it better. So everyone loved it and it won prizes, and it\u2019s wonderful. But there\u2019s nothing about any of our crimes. I think she mentions East Timor, and she says, \u201cWe made a mistake in East Timor. We looked away.\u201d Looked away? We gave the green light to go ahead, provided the arms, backed them all the time. (Note: East Timor\u2019s Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in 2006 concluded that America\u2019s \u201cpolitical and military support were fundamental to the Indonesian invasion and occupation,\u201d which led to the deaths of at least 100,000 people.) That all happened, but the most you can say is that \u201cwe looked away\u201d in East Timor. Taibbi: There\u2019s an analogous situation going on now with Yemen. Yemen is the same. We\u2019re giving them intelligence on where to bomb. We\u2019re giving them weapons. But we don\u2019t know anything about what\u2019s going on. Must be a mistake of some kind! Taibbi: That\u2019s another part of the model that seems to have held up perfectly since 1988: the concept of worthy and unworthy victims. That\u2019s exactly it. Taibbi: Syria and Yemen are almost perfect analogues to the Cambodia and East Timor examples in your book. We used that term for East Timor and Cambodia. So the main themes ofManufacturing Consentare really there, apart from the institutional structure, you know. But that\u2019s a very dramatic example. Because here\u2019s two \u2013 you know, East Timor probably came as close to real genocide as anything in the post World War II period. Taibbi: And yet, you won\u2019t hear that word \u2018\u201cgenocide\u201d or see it anywhere in the popular press really attached to that incident \u2013 at least, not insofar as our involvement was concerned. There are other rather interesting cases. Take Kevin Buckley, theNewsweekbureau chief in Saigon. A very good journalist. After the My Lai Massacre, Buckley and an associate of his, Alex Shimkin, did a careful study of what was going on in the Quang Ngaiprovince, where the massacre took place. And what they discovered was what people in the peace movement already knew, that there was nothing special about My Lai. It was going on all over the place, and further more, these massacres were minor. The major massacres were via the saturation bombing. From guys sitting in air conditioned offices and telling B-52s to bomb everything in sight, you know. Those were the huge massacres. The My Lai, My Khe, the others like it, they were kind of footnotes.Newsweekwouldn\u2019t publish it, so he gave me the notes, and we basically published his notes, but nobody noticed that either."

I had material on that so, too, and a lot of other things, it covered a lot of ground. Now see Reagan was using \u2013 Congress barred direct military aid to Guatemala. So Reagan, what he did interestingly, was set up an international terror network. But we don\u2019t use people like Carlos the Jackal. We use terrorist states. Taibbi: Right. So we used Argentina, one of the neo-Nazi regimes. Taiwan. Israel was a big part of it. They provided the arms and the training and the support for the Guatemalan massacres. Incidentally, people are still fleeing today from the Mayan areas that were subjected to virtual genocide. But they are driven back to the border, of course. Taibbi: That brings me to another question. One of the main themes ofManufacturing Consentwas that it was hard for people to recognize propaganda as propaganda, because it was private and there was absence of direct state censorship. It\u2019s very much like the destruction of the press. It wasn\u2019t state censorship, so it\u2019s okay. Incidentally, there\u2019s an interesting book that just came out finally, says some of the obvious things about this, by a woman named Elizabeth Anderson. She\u2019s a philosopher and an economist. It\u2019s calledPrivate Governmentor some name like that, but her point is that, which is a major point, yes, there is a government, but governments can be repressive. But most of our lives are under private government, which she says are indistinguishable from communist dictatorships. Any business, for example. If you subject yourself to it, you become essentially a slave of the institution with no rights, give away your liberty, and so on. The interesting part of her book, which is somewhat new, is she goes through the seventeenth and eighteenth century advocacy of free markets by Adam Smith, Tom Paine, you know, up to Abraham Lincoln, and points out that that was a left wing position. Because they were advocating free markets, because they wanted to undermine state monopolies and mercantilism, and to allow people to become free, independent artisans not subject to any authority. And they regarded wage labor as equivalent to slavery. The only difference is that it\u2019s temporary. You can get out of it. And when the Industrial Revolution came along, everything changed. You could only survive by being subordinate to a major corporate structure, and wage labor became the norm. The contemporary libertarians are still citing the seventeenth and eighteenth century condemnations of wage labor and contract as being libertarian, because now it\u2019s not government. Everything has inverted totally. It\u2019s very much like you were saying before with censorship."

Taibbi: After you publishedManufacturing Consent, there was a major change in the business. I had seen this pretty dramatically because I\u2019d grown up in the media. But suddenly in the late eighties and early nineties, there was a new commercial strategy that Fox employed. It was less about getting the broadest possible audience, but more about capturing a demographic, continuing to feed them news that they agreed with.

Taibbi: And that has been massively accelerated by the Internet, by Facebook, and the platforms. The other aspect of that, which I think is maybe underestimated, is talk radio, it reaches a huge audience. And I\u2019ve often thought, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve got it around here, but in Boston, I used to listen to it all the time while I was driving. It\u2019s totally insane. Taibbi: It is. But how does that affect the model? BecauseManufacturing Consentwas significantly about organizingeverybodybehind hegemonic imperatives. But we now have a system where the news and its attendant messaging is fractured. Information is distributed differently, to each different silo. And many violently disagree with each other. Well, you know what\u2019s actually happened, I think is they disagree \u2013 but the divisiveness I think is somewhat misinterpreted. It\u2019s always described as some groups moving left, others moving right. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happened. I think both groups have moved to the right. There\u2019s a divide, but it\u2019s misrepresented. Take Bernie Sanders. Take a look at his policies. I mean, Eisenhower wouldn\u2019t have been surprised by them. No, literally! Eisenhower\u2019s position was that anybody who questioned the New Deal was out of his mind. There was strong support for unions by corporate leaders, in fact, because they kept things organized, and you didn\u2019t have strikes and so on. But, the Sanders proposals are pretty much \u2013 you know, they would have been considered maybe mildly liberal in the 1950s. But certainly not radical, not revolutionary. It\u2019s just the whole spectrum has moved so far to the right that theylookextreme."

    "output": "And I think it\u2019s the impact of the whole neoliberal aggression that was major. That began technically with Carter, really picked up with Reagan and Thatcher, across the world. You\u2019ve had tremendous damage to the general population under the neoliberal, business-first principles. And it\u2019s just happened everywhere. Take a look just at wages, I mean, real wages today are lower than in the late seventies. There\u2019s been economic growth, but into few pockets. Productivity keeps increasing, but not wages. Up until the mid-seventies, real wages tracked productivity. If you look back then, there\u2019s a split of productivity keeps going up, but wages stagnate or decline. And that\u2019s true by every measure you look at. Taibbi: And naturally, people are upset about that. They\u2019re upset. And the same in Europe, at least the anger, the hatred of institutions, the ugly attitudes emerge to try to blame somebody for what\u2019s going on. And you see in the European elections, in every election the centrist parties collapse, and they go to fringes. You see it in Brexit. Brexit is suicidal. But the people are so angry that they just want to get out of it. Taibbi: During the 2016 election, I remember very vividly the experience of covering Trump and being behind the rope line with all the reporters and Trump pointing us out and making us villains. He\u2019d basically say: \u201cThere are the elites, they\u2019re stenographers for the bad guys.\u201d And that was very effective I thought. Yes, and it\u2019s straight out of the fascist history. Go after the elites, even while you\u2019re being supported by the major elites. Taibbi: Right. You ever read Thomas Ferguson? He\u2019s a political economist, a very good one. His whole life he\u2019s been working on things like the impact of things like campaign funding on electability. And he did a very careful study of 2016 election. What turned out was that, in the end, in the last couple of months when it became it was looking very clearly as if Clinton was going to win, the corporate sector really got pretty upset. And they start pouring money into funding not only for Trump, but heavily into the Senate and the House, because they wanted to make sure the Republicans controlled the House and the Senate. And if you compare the increase in campaign funding with the shift in attitudes, it\u2019s almost perfect. It pushed not only Trump, but also the whole Congress into Republican wins. Just as a reflection of campaign funding. So the real elites knew where their bread was buttered. Taibbi: But Trump uses this trick of presenting other people as representatives of the elites. Standard technique of the fake populists against the elites, while you\u2019re actually working for them. Taibbi: Why do you think the population has become so much more conspiratorial-minded since the publication ofManufacturing Consent?Or has it? It seems to me that it has. Could it be that \u2013 well, when you wroteManufacturing Consent, there was a commonly accepted set of facts. We had three networks, they mostly reported the same things, now-"

    "output": "The crucial word wasdistributionsystems. The Internet doesn\u2019t dig up any information. So, the information\u2019s coming from the same place it will always do. It\u2019s the reporters on the ground. Unfortunately, there are fewer of them. But I think in a lot of ways, it\u2019s hard to measure, but my impression is that the media are probably more free and open than they were in the fifties and sixties. And the reason is that a lot of the younger people, the people who are now in the media, went through the sixties experience, which was very liberatory. It really opened people\u2019s minds, so they tend to be more critical and open-minded and so on. People forget how conformist the media were in the fifties and sixties. It was shocking. When you look back, it\u2019s mind-boggling. In 1961, I think around November, Kennedy authorized the U.S. Air Force to start bombing South Vietnam. They used South Vietnamese markings, but everybody knew what was going on. They were American planes. This is a big thing: starting to bomb the rural population in a foreign country. I think theNew York Timesmay have had ten lines on it on a back page. Nobody knew, nobody paid any attention. I don\u2019t think that could happen now. And there are many cases like this. Taibbi: Do you think that this is a source of concern to the government and large corporate interests, this idea that maybe there is a little bit too much freedom? A little too much independence? Maybe, something needs to be There\u2019s a very important book, which came out 1975. It\u2019s called theCrisis of Democracy. It\u2019s the first publication of the Trilateral Commission, which is a group of liberal internationalists from Europe, United States, and Japan, three main centers of capitalist democracy. What\u2019s the \u201cCrisis of Democracy\u201d? The \u201cCrisis of Democracy\u201d is that in the 1960s, all kinds of sectors of the population that are supposed to be passive and apathetic begin to try to enter the political arena to press for their own interests and concerns, and that imposes too much of a burden on the state, which becomes ungovernable. So, what we need is \u201cmore moderation in democracy.\u201d That\u2019s their phrase. People should go back into their corners and leave it to us. In fact, the American rapporteur Samuel Huntington looked back kind of nostalgically to the Truman years. He says Truman was able to govern the country politically with the aid of just a few Wall Street bankers. Thenwe had democracy. But he goes after the media. He says the media have become too adversarial, too independent. We may even have to institute government controls to try to contain them, because of what they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s theliberalposition. The Trilateral Commission also went after what they called the de-legitimation of the universities. They said that the institutions \u2013 and this is their phrase \u2013 these institutions responsible for the \u201cindoctrination of the young\u201d \u2013 are being de-legitimized. We\u2019ve got to have more indoctrination. Remember, that\u2019s the liberal end of the spectrum. Over to the right wing, you get much harsher things... but that\u2019s the intellectual background. We\u2019ve got to stop \u201ctoo much democracy,\u201d \u201ctoo much freedom.\u201d The 1960s were always called the \u201cTime of Troubles.\u201d That was a time when the country when all this started. Taibbi: You mention that in the book, that they talked about an \u201cexcess of democracy\u201d in terms of the media coverage of Vietnam. This is the main source of it. When the book came out, I immediately got the MIT library to buy about ten copies, because I figured they were going to put it out of print.(laughing).Which they did. They laterprinted it again. That\u2019s never discussed. I\u2019ve discussed it a lot. Taibbi: All of that rhetoric that you\u2019re talking about is now resurfacing. We\u2019re hearing again about \u201ctoo much democracy.\u201d And there are many discussions about having to rein in the media, really on both sides of the aisle politically. Yes. It\u2019s very much the same. Taibbi: Well, terrific. Professor, thank you so much. Thank you. Footnotes *Freedom House, as described inManufacturing Consent: \u201cFreedom House, which dates back to the early 1940s, has had interlocks with AIM, the World Anticommunist League, Resistance International, and U.S. government bodies such as Radio Free Europe and the CIA, and has long served as a virtual propaganda arm of the government and international right wing.\u201d **MORE, which went out of business in 1978. *** From Winthrop\u2019s sermon: \u201cFor we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill.

    "input": "Trump is taking all credit for the current state of the economy, which includes a historically low rate of unemployment. First, exactly what sort of economic policies has Trump implemented since coming to office that can explain the present economic boom, and, second, how really sound is the current state of the economy?",
    "output": "To begin with, there is reason for caution about the low rate of unemployment. In the (very good) economics journalChallenge, relying on Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, economist John Komlos estimates that \u201cthe real unemployment rate in the fall of 2018 was closer to 7.4 percent of the labor force. Among those without a high school diploma, it was twice as high,\u201d reaching 28 percent unemployed among African Americans. The prime reason for the discrepancy in figures \u2014 all from the same government sources \u2014 is the significant decline in labor force participation. Many have dropped out of the labor force in their prime years. The high actual unemployment rate, Komlos plausibly suggests, is part of the reason why \u201cthere is so much despair in the society.\u201d Gallup polls regularly measure stress, worry and anger. The U.S. ranks high by these measures, reaching new highs in 2018, by now even higher than during the great recession. In reported stress levels, the U.S. has \u201cone of the highest rates out of the 143 countries studied and it beat the global average (35 percent) by a full 20 percentage points.\u201d The U.S. is even above Venezuela in its current distress. The dire emotional state of Americans is illustrated dramatically by the \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d (death by suicide, drugs and alcohol) documented by Anne Case and Angus Deaton among working-class whites; tellingly, those \u201cwho would have entered the market starting in the early 1980s,\u201d when the neoliberal assault took off. The deaths of despair are estimated at 150,000 a year, contributing to the decline in life expectancy in the U.S. for the past two years, the first time since World War I and the 1918 flu pandemic \u2014 a phenomenon unprecedented in developed societies. All of this is happening in the most powerful state in world history, with extraordinary advantages not approached anywhere. Worth contemplating. \u201cThe alleged full employment,\u201d Komlos writes, \u201cis a statistical mirage designed to hide the real pain in the labor market,\u201d exacerbated by wage stagnation for 40 years and actual decline: \u201cReal median household incomes have been declining for every educational group since the turn of the twenty-first century,\u201d for those without a college degree by 17 percent, continuing the stagnation or decline in real hourly wages since the \u201880s. Add to this Alan Greenspan\u2019s \u201cgreater worker insecurity,\u201d the foundation of his success in economic management as he boasted to Congress, and we get a more realistic picture than what is in the headlines, and an explanation for the general despair. Much the same is true throughout the regions afflicted by the neoliberal/austerity plague, though deaths of despair seem to be an American phenomenon. The \u201ceconomic boom\u201d is a continuation of the slow recovery that began under Obama. The McConnell-Ryan Congress restricted a needed government stimulus during the Obama years, wailing about deficits, but as usual, when they took office it turned out that \u201cReagan taught us that deficits don\u2019t matter\u201d (Dick Cheney), when Republicans create them. Trump\u2019s one legislative achievement, the tax giveaway to the rich and corporate sector, provided a stimulus to the economy (without the promised investment). A Brookings Institution study by Robert Barro and Jason Furman (conservative, liberal) estimated that the boost of Trump\u2019s tax cut law to short-term GDP growth was 1.1 percent for the first quarter of 2019, accounting for the increase from the consensus expectation of 2 percent. The tax cut, of course, exploded the deficit, which can now provide a pretext for cutting social spending. The continuing increase in employment has led to a slight increase in wages, with opportunities for those at the lower end of the income scale, but it doesn\u2019t come close to making up what has been lost during the period of stagnation from the early \u201880s."

What is really behind Trump\u2019s trade wars with China and even with the EU, which the \u201ctariff man\u201d has called \u201ca brutal trading partner\u201d? Is it the vision of MAGA, or pure politics?",
    "output": "Both national economies will suffer, very likely the weaker party (China) more so. But as always, the framework of national conflict obscures a good deal. The estimated $6 trillion cost of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d re-declared by President Bush in 2001 (renewing Reagan\u2019s war on terror of 20 years earlier) is borne in varying ways among the population, and the same is true of the trade wars. One illustration has already been mentioned: higher taxes to keep Trump\u2019s constituency in line. It\u2019s of considerable interest to explore the justification for the trade war, to inquire into just how \u201cna\u00efve America has been bullied by China.\u201d I\u2019ve already discussed China\u2019s responsibility for job loss. Other complaints have to do with their unfair economic practices, such as targeting funds to specific industries \u2014 something we\u2019d never dream of doing, and would not have stooped to in earlier years. That aside, why is this a complaint, rather than a cry of joy? Ultranationalist True Believers should be celebrating China\u2019s stupidity, which, according to received free market doctrine should be harming their economy, hence contributing to U.S. economic power. As an aside, it should be noted that U.S. economic power is in fact astonishing. In recent articles and an important forthcoming book titledAmerican Power Globalized: Rethinking National Power in the Age of Globalization, international economist Sean Kenji Starrs argues persuasively that in the recent years of globalization, national accounts mean much less than they used to. A more realistic estimate of economic power is the share of global wealth owned by nationally based multinational corporations. For the U.S., that comes to the staggering figure of about half of world wealth, more than U.S. national economic power at its height after World War II. How this will be affected by Trump\u2019s wrecking ball, with its possibly complex effects on global supply chains, remains to be seen. Again, this colossal wealth, of course, does not devolve to the population. Another charge is that China steals U.S. technology by forcing firms to hand over secrets as a condition on investment (already dealt with) and by violating World Trade Organization rules on intellectual property (TRIPS). Again, other questions arise, discussed particularly by economist Dean Baker for many years. Putting aside the legitimacy of these highly protectionist devices, which raise patent protection far beyond the historical norm, we can ask who gains and who loses if, say, China uses discoveries in U.S. research labs to produce cheaper drugs than the corporations that have gained the patents, or to develop a better alternative to the Windows operating system? American consumers gain, while Big Pharma\u2019s huge profits are somewhat reduced and Bill Gates might decline slightly in the ranks of richest men in the world."

That the Chinese state is harsh, brutal and oppressive is not in doubt. China\u2019s \u201cre-education camps\u201d for perhaps a million Uyghurs, which may well be the largest mass incarceration of a racial or religious group since the Holocaust, is surely a major crime, meriting harsh condemnation.

My personal view is that such a course of action will only serve to increase Trump\u2019s popularity among his base, and maybe even beyond. I agree. Charges of impeachment go to the Senate for trial. Trump\u2019s lock on the Republican majority should be enough to clear him of any charges. The effect will then be much like that of the Mueller investigation. He will claim to have been proven innocent of the charges, which he will depict as a malicious and underhanded effort by the Democrats and the Deep State to silence the Tribune of the People, behavior that may even be treasonous, as he is now intimating with regard to the Mueller investigation. His base will be energized, if not infuriated, by what these \u201ctraitors\u201d are trying to do to their defender.

Yet, Donald Trump did not hesitate in the midst of the George Floyd protests to declare that, \u201cAmerica is the greatest country in the world,\u201d while he is seeking at one and the same time to start a new civil war in this country through tactics of extreme polarization. Can you comment on the above observations?",
    "output": "I don\u2019t think Trump wants a civil war. Rather, as he says, he wants to \u201cdominate\u201d by violence and terrify any potential opposition. That is his standard reflex. Just look at his outburst when one Republican Senator, Lisa Murkowski, broke strict Party discipline and raised some mild doubts about the magnificence of His Royal Majesty. Or his firing of the scientist in charge of vaccine development when he raised a question about one of Trump\u2019s quack medicines. Or his purge of the inspector generals who might investigate the fetid swamp he\u2019s constructed in Washington. It\u2019s routine. He\u2019s a radically new phenomenon in American political history. Another Trump reflex is his call for \u201cthe most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen\u201d when peaceful protesters appear near his abode. The phrase \u201cvicious dogs\u201d evokes the country\u2019s horror when images of vicious dogs attacking Black demonstrators appeared on the front pages during the civil rights movement. Trump\u2019s use of the phrase was either by intent, to stir up racist violence, or reflexive, arising from his innermost sentiments. I leave it to others to judge which is worse, and what either tells us about the malignancy at the center of global power. With that qualification, there is no inconsistency. Both the claim that America is the greatest country in the world, in his special sense, and his call for domination, follow from his guiding doctrine: ME! direct corollary to the doctrine is that he must satisfy the demands of extreme wealth and corporate power, which tolerate his antics only insofar as he serves their interests abjectly, as he does with admirable consistency in his legislative programs and executive decisions, such as the recent Environmental Protection Agency decision to increase air pollution \u201cin the midst of an unprecedented respiratory pandemic,\u201d risking tens of thousands of deaths, disproportionately Black, the business press reports, but increasing wealth for those who matter. The success of his tactics was revealed clearly at the January extravaganza at the Davos ski resort, where the masters of the universe, as they are called, meet annually to cavort and congratulate one another. This year\u2019s meeting departed from the norm. There was visible concern about \u201creputational risk\u201d \u2014 recognition that the peasants are coming with their pitchforks. Therefore, there were solemn declarations that,We realize we\u2019ve made mistakes, but we are changing, you can put your faith in us, we will become \u201csoulful corporations,\u201dto borrow the phrase used in accolades to corporate America in the \u201850s. The keynote address was, of course, handed to Trump, the Godfather. The elegant figures assembled don\u2019t like him. His vulgarity and general brutishness disrupt their preferred image of enlightened humanism. But they gave him rousing applause. Antics aside, he made clear that he understands the bottom line: which pockets have to be stuffed lavishly with more dollars. Another direct corollary of the guiding doctrine is that the con man in charge must control his voting base while he is stabbing most of them in the back with his actual programs \u2014 a difficult feat, which he has so far carried off with much skill. The voting base includes not only avid white supremacists but others in the grip of the fear of \u201cthem\u201d that is a core part of the culture \u2014 and is of course not without foundation. One consequence of bitter repression is that \u201cthey\u201d often resort to crime \u2014 that is, the retail crime of the weak, not the wholesale crime of the powerful. For Trump\u2019s prime constituency of great wealth and corporate power, America is indeed the greatest country in the world. How can one fault a country in which 0.1 percent of the population hold 20 percent of the wealth while the majority try to survive from paycheck to paycheck and CEO compensation has reached 287 times that of workers? And calls for domination by vicious dogs placates much of the voting base. So, all falls into place."

    "output": "The answer is given by what happened in those 400 years. It\u2019s been reviewed before, but for me at least it\u2019s useful to take a few minutes to think it through again until it becomes deeply ingrained in consciousness. In summary: The first 250 years created the most vicious system of slavery in human history once the colonies had gained their liberty, the foundation of much of the nation\u2019s wealth. It was unique not only in hideous cruelty but also in that it was based on skin color. That is ineradicable, a curse reaching to future generations. Other minorities were brutally treated, even barred from the country by racist laws (Jews and Italians, the prime target of the 1924 immigration law, which lasted for 40 years, long enough to condemn European Jews to crematoria, and post-war, to ensure that survivors went to Palestine, whatever they might have preferred). But the stigma was not permanent. They could be assimilated and turn to more \u201cacceptable\u201d professions than running Murder, Inc. Also unique is the fervor of American racism. The \u201cone drop of blood\u201d criterion for the U.S. anti-miscegenation laws that remained on the books until the civil rights movement of the 1960s was so severe that the Nazis rejected it when they were searching for a model for the racist Nuremberg laws \u2014 though they did appeal to the American precedent as the only one they could find. Formal slavery ended in 1865, and a decade of reconstruction offered Black people a taste of freedom, which they used with remarkable effectiveness, given the horrifying legacy. That soon ended. A North-South compact offered southern racists free rein to murder and repress, and to provide a fine workforce for agribusiness and the southern industrial revolution by criminalizing Black life and offering employers a disciplined work force with zero rights. One of the best general books on the post-reconstruction period is calledSlavery by Another Name, byWall Street JournalAtlanta Bureau Chief Douglas Blackmon. That stain on American history lasted pretty much until WWII, when free labor was needed for war industry. I remember well when Black domestic servants disappeared from middle-class homes. During the great growth period after the war, some opportunities opened for Black Americans, though serious impediments remained. The educational opportunities offered by the GI Bill, a major contribution to the health of the society, were denied to Black people. Home ownership, the basis for wealth for most people, was restricted by federal laws barring Black people from federally funded housing \u2014 laws that were hated by the liberals who voted for them, but there was no recourse if there was to be any housing at all, thanks to the iron grip of influential southern Democrats, whose racist passions shifted to the Republicans under Nixon\u2019s southern strategy. By the time these racist laws were withdrawn under pressure of the activism of the \u201860s, the opportunities for many Black Americans were lost. The economy suffered stagflation in the \u201870s and then the hammer blow of neoliberalism, designed to keep the poor and working people in their place, with Black communities as usual the most brutally affected. That assault was compounded by a new wave of criminalization of Black life initiated by the deeply racist Reagan administration. That was amplified by Clinton under the cloak of \u201cI am one of you,\u201d and on to George Floyd. It\u2019s not hard then to answer the question, at least on one level. At a deeper level, we can ask why the disease is so hard to cure. It is worth bearing in mind that racism is not unique to the U.S. It has always existed in one form or another, but it was not until the Age of Enlightenment and the imperial conquests that it assumed its contemporary virulence. To see it on display in Europe, it is enough to view the intensive efforts of \u201ccivilized\u201d Europeans to keep the victims of centuries of hideous European slaughter and terror from \u201csoiling\u201d their shores. Better that tens of thousands should die in the Mediterranean, fleeing from Libya, the scene of the first post-World War I genocide at the hands of the Italian fascist regime \u2014 which, we might recall, was highly praised in the liberal democracies of the West, including the guru of \u201clibertarianism,\u201d Ludwig von Mises, who wrote in 1927 that, \u201cIt cannot be denied that Fascism and similar movements aimed at the establishment of dictatorships are full of the best intentions and that their intervention has for the moment saved European civilization. The merit that Fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history.\u201d (His apologists plead that he only intended for these \u201cbest intentions\u201d to be a temporary means to \u201csave civilization\u201d; the Blackshirts could then retire.) Aside from Trump\u2019s criminal negligence of the spread of COVID-19 and his complete insensitivity to the frustration and anger of the people seeking justice through their street protests against the killing of George Floyd and police brutality generally, the United States does not seem to be well served by its version of federalism. Federalism in its modern form dates back to the Civil War, which changed the phrase \u201cUnited States\u201d from plural to singular (in English at least). But the problems with U.S. federalism trace back to the country\u2019s founding, and are becoming very severe. In the late 18th century, the U.S. Constitution was a progressive doctrine in comparative terms, even though it was a \u201cframers\u2019 coup\u201d against popular pressures for democracy, to borrow the title of the fine study by Michael Klarman that is the gold standard for scholarship on the establishment of the Constitution. Even the words \u201cWe the people,\u201d however remote from reality, were a serious challenge to the regimes of the day. The challenge was serious enough to evoke the venerable domino theory among the leaders of the day. King George III feared that the example of the American revolution might lead to erosion of the empire. The Tsar and Metternich had similar concerns about \u201cthe pernicious doctrines of republicanism and popular self-rule\u201d spread by \u201cthe apostles of sedition\u201d in the colonies that had cast off the British yoke. That was then. By today\u2019s standards, the U.S. political system is so regressive that if the U.S. were to apply for membership in the European Union, it would probably be turned down by the European Court of Justice. The Senate is a travesty of democracy. Wyoming, with 500,000 people, has the same number of senators as California, with 40 million. This extreme perversion of democracy affects the Electoral College as well. The House was carefully designed by Madison with measures to reduce the threat of democracy, but all of that has been effaced by radical gerrymandering and an array of devices, mainly devised by contemporary Republicans, to suppress voting by the wrong people. The powers of the presidency have been constrained by good faith and trust, the way the British Constitution functioned for centuries (now eroding). With a wrecker like Trump in office, backed by a party of trembling cowards, these powers verge on dictatorship, as we are now seeing. By now a small minority \u2014 rural, white, devoutly Christian or evangelical \u2014 can run Congress. Furthermore, this is ineradicable. The small states can block a constitutional amendment. These remarks keep to the formalities of the democratic system, putting aside those whom Adam Smith called \u201cthe masters of mankind,\u201d FDR\u2019s \u201ceconomic royalists.\u201d Smith recognized them to be the \u201cprincipal architects of policy\u201d in 18th century England, the model of democracy in his day. As he wrote, they made sure that policy served their interests, however \u201cgrievous\u201d their impact on the general population. Today, they virtually own the political system, from campaign funding to the overwhelming force of lobbyists and innumerable other devices to keep the government securely in their pocket. Though their power is immense, it is fragile. Hence the concern at Davos about \u201creputational risks,\u201d and the statements of top executives that they are mending their ways. They don\u2019t have to read David Hume to learn that since \u201cFORCE is always on the side of the governed, the governors have nothing to support them but opinion,\u201d which can be withdrawn. The power of the masters is indeed fragile. It can be restricted, even overturned, by a public dedicated to different goals. But that requires organization. Thatcher and Reagan knew what they were doing when they launched the neoliberal era with a sharp attack on labor unions, traditionally the spearhead of struggles for social justice. Just keeping to the formal democratic system, a serious constitutional crisis is inevitable for structural reasons \u2014 and Trump is edging toward it right now. It is a matter of concern in high places committed to the constitutional order. There is no precedent for the denunciation of his call for violent suppression of protest by some of the highest military officers \u2014 the two previous chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, his former defense secretary and former chief of staff, the former commander of NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, all top-ranking generals \u2014 some of whom went on to eloquent support for the protesters. More important, also without precedent is the remarkable mobilization of whites all over the country to participate in the mass nonviolent protests, braving the serious threat of succumbing to the virus along with some police violence. A poll in the first days of June found 64 percent of American adults were \u201csympathetic to people who are out protesting right now,\u201d while 27 percent said they were not and 9 percent were unsure. Where this will lead is anyone\u2019s guess, and more may be coming as a fateful election approaches. It\u2019s hard to determine what is more ominous: another four years for the malignancy to spread its poison, or an electoral loss that Trump will declare illegitimate, refusing to leave the White House, calling on the heavily armed \u201ctough guys\u201d he regularly urges on to defend their \u201cSecond Amendment rights\u201d by protecting the self-declared \u201cchosen one,\u201d eyes lifted to heaven. Is this a wild fantasy? Maybe, maybe not. It\u2019s being discussed in respectable circles. Specialists on the topic have warned that Trump is bringing fascism to the U.S. Personally, I think that gives him too much credit. Fascism is too sophisticated a doctrine for him to grasp. It is, furthermore, a doctrine that is antithetical to his own simplistic conception of how the world should be run: by the masters of the universe, with Trump wielding the wrecking ball at whim. Fascist ideology calls for strict control of the society by the fascist party led by the maximal leader; crucially, control of the compliant business classes. That is almost the opposite of what prevails and what Trump\u2019s limited vision seeks to entrench further. He may advocate fascist tactics, but that\u2019s far from fascism. It resembles more closely a tin-pot dictatorship. Well-regarded analysts in the mainstream are concerned. One is former CIA analyst Robert Baer, who has had lots of experience in tin-pot dictatorships. In his view, If I were a foreign intelligence officer assigned to Washington, I\u2019d ask how close he is to imposing martial law because it looks pretty close to me. I mean, he said he will. He\u2019s preparing for it. He\u2019s got a secretary of defense right now who\u2019s balking. It\u2019s very easy to remove him and put somebody in his place. This president is very insecure. And we\u2019ve watched him go after the FBI and the Department of Justice, and he will go after the Pentagon until he gets the officers in that don\u2019t countermand his orders.... I have never seen this in the United States, never heard since the Civil War.... If I were a foreigner, I would really wonder ... what\u2019s happening to American democracy. We can remind ourselves of how fateful the coming election is by keeping our eyes on current science \u2014 for example, the recent report from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, the main monitor of atmospheric CO2, that levels have not only long surpassed all of human history, but are approaching the highest they have been for 3 million years, when sea levels were 50 to 80 feet higher than they are today. The coronavirus dip is a statistically insignificant deviation, though it does serve to instruct us that there is still time to avert a cataclysm, though not much. The countries of the world are seeking to do something to respond, not enough, but at least something. The country that is doing the least is the United States, in the hands of the wrecker-in-chief. Trump does not waste a minute in his relentless drive to race toward the cliff. His February 2020 budget proposal, while naturally calling for continued defunding of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the midst of a raging pandemic, also called for further subsidies to the fossil fuel industries that are laboring to destroy organized human life. To accelerate the disaster, Trump is using the cover of the pandemic to dismantle \u201cfederal regulations designed to protect workers, consumers, investors and the environment,\u201d rescind requirements for factories and power plants to monitor or report missions, waive environmental laws for pipelines and other projects, and instruct \u201cagencies across the government to rescind, modify or simply stop enforcing regulations if they burden the economy.\u201d The last phrase is a euphemism for interfering with profits. Helping the economy would mean building infrastructure and productive capacity, not pouring funds into keeping stock prices high for the benefit of rich investors and predatory financial capital. \u201cThe White House will seek to make many of those roughly 600 deregulatory actions permanent,\u201d according to a former White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity. Trump\u2019s May 19 proclamation, on which this press account is based, drops enough hints to render the prediction plausible. The heads of all agencies are instructed to \u201creview any regulatory standards they have temporarily rescinded, suspended, modified, or waived\u201d and other actions they have taken, and \u201cdetermine which, if any, would promote economic recoveryif made permanent,\u201d subject to conditions that are meaningless; and to consider an array of actions that \u201ctemporarilyor permanently\u201d relate to \u201cregulatory standards that may inhibit economic recovery\u201d (emphasis added). The phrase \u201ceconomic recovery\u201d has always had a definite meaning in the Trumpian lexicon that there is no need to review. Trump\u2019s dedication to destroy organized human life in the near future for the sake of short-term profit for his constituency is by far the worst of his crimes, in fact the most extreme crime in human history. It is approached in malignancy only by his systematic dismantling of the arms control regime that has reduced the severe threat of terminal nuclear war; and, concomitantly, his promoting the development of more advanced weapons that enemies can use to destroy us. Amazingly, none of this enters into current discussion, except at the margins."

Is this an indication that neoliberalism is finally on its way out? Or will we see a return to the \u201cnormal state of affairs\u201d once the health crisis is over, especially in the United States, where there is significant resistance to the ideas of social democracy?",
    "output": "Like a lot of good questions, this one is virtually impossible to answer. The forces that created the current socioeconomic regime, including the pandemic and the race to self-destruction, are not wasting a moment in their dedication to ensure that the neoliberal disaster persists, indeed in harsher form, with more sophisticated means of surveillance and control. They will succeed unless the general population withdraws consent, makes use of the power that is in the hands of the governed, and becomes organized to create a world that is more humane and just \u2014 in fact, survivable. That requires at the very least constructing a minimal social state. We can see what a difficult step that will be by looking at the liberal commentary on the Sanders campaign: good ideas, but the American people aren\u2019t ready for it. That is an incredible indictment of American society, which, according to this judgment, is not able to rise to what is normal elsewhere: universal health care and free higher education, Sanders\u2019s major planks. But joining the world should be the least of the objectives for a progressive popular movement. Why should decisions about our lives be transferred from elected representatives, over which people have at least some control, to unaccountable private hands, as neoliberal doctrine dictates? Going further, why should people spend almost all of their waking lives under controls so extreme that Stalin couldn\u2019t have dreamed of them \u2014 what is called \u201chaving a job\u201d? Work under external command is an attack on fundamental human rights and dignity that had been regarded with contempt from classical Greece and Rome until the 19th century, and was bitterly condemned by working people in the early industrial revolution. That\u2019s only a bare beginning. A different world is possible, a very different one. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length."

Polychroniou: Tensions continue to escalate between Russia and Ukraine, and there is little room for optimism since the U.S. offer for de-escalation fails to meet any of Russia\u2019s security demands. As such, wouldn\u2019t it be more accurate to say that the Russia-Ukraine border crisis stems in reality from the U.S.\u2019s intransigent position over Ukrainian membership in NATO? In the same context, is it hard to imagine what might have been Washington\u2019s response to the hypothetical event that Mexico wanted to join a Moscow-driven military alliance?",
    "output": "We hardly need to linger on the latter question. No country would dare to make such a move in what former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s Secretary of War Henry Stimson called \u201cOur little region over here,\u201d when he was condemning all spheres of influence (except for our own \u2014 which in reality, is hardly limited to the Western hemisphere). Secretary of State Antony Blinken is no less adamant today in condemning Russia\u2019s claim to a \u201csphere of influence,\u201d a concept we firmly reject (with the same reservation). There was of course one famous case when a country in our little region came close to a military alliance with Russia, the 1962 missile crisis. The circumstances, however, were quite unlike Ukraine. President John F. Kennedy was escalating his terrorist war against Cuba to a threat of invasion; Ukraine, in sharp contrast, faces threats as a result of its potentially joining a hostile military alliance. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s reckless decision to provide Cuba with missiles was also an effort to slightly rectify the enormous U.S. preponderance of military force after JFK had responded to Khrushchev\u2019s offer of mutual reduction of offensive weapons with the largest military buildup in peacetime history, though the U.S. was already far ahead. We know what that led to. The tensions over Ukraine are extremely severe, with Russia\u2019s concentration of military forces at Ukraine\u2019s borders. The Russian position has been quite explicit for some time. It was stated clearly by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at his press conference at the United Nations: \u201cThe main issue is our clear position on the inadmissibility of further expansion of NATO to the East and the deployment of strike weapons that could threaten the territory of the Russian Federation.\u201d Much the same was reiterated shortly after by Putin, as he had often said before. There is a simple way to deal with deployment of weapons: Don\u2019t deploy them. There is no justification for doing so. The U.S. may claim that they are defensive, but Russia surely doesn\u2019t see it that way, and with reason. The question of further expansion is more complex. The issue goes back over 30 years, to when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was collapsing. There were extensive negotiations among Russia, the U.S. and Germany. (The core issue was German unification.) Two visions were presented. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev proposed a Eurasian security system from Lisbon to Vladivostok with no military blocs. The U.S. rejected it: NATO stays, Russia\u2019s Warsaw Pact disappears. For obvious reasons, German reunification within a hostile military alliance is no small matter for Russia. Nevertheless, Gorbachev agreed to it, with a quid pro quo: No expansion to the East. President George H.W. Bush and Secretary of State James Baker agreed. In their words to Gorbachev: \u201cNot only for the Soviet Union but for other European countries as well, it is important to have guarantees that if the United States keeps its presence in Germany within the framework of NATO, not an inch of NATO\u2019s present military jurisdiction will spread in an eastern direction.\u201d \u201cEast\u201d meant East Germany. No one had a thought about anything beyond, at least in public. That\u2019s agreed on all sides. German leaders were even more explicit about it. They were overjoyed just to have Russian agreement to unification, and the last thing they wanted was new problems. There is extensive scholarship on the matter \u2014 Mary Sarotte, Joshua Shifrinson, and others, debating exactly who said what, what they meant, what\u2019s its status, and so on. It is interesting and illuminating work, but what it comes down to, when the dust settles, is what I quoted from the declassified record. President H.W. Bush pretty much lived up to these commitments. So did President Bill Clinton at first, until 1999, the 50th anniversary of NATO; with an eye on the Polish vote in the upcoming election, some have speculated. He admitted Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to NATO. President George W. Bush \u2014 the lovable goofy grandpa who was celebrated in the press on the 20th anniversary of his invasion of Afghanistan \u2014 let down all the bars. He brought in the Baltic states and others. In 2008, he invited Ukraine to join NATO, poking the bear in the eye. Ukraine is Russia\u2019s geostrategic heartland, apart from intimate historic relations and a large Russia-oriented population. Germany and France vetoed Bush\u2019s reckless invitation, but it\u2019s still on the table. No Russian leader would accept that, surely not Gorbachev, as he made clear. As in the case of deployment of offensive weapons on the Russian border, there is a straightforward answer. Ukraine can have the same status as Austria and two Nordic countries throughout the whole Cold War: neutral, but tightly linked to the West and quite secure, part of the European Union to the extent they chose to be. The U.S. adamantly rejects this outcome, loftily proclaiming its passionate dedication to the sovereignty of nations, which cannot be infringed: Ukraine\u2019s right to join NATO must be honored. This principled stand may be lauded in the U.S., but it surely is eliciting loud guffaws in much of the world, including the Kremlin. The world is hardly unaware of our inspiring dedication to sovereignty, notably in the three cases that particularly enraged Russia: Iraq, Libya and Kosovo-Serbia. Iraq need not be discussed: U.S. aggression enraged almost everyone. The NATO assaults on Libya and Serbia, both a slap in Russia\u2019s face during its sharp decline in the \u201890s, is clothed in righteous humanitarian terms in U.S. propaganda. It all quickly dissolves under scrutiny, as amply documented elsewhere. And the richer record of U.S. reverence for the sovereignty of nations needs no review. It is sometimes claimed that NATO membership increases security for Poland and others. A much stronger case can be made that NATO membership threatens their security by heightening tensions. Historian Richard Sakwa, a specialist on East Europe, observed that \u201cNATO\u2019s existence became justified by the need to manage threats provoked by its enlargement\u201d \u2014 a plausible judgment. There is much more to say about Ukraine and how to deal with the very dangerous and mounting crisis there, but perhaps this is enough to suggest that there is no need to inflame the situation and to move on to what might well turn out to be a catastrophic war. There is, in fact, a surreal quality to the U.S. rejection of Austrian-style neutrality for Ukraine. U.S. policy makers know perfectly well that admission of Ukraine to NATO is not an option for the foreseeable future. We can, of course, put aside the ridiculous posturing about the sanctity of sovereignty. So, for the sake of a principle in which they do not believe for a moment, and in pursuit of an objective that they know is out of reach, the U.S. is risking what may turn into a shocking catastrophe. On the surface, it seems incomprehensible, but there are plausible imperial calculations."

So why is the U.S. so keen on NATO expansion eastward to the point of treating a Russian invasion of Ukraine as imminent, even when Ukrainian leaders themselves don\u2019t seem to think so? And since when did Ukraine come to represent a beacon of democracy?",
    "output": "It is indeed curious to watch what is unfolding. The U.S. is vigorously fanning the flames while Ukraine is asking it to tone down the rhetoric. While there is much turmoil about why the demon Putin is acting as he is, U.S. motives are rarely subject to scrutiny. The reason is familiar: By definition, U.S. motives are noble, even if its efforts to implement them are perhaps misguided. Nevertheless, the question might merit some thought, at least by \u201cthe wild men in the wings,\u201d to borrow former National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy\u2019s phrase, referring to those incorrigible figures who dare to subject Washington to the standards applied elsewhere. possible answer is suggested by a famous slogan about the purpose of NATO: to keep Russia out, to keep Germany down and to keep the U.S. in. Russia is out, far out. Germany is down. What remains is the question whether the U.S. will be in Europe \u2014 more accurately, should be in charge. Not all have quietly accepted this principle of world affairs, among them: Charles de Gaulle, who advanced his concept of Europe from the Atlantic to the Ural\u2019s; former German Chancellor Willy Brandt\u2019s Ostpolitik; and French President Emmanuel Macron, with his current diplomatic initiatives that are causing much displeasure in Washington. If the Ukraine crisis is resolved peacefully, it will be a European affair, breaking from the post-World War II \u201cAtlanticist\u201d conception that places the U.S. firmly in the driver\u2019s seat. It might even be a precedent for further moves toward European independence, maybe even moving toward Gorbachev\u2019s vision. With China\u2019s Belt-and-Road initiative encroaching from the East, much larger issues of global order arise."

More apt is the description of the organization as \u201ca radical insurgency \u2014 ideologically extreme, scornful of facts and compromise, and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.\u201d This characterization by political analysts Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise is from a decade ago, pre-Donald Trump. By now it\u2019s far out of date. In the acronym \u201cGOP,\u201d what remains is \u201cO.\u201d I don\u2019t know whether the popular base that Trump has whipped up into a worshipful cult is questioning the aggressive stance of Republican leaders, or if they even care. Evidence is skimpy. Leading right-wing figures closely associated with the GOP are moving well to the right of European opinion, and of the stance of those who hope to retain some semblance of democracy in the U.S. They are going even beyond Trump in their enthusiastic support for Hungarian President Viktor Orban\u2019s \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d extolling it for saving Western civilization, no less. This effusive welcome for Orban\u2019s dismantling of democracy might bring to mind the praise for Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini for having \u201csaved European civilization [so that] the merit that Fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history\u201d; the thoughts of the revered founder of the neoliberal movement that has reigned for the past 40 years, Ludwig von Mises, in his 1927 classicLiberalism. Fox Newscommentator Tucker Carlson has been the most outspoken of the enthusiasts. Many Republican senators either go along with him or claim ignorance of what Orban is doing, a remarkable confession of illiteracy at the peak of global power. The highly regarded senior Sen. Charles Grassley reports that he knows about Hungary only from Carlson\u2019s TV expositions, and approves. Such performances tell us a good deal about the radical insurgency. On Ukraine, breaking with the GOP leadership, Carlson asks why we should take any position on a quarrel between \u201cforeign countries that don\u2019t care anything about the United States.\u201d Whatever one\u2019s views on international affairs, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve left the domain of rational discourse far behind, and are moving into territory with an unattractive history, to put it mildly."

When you think about what happened to George Floyd within the larger historical context of white racism within the U.S., how does Floyd\u2019s death speak to you?For me, it was not anomalous, but how did it speak to you?",
    "output": "His death dramatically symbolized 400 years of hideous crimes and atrocities, and evidently it meant that to a large part of the population. It is quite striking what happened after his assassination, as we should call it. There was a huge outpouring, nothing comparable in American history. There were huge demonstrations; there was a sense of dedicated solidarity of Black and white people marching together. They were nonviolent overwhelmingly, though the right wing would like you to believe otherwise. There was also enormous public support, with two-thirds of the population supportive of protest. There is nothing remotely like that in U.S. history. Protests led by Martin Luther King Jr., at the very peak of his popularity, didn\u2019t come anywhere close to that. That\u2019s the result, I think, of a lot of work that\u2019s been done on the ground by Black Lives Matter and other groups which have raised the level of consciousness and awareness to the point where when this thing happened it just lit a spark, and the kindling was ready to burn. And it\u2019s had a longtime impact. I think it\u2019s changed perception and understanding considerably, and not undermined by the fact that police-perpetrated killings continue almost daily."

    "input": "As I was watching the guilty verdict of Derek Chauvin, I\u2019m sure that Floyd\u2019s family had experienced some sense of relief and perhaps they could breathe again as well. Yet, it also occurred to me that in the case of finding Chauvin guilty on all three charges, there was such a low threshold to demonstrate his guilt. He had knelt on him for nine minutes and 29 seconds. I don\u2019t want to come across as pessimistic or cynical, but what do you see as \u201ctriumphant\u201d or \u201cprogressive\u201d regarding the guilty verdict?",
    "output": "You know, there had been an atmosphere in the past, as you know, better than I do, in which Black lives just didn\u2019t matter. The sentiment was that if a white person was brought to trial after killing a Black person, the reasoning was that they probably had a \u201cgood reason.\u201d So, just free them. Of course, there were even worse cases where whites carried out murders and lynchings and were praised. Well, fortunately, we\u2019re past that. But not so far in the past, Black Panther leader Fred Hampton, for example, was assassinated in a Gestapo-style murder, set-up by the FBI, who fed to the Chicago police fake stories about guns being stashed in his apartment. The police raided his apartment at about 4 o\u2019clock in the morning and murdered him and his friend, Mark Clark. Just murdered them. The reason for killing Hampton was very simple. He was the most important of the Black Panther organizers. The FBI wanted to go after the successful organizers and Hampton was the peak of them; he had to be killed. In fact, it was the last of a long series of efforts where the FBI tried to instigate a feud between the Black Panthers and the criminal group, Blackstone Rangers, which were in Chicago. The FBI sent fake letters to the Rangers written in fake Black dialect saying that the Panthers had a contract out on their leaders. But they were closely enough integrated, so they knew what was going on. In the case of Hampton, however, they had an FBI infiltrator, who was his bodyguard. The point is that there was a long FBI plot not just against the Panthers, but against the Black movements altogether. It took years of dedicated work by some great young lawyers, Flint Taylor and Jeffrey Haas, working on the case for years to finally get a kind of civil settlement. This one case vastly outweighs anything that was charged against Richard Nixon. Was he charged for his use of national political police carrying out murder and assassination campaigns against Black organizers? And regarding your question, that\u2019s a big difference between then and now. Now at least circumstances are such that a jury can convict someone for the perfectly obvious murder of a Black man. But if you turn onFox News, notice the reaction. Listen to Tucker Carlson, who claims that the trial of Derek Chauvin wasn\u2019t legitimate because the jury was intimidated, they were terrified that Black people were going to come and destroy their houses and kill them all. Alan Dershowitz, the so-called civil libertarian who likes to present himself as that, also claimed that the trial was illegitimate because the jury was intimidated. We haven\u2019t freed ourselves. There\u2019s a lot of distance to go, but the killing of George Floyd did bring out something very positive in the society, namely the beginnings of understanding that there\u2019s something really hideous at the core of our history. It has come up in other ways, like the 1619 Project published byThe New York Times. Some historians are carping about it, \u201cYou got this wrong; you\u2019ve got that wrong.\u201d But it\u2019s not even relevant when, finally, we have a recognition in the main media and the country that we\u2019ve had 400 years of hideous atrocities experienced by Black people. So, let\u2019s take a look at it, ask who we are and what we are. This is not something irrelevant to American history. It\u2019s the basis of U.S. economic prosperity; that\u2019s why I\u2019m privileged. Cotton was the oil of the 19th century. The large part of the wealth of the United States, and also Britain, and to a lesser extent the continent, was based on cheap cotton. How do you get cheap cotton? Well, by the most hideous, atrocious system of slavery that ever existed. A lot of this is just coming to light. Edward E. Baptist\u2019s book,The Half Has Never Been Told, provides an astonishing picture of things that maybe professional historians knew something about, but certainly the general public, even the informed public, wasn\u2019t informed about. I didn\u2019t know a lot of the things he described; they were way beyond the horrors that I knew about. A lot of this is just beginning to come out after hundreds of years. It\u2019s about time. Most certainly. And we have to look at a lot of other things. For example, why do so few Black people have access to wealth? There are many reasons. One reason is the New Deal measures, which determined that federal housing had to be segregated. And in the 1950s, for the first time, a Black man had a chance to get a decent job in an auto union job at an auto plant, to make some money and perhaps buy a house. But he couldn\u2019t buy a house, because the Federal Housing Projects (Levittown, in Long Island, New York, for example) kept Black people out. In the U.S., wealth and housing are very closely related. A lot of people\u2019s wealth is in their house. Once Black workers finally got just a little bit of emancipation, a chance to get a job, they were told, \u201cSorry folks, but you can\u2019t buy a house here because we have racist laws.\u201d This ran into the later 1960s, which was finally overturned by the popular activism in the 1960s. I should say that the liberal Democratic senators who voted for this law were strongly opposed to segregation. They were not racists. They wanted nonsegregated housing, but they couldn\u2019t get anything through the Southern Democrats, who dominated the Senate. This is very similar in our own time when you can\u2019t get anything through unless you somehow get the Republican Party, which is dedicated to wealth and power, to agree. And this is a big problem in this country."

    "input": "In the past few months, we have heard about shooting after shooting. Could you talk about the escalating danger of gun violence? My sense is that there are profound cultural myths regarding gun ownership. Could you speak to this as well?",
    "output": "Gun violence is increasing not just here, but one of the worst effects of the U.S. gun culture is in Mexico and Latin America. They\u2019re flooded with American guns, which are killing people at a hideous rate. Mexico is a killing field with largely American guns. In Central America, there is the same thing. You flood areas with guns where there are plenty of tensions and crises and you\u2019re going to get killings. Instead of people shouting at each other, they\u2019ll shoot each other. And it\u2019s shocking that somebody like me, for example, who doesn\u2019t know which end of the gun to hold, could go into a store in Arizona, where I live, and pick up a fancy gun and hand it over to somebody from a Mexican cartel. Basically, things like that are a curse for the world. And it just has to be cured. The history of this is worth remembering. In the 19th century, there was no gun culture. People had guns. After all, it was an agricultural country, so farmers had old muskets to chase coyotes away and so on, but there was no gun culture. What happened apparently \u2014 and there is a good study of this by historian Pamela Haag, who has examined this in some detail \u2014 is that gun manufacturers were facing an economic crisis. The American Civil War provided a huge market for fancy modern guns. European states were at war, they were buying up guns. But the Civil War ended, and Europe went into a temporary quiescent state. There were not a lot of wars and fighting and so the market dried up. So, they hit on the idea of trying to create a market through advertising. The first great advertising campaign began with concocting an image of the \u201cWild West,\u201d the kind of thing that I grew up with. There was Wyatt Earp, a sheriff who was quick on the draw, or there was the Lone Ranger who would ride to the rescue. There was nothing remotely like this in the West, but it was invented and had a big effect. I can remember it from my childhood, and we all believed it. Of course, the bottom line of all of this was that you better buy your son a fancy rifle, or he won\u2019t be a \u201creal man.\u201d Well, that established the basis for a kind of gun culture, and it was copied by other advertising campaigns. We all remember the Marlboro Man. You know, you want to poison yourself with cigarettes and be like a cowboy who runs to the rescue. And it turned out to be very effective. The tobacco campaign killed \u2014 though nobody knows, probably millions of people \u2014 and the gun culture is still killing people at a horrific rate, which was all escalated by the Supreme Court in 2008 \u2014 theDistrict of Columbia v. Heller\u2014 where Justice Antonin Scalia reversed 100 years of precedent and reinterpreted the Second Amendment to grant free access to guns by individuals. Scalia was an originalist, a textualist. The idea here is that you don\u2019t pay attention to what the people who introduced the legislation meant by it; you\u2019re not allowed to do that. You just have to look at the text, not what it meant to the people who wrote it. That\u2019s illegitimate, not true scholarship. So, he looked at the text and tried to show that somebody living in the 18th century would have interpreted the Second Amendment to mean disregard for militias. True or false, it\u2019s totally irrelevant. We know exactly why the founders instituted the Second Amendment. One reason was the British Army. They were the main force in the world. The U.S. barely had an army, and the British might come right back. In fact, they did a few years later, and one had to have militias to call up to protect oneself against the British. The second reason was slavery. In places like South Carolina, enslaved Black people outnumbered white people. And there were slave rebellions going on all over the Caribbean, and they could spread here. In fact, they did. So, white people decided they needed guns for militias. But the main reason was aggression and genocide. One of the main reasons for the American Revolution was that King George III had instituted a royal proclamation which banned the colonists from going to the territory of the Indian Nations. They were not supposed to invade them. Colonists were supposed to stay east of the Appalachians, but they didn\u2019t want that. They wanted to kill and displace the American Indian people. They could then settle out there. Land speculators like George Washington wanted to move out. As soon as the British were gone, well, the white settlers needed militias, they needed guns. Later on, the army was created, the cavalry took care of it, and through the 19th century, Indigenous nations were destroyed, attacked and expelled. They needed lots of guns for that. You see, that\u2019s why the founders needed guns, but we\u2019re not allowed to talk about that. Instead, we generally say what someone like Scalia thinks someone would\u2019ve understood by the Second Amendment. And now that has become holy writ. Most people in the U.S., if you ask them what\u2019s in the Constitution, the first thing they\u2019ll say is the Second Amendment. It has just become a dominant part of the culture."

After a year of correspondence with Chomsky, I asked him if I could visit him in Boston. I talked to him at MIT, I told him more or less what I understood about them, and told him that they were the two wisest characters I knew and that it was a pity they hadn\u2019t met.

How did you analyze this representativeness crisis?",
    "output": "There are people who are now saying that democracy is in crisis and their approach on this point is that it is not democracy itself, but representative democracy. Why: because if we go back to classical Greece -which is a subject that Pepe regularly touches- where democracy was born, you will see that what we understand today as democracy, which is voting every four years for who decides everything else, has nothing to do with classical Greek democracy. It is a fiction to call democracy to vote every four years for who decides everything else. In that sense, both Pepe and Chomsky agree on something that, it seems to me, they are the only ones who are clearly stating: that, in opposition to the individualist and competitive culture of capitalism, of neoliberalism above all, which is a completely antisocial culture, they propose a more collective-collaborative logic. And from that point of view it is assumed, going back to the point of democracy, that democracy must be what we now call \u201cparticipative democracy\u201d. That is, to extend public interest decision-making to citizens so that they can progressively make more decisions about their own lives and that would be participatory democracy. That would be the only thing that really is democracy and, in that sense, the lack of that participation within democracy is what has led us not only to all the social setbacks that we have experienced with greater intensity during neoliberalism but also to democracy becoming completely blurred. In this sense it is notorious that people do not feel represented in the fact that there are permanent social protests with or without a leader. People continue to locate the needs they have, the faults, the failures, the violations of human rights, labor rights, etc., without the need to promote a particular political project, but by promoting all of them in a massive way the unsatisfied individual needs. If we were to have a participatory democracy, perhaps the technology with which we are living now, social networks above all, is setting a precedent and demanding a change in the political dynamics of our countries... That is correct. I believe that particularly the millennial generation, not to mention the centennial, the youngest, were born in the era of the Internet. This means: we have a communicational logic very different from previous generations. This communicational logic is precisely an argument against representative democracy. In other words, I believe that, for us, the concept of representative democracy is unnatural. Although I still don\u2019t see that concept well spread massively and that\u2019s what worries and occupies me. Knowing that we can participate anywhere in the world in less than a second, the logic of having to represent ourselves because we can\u2019t make our own decisions, because we can\u2019t find out or inform ourselves loses sense. In this way, whether conscious or unconscious, I believe that representative democracy, especially for the youngest, comes out of the scheme of the logical or the necessary. Now, I also believe that this concept of participatory democracy, with the use of technology, has not yet been consolidated, because there is no mass action, or a concrete example where this is working as a guide. However, we see different elements that do shape it, such as the fact that we now have the facility to inform ourselves: practically nothing escapes from us now. We have the capacity to inform ourselves when a policeman fires a bullet in the eyes of a person without any justification in a demonstration... all these things, but at the end of the day, since technology has two sides, all this amount of information not only allows us to see everything, but also allows for an enormous amount of lies to be out there. So technology is a challenge in itself. I believe that we must shape the concept much more massively among us young people, that we must organize ourselves democratically through technology, but I believe that it is a struggle that has yet to be given, that there is still a long way to go in that direction."

    "output": "One thing Pepe says is that the issue of democracy and the politicization of one\u2019s own people is like any muscle, that if you don\u2019t exercise it, it will never get stronger. In that sense, lies have always existed, with or without the Internet and the intention of manipulating people based on false or embezzled information has always existed. Participatory democracy not only opens up the possibility for people to have a say in certain circumstances that determine their own lives, but also for people to become politicized during their own exercise of it and that exercise allows people to have a more critical judgment in which to discern lies and truths, which will always be on the political and social planes, to evaluate the decisions we make. Did you talk about how it could be implemented? It is one thing to make it a relevant idea and another to think about how to implement it. In government terms, the message was this: use technology, get together, experiment. There are many things to do, but there is no concrete answer. The path is simply clear, we are going that way: let\u2019s promote those public policies that allow us citizens to have power in decisions of public interest. We also analyze the issue of the economy, the market and the workplace a great deal. Something that was very reiterated and that I am very interested in taking out in the documentary is the issue of the cooperative economy. Because democracy is not reproduced only in our home, with our families or out there in the park. It is reproduced where we adults spend most of our time, which is in our jobs. And our work in the corporation or the classic private enterprise are the most hierarchical sociostructural example you can find. In other words, you can work to democratize the government, but 100% of the political spectrum is there. As long as we do not democratize the place where we work, it will not be possible for us to reproduce a democratic society. And how is the workplace democratized? Migrating from the classic logic of private enterprise, which is imminently hierarchical, to cooperative enterprises. That model where the workers are also owners of the company and have a voice and vote in the decisions because it is their job and all the decisions that are taken affects them, have repercussions on them. That is why not only the government but also the place where we work must be a democratic place in order to reproduce a democratic society."

The labor movement was reviving. It had been crushed by force during the 1920s, but it was reviving. There were militant labor actions, there were political parties, radical political parties. There was debate, discussion, cultural activities. There was a sense of: \u201cWe can all get out of this together.\u201d In fact, if you look at what happened in the 1930s, the effect in Europe was fascism, Franco, Mussolini, Hitler, other minor figures. That was Europe. The reaction to the Depression in the United States was social democracy. The New Deal, Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, pressed by labor activism, popular pressure, led to the modern era of social democracy, picked up by Europe after the Second World War.

    "output": "A.They have taken over. I mean, they always dominate the system, of course, in Spain as well. But in the last 40 years, they\u2019ve had an overwhelming triumph in gaining power and wealth. Just take a look at some of the numbers. In the United States, the Rand Corporation, a very respected quasi-governmental corporation, did a study of the transfer of wealth from the working class and the middle class. Their estimate is $50 trillion, $50 trillion stolen from the working class and the middle class, and put into the pockets of the super rich, and the people that run and own the corporate sector. That\u2019s pretty substantial. And that\u2019s an underestimate. Reagan opened the door to tax havens, for example, lots of other ways to rob the public. There has been a major period of massive class war, and they have gained enormous power. It\u2019s been very destructive to the population of working people in the United States. Male workers, for their wages, are actually, in real terms, about where they were in 1979. A lot of wealth has been accumulated, but it\u2019s gone into very few pockets. Europe had its own form of this. The austerity programs in Europe badly damaged working people and the poor, and enriched the very rich, not as extreme as the United States, but it happened. It\u2019s led to anger, resentment, what\u2019s called populism, which is very different from traditional populism, but a sense that, \u201cThe world\u2019s going wrong, we don\u2019t like it.\u201d This is fertile terrain for demagogues of the Trump/Orban variety, and they\u2019re capitalizing on it."

    "output": "The assault on the Capitol was an effort to overthrow an elected government. Very explicitly, their claim was coming from Trump that the election was stolen, so let\u2019s march on the Capitol and save our country from the stolen election. Well, an effort to overthrow an elected government is what\u2019s called a coup. It almost succeeded. It\u2019s now been reported extensively. We have videotapes, we have details. A few people, Republicans, in fact, refused to go along, and prevented the coup from succeeding. But it has been followed by a soft coup, which is taking place before our eyes. You read about it every day. The Republicans are planning carefully to ensure that next time, their coup will succeed. They\u2019re doing it very systematically, perfectly in the open, at the state level where elections take place, trying to ensure that the people who run the elections physically are there when you cast your vote, the election monitors make sure that they are right-wing Republicans, who will ensure that if people vote the wrong way, the vote won\u2019t be counted. The Republican Party is no longer a political party. It\u2019s a neofascist party. The United States is a technologically advanced society, and culturally advanced, in some sectors, but culturally pre-modern in other sectors. That\u2019s Trump\u2019s voters, and he\u2019s a very effective demagogue. He has succeeded in tapping the poisons that run right under the surface in American society, bringing them to the surface, mobilizing them. They are now a group who worship Il Duce, the leader chosen by God. He\u2019s got them in his control. Those are the ones who stormed the Capitol, and are now planning to ensure that next time it\u2019ll work. American democracy is in very serious danger."

The major Biden program [Build Back Better], the one that\u2019s being thought about right now, was initiated by Sanders. In social welfare, the United States is a laggard, way behind other countries. Take such simple things as maternity leave. There are about six countries that don\u2019t have it, the United States, and a couple of Pacific islands. Everybody else has it. The United States? Can\u2019t have it. Republicans? 100% opposed. The Democrats like [Senator Joe] Manchin have blocked it.

    "output": "A.Like virtually every term of political discourse, the term \u201canarchism\u201d is used in widely different ways. The same is true of liberal, conservative, socialist, Marxist, they mean all sorts of things. In the case of anarchism, the idea is that any form of hierarchy, domination, authority, whatever it may be, in any aspect of life, from the family, to international affairs, any such relationship has to justify itself. It\u2019s not self-justifying. So if a community, decides democratically that they want to have traffic rules, drive on the right side of the road, stop at a red light, I think they\u2019re subjecting themselves to authority. But I think you can argue that it\u2019s legitimate authority. On the other hand, very few relationships withstand this critique. And the task of an anarchist is first of all, to discover them, which is not a small task, reveal them, to bring people to contemplate and deliberate about them, and then, to change them, if they find them legitimate. Even that first step, discovery, is not easy, right at the present time. So if you had asked my grandmother whether she was oppressed, she wouldn\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about. She was living the way a woman was supposed to live, taking care of the house, taking care of the children, doing what her husband tells her. That\u2019s not oppression, that\u2019s just life. Well, to discover that that\u2019s a form of oppression takes work and effort."

Stalin couldn\u2019t have told people that you\u2019re allowed to take a five-minute bathroom break or that you\u2019re not allowed to talk to that person next to you. And maybe your master is kind enough to allow you the leeway, but it\u2019s the master\u2019s decision. That\u2019s called getting a job. Today, most people think that\u2019s the norm. They react like my grandmother did, and would, if you\u2019d asked her if she was oppressed. That wasn\u2019t always true. To go back to the early Industrial Revolution of working people, bitterly opposed this form of autocracy, which was taking away their dignity, their rights and keeps reviving today. Plenty of people are saying the same thing. In fact, many of the people who are just refusing to go back to work, the so-called Great Resignation, are saying it in their own way."

NATO figures have claimed that Russian forces have already suffered as many deaths as they did during the entire duration of the Afghan war, and the position of the Zelenskyy government now seems to be \u201cpeace with victory.\u201d Obviously, the West\u2019s support for Ukraine is key to what\u2019s happening on the ground, both militarily and in terms of diplomatic solutions. Indeed, there is no clear path to peace, and the Kremlin has stated that it is not seeking to end the war by May 9 (known as Victory Day, which marks the Soviets\u2019 role in defeating Nazi Germany). Don\u2019t Ukrainians have the right to fight to death before surrendering any territory to Russia, if they choose to do so?",
    "output": "To my knowledge, no one has suggested that Ukrainians don\u2019t have that right. Islamic Jihad also has the abstract right to fight to the death before surrendering any territory to Israel. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it, but it\u2019s their right. Do Ukrainians want that? Perhaps now in the midst of a devastating war, but not in the recent past. President Zelenskyy was elected in 2019 with an overwhelming mandate for peace. He immediately moved to carry it out, with great courage. He had to confront violent right-wing militias who threatened to kill him if he tried to reach a peaceful settlement along the lines of the Minsk II formula. Historian of Russia Stephen Cohen points out that if Zelenskyy had been backed by the U.S., he could have persisted, perhaps solving the problem with no horrendous invasion. The U.S. refused, preferring its policy of integrating Ukraine within NATO. Washington continued to dismiss Russia\u2019s red lines and the warnings of a host of top-level U.S. diplomats and government advisers as it has been doing since Clinton\u2019s abrogation of Bush\u2019s firm and unambiguous promise to Gorbachev that in return for German reunification within NATO, NATO would not expand one inch beyond Germany. Zelenskyy also sensibly proposed putting the very different Crimea issue on a back burner, to be addressed later, after the war ends. Minsk II would have meant some kind of federal arrangement, with considerable autonomy for the Donbass region, optimally in a manner to be determined by an internationally supervised referendum. Prospects have of course diminished after the Russian invasion. How much we don\u2019t know. There is only one way to find out: to agree to facilitate diplomacy instead of undermining it, as the U.S. continues to do. It\u2019s true that \u201cthe West\u2019s support for Ukraine is key to what\u2019s happening on the ground, both militarily and in terms of diplomatic solutions,\u201d though I would suggest a slight rephrasing: The West\u2019s support for Ukraine is key to what\u2019s happening on the ground, both militarily and in terms ofundermining instead of facilitatingdiplomatic solutions that might end the horror. Congress, including congressional Democrats, are acting as if they prefer the exhortation by Democratic Chair of the House Permanent Select Committee of Intelligence Adam Schiff that we have to aid Ukraine \u201cso that we can fight Russia over there, and we don\u2019t have to fight Russia here.\u201d Schiff\u2019s warning is nothing new. It is reminiscent of Reagan\u2019s calling a national emergency because the Nicaraguan army is only two days marching time from Harlingen, Texas, about to overwhelm us. Or LBJ\u2019s plaintive plea that we have to stop them in Vietnam or they will \u201csweep over the United States and take what we have.\u201d That\u2019s been the permanent plight of the U.S., constantly threatened with annihilation.

And last week, President Biden asked Congress to approve $33 billion to Ukraine, which is more than double what Washington has already committed since the start of the war. Isn\u2019t it therefore safe to conclude that Washington has a lot riding on the way the war ends in Ukraine?",
    "output": "Since the relevant facts are virtually unspeakable here, it\u2019s worth reviewing them. Since the Maidan uprising in 2014, NATO (meaning basically the U.S.) has \u201cprovided significant support with equipment, with training, 10s of 1000s of Ukrainian soldiers have been trained, and then when we saw the intelligence indicating a highly likely invasion Allies stepped up last autumn and this winter,\u201d before the invasion, according to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg). I\u2019ve already mentioned Washington\u2019s refusal to back newly elected President Zelenskyy when his courageous effort to implement his mandate to pursue peace was blocked by right-wing militias, and the U.S. refused to back him, preferring to continue its policy of integrating Ukraine into NATO, dismissing Russia\u2019s red lines. As we\u2019ve discussed earlier, that commitment was stepped up with the official U.S. policy statement of September 2021 calling for sending more advanced military equipment to Ukraine while continuing \u201cour robust training and exercise program in keeping with Ukraine\u2019s status as a NATO Enhanced Opportunities Partner.\u201d The policy was given further formal status in the November 10 U.S.-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The State Department has acknowledged that \u201cprior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States made no effort to address one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s most often stated top security concerns \u2014 the possibility of Ukraine\u2019s membership into NATO.\u201d So matters continued after Putin\u2019s criminal aggression. Once again, what happened has been reviewed accurately by Anatol Lieven: U.S. strategy of using the war in Ukraine to weaken Russia is also of course completely incompatible with the search for a ceasefire and even a provisional peace settlement. It would require Washington to oppose any such settlement and to keep the war going. And indeed, when in late March the Ukrainian government put forward a very reasonable set of peace proposals, the lack of public U.S. support for them was extremely striking. Apart from anything else, a Ukrainian treaty of neutrality (as proposed by President Zelensky) is an absolutely inescapable part of any settlement \u2014 but weakening Russia involves maintaining Ukraine as a de facto U.S. ally. U.S. strategy as indicated by [Defense Secretary] Lloyd Austin would risk Washington becoming involved in backing Ukrainian nationalist hardliners against President Zelensky himself. With this in mind, we can turn to the question. The answer seems plain: judging by U.S. actions and formal pronouncements, it is \u201csafe to conclude that Washington has a lot riding on the way the war ends in Ukraine.\u201d More specifically, it is fair to conclude that in order to \u201cweaken Russia,\u201d the U.S. is dedicated to the grotesque experiment that we have discussed earlier; avoid any way of ending the conflict through diplomacy and see whether Putin will slink away quietly in defeat or will use the capacity, which of course he has, to destroy Ukraine and set the stage for terminal war. We learn a lot about the reigning culture from the fact that the grotesque experiment is considered highly praiseworthy, and that any effort to question it is either relegated to the margins or bitterly castigated with an impressive flow of lies and deceit."

    "input": "C. J. Polychroniou:Noam, with every passing month, the conflict in Ukraine looks much grimmer. Both the U.S. and the EU are now deeply involved in the war, and Biden has already pledged to support Ukraine for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d to defeat Russia on the battlefield. In the meantime, Zelenskyy has made some new demands for peace, but they were quickly rejected by Moscow with the argument that Kyev must take into account the current reality. Are there any historical analogies that could be useful in seeing how this war might possibly end?",
    "output": "There are all too many analogues: Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya, Gaza, Eastern Congo, Somalia \u2014 just keeping to ongoing horrors where the U.S. and its allies have a primary or at least substantial role in perpetrating and sustaining them. Such examples, however, are not relevant to discussion of Ukraine in polite circles. They suffer from the fallacy of wrong agency: us not them. Therefore, benign intent gone awry and not reincarnation of Hitler. Since this is all a priori truth, it is not subject to discussion any more than 2+2 = 4. The analogues do offer some unhappy suggestions as to how this war might possibly end: by not ending until devastation is so extreme that we wouldn\u2019t want to think about it. That unfortunately seems more than likely with each passing day. I claim no military expertise. I do follow military analysts, and find most of them supremely confident, with opposing conclusions \u2014 not for the first time. My suspicion is that General Milley, former chair of the joint chiefs, is probably right in concluding that neither side can win a decisive military victory and that the cost of continuing warfare is enormous for both sides, with many repercussions beyond. If the war goes on, Ukraine will be the primary victim. Advanced U.S. weapons may sustain a battlefield stalemate as Russia pours in more troops and equipment, but how much can Ukrainian society tolerate now that Russia, after many months, has turned to the U.S.-U.K. style of war, directly attacking infrastructure, energy, communications, anything that allows the society to function? Ukraine is already facing a major economic and humanitarian crisis. As the war persists, Ukrainian central bank officials fear that \u201cPeople could flee Ukraine in droves, taking their money with them, potentially crashing the national currency as they seek to exchange their Ukrainian hryvnia for euros or dollars.\u201d Fortunately, ethnic Ukrainians who flee are likely to be accepted in the West. They are considered to be (almost) white, unlike those left to drown by the thousands in the Mediterranean while fleeing from Europe\u2019s destruction of Africa, or forcefully returned to U.S.-backed terrorist states. While many may be able to flee, as matters now stand destruction of a viable society in Ukraine is likely to continue on its gruesome path. Talk of nuclear weapons is almost all in the West, though it\u2019s all too easy to think of steps up the escalation ladder. The casual talk about nuclear war in the U.S. is shocking, disastrous. So is the now standard line about a cosmic struggle between democracy and autocracy \u2014 eliciting ridicule outside of Western educated circles. Elsewhere, people are capable of looking at the glaringly obvious facts of past and current history and are not so deeply immersed in doctrinal fabrications that they are rendered blind. The same is true of the tales concocted in Western propaganda about Putin\u2019s plans to conquer Europe, if not beyond, eliciting fears that coexist easily with gloating over the demonstration of Russia\u2019s military incompetence and inability even to conquer towns a few miles from its borders. Orwell called it \u201cdoublethink\u201d: the ability to hold two contradictory ideas in mind and firmly believe them both. Western doublethink is buttressed by the industry of tea leaf-reading that seeks to penetrate Putin\u2019s twisted mind, discerning all sorts of perversities and grand ambitions. The industry reverses George W. Bush\u2019s discoveries when he looked into Putin\u2019s eyes, saw his soul and recognized it to be good. And it is about as well-grounded as Bush\u2019s insights. But reality doesn\u2019t go away. Apart from the destruction of Ukraine, there is an ever-growing possibility of nuclear war. Millions are facing starvation from disruption of grain and fertilizer shipments from the Black Sea region. Precious resources that are desperately needed to avert climate catastrophe are being wasted in destruction and sharply increased preparation for more. Europe is taking a beating, with its very natural complementary relation with Russia broken, and links to the emerging China-based system harmed as well. It\u2019s an open question whether Europe \u2014 in particular the German-based industrial system \u2014 will agree to decline by subordinating itself to Washington, a topic of far-reaching importance. That prospect goes beyond Ukraine-Russia. Biden\u2019s virtual declaration of war against China, with sanctions against exports to China of technology that makes use of U.S. components or designs, hits European industry hard, particularly the advanced chip-manufacturing industry in the Netherlands. So far it is not clear whether European industry will be willing to pay the costs of the U.S. effort to prevent China\u2019s economic development \u2014 framed, as usual, in terms of national security, but only the most loyal partisans can take that claim seriously. Meanwhile the U.S. is gaining enormously in multiple ways: geopolitically by Putin\u2019s self-destructive decision to drive Europe into Washington\u2019s pocket by ignoring very real possibilities for avoiding criminal aggression, but also in other ways. It is not, of course, the U.S. population that is gaining. Rather, those in charge: fossil fuel industries, financial institutions that invest in them, military producers, the agribusiness semi-monopolies, and masters of the economy generally, who can scarcely control their euphoria over bulging profits (which are feeding inflation with markups) and great prospects for moving on to destroy human society on earth more expeditiously. It\u2019s easy to understand why almost the whole world is calling for negotiations and a diplomatic settlement, including most of Europe, as polls indicate. Ukrainians will decide for themselves. As to what they prefer, we have clear statements by the government, but know little about the general population. The highly regarded correspondent Jonathan Steele brings to our attention a Gallup telephone poll of Ukrainians in September. It found that \u201cAlthough 76 per cent of men wanted the war to continue until Russia is forced to leave all occupied territory including Crimea, and 64 per cent of women had the same view, the rest \u2014 a substantial number of people \u2014 wanted negotiations.\u201d Regional analysis showed that \u201cIn areas closest to the front lines where the horror of war is felt most keenly people\u2019s doubts about the wisdom of fighting until victory are highest. Only 58 per cent support it in southern Ukraine. In the east the figure is as low as 56 per cent.\u201d Are there possibilities for diplomacy? The U.S. and the U.K., the two traditional warrior states, are still insisting that the war must be fought to severely weaken Russia, hence no negotiations, but even in their inner circles there is some softening in this regard. Right now, the positions of the two adversaries seem irreconcilable, having predictably hardened as hostilities escalate. We don\u2019t know whether it is possible to return to the positions of last March, when, according to Ukrainian left sources, \u201cUkraine had publicly announced proposals to the Istanbul meeting on March 29, which included the withdrawal of Russian troops to the line on February 23 and the postponement of discussion about Crimea and Donbas. At the same time, the Ukrainian side insisted that all disputes should be resolved through transparent referendums held under the supervision of international observers and after the return of all forcibly displaced persons.\u201d The Istanbul negotiations collapsed. The source just quoted places the blame totally on Russia. Little is known, since coverage of diplomatic efforts is so scanty. In particular, we do not know whether a factor in the collapse was Britain\u2019s opposition to negotiations, apparently backed by the U.S. Do possibilities remain? The only way to find out is to facilitate efforts to try. At the very least we can remove obstacles to diplomacy that the U.S. has placed, topics we\u2019ve reviewed in detail. And we can try to foster an arena of open discussion about these topics, free from tantrums and heroic posturing about high principles that dismisses the factual record and human consequences. There are many pitfalls and dangers, but it\u2019s hard to see what other course can save Ukraine, and far beyond, from catastrophe."

Is there any evidence that Putin\u2019s regime is interested in reviving the Russian empire? And what happens if Russia is not defeated in the battlefield? Will Europe be dragged into a new Cold War? Indeed, does the U.S./NATO-Russia conflict over Ukraine prove that the Cold War perhaps never ended?",
    "output": "Scholz surely knows better. Whatever one thinks of Russian war aims, they were explicit and far narrower, and Scholz, who is well-informed, cannot fail to be aware of that. The tea leaf-reading industry has seized on occasional comments by Putin, generally taken out of context, to conjure up the frightening images of Russia on the march. That requires an impressive subordination to doublethink, as just described. The Cold War briefly ended when the Soviet Union collapsed. The Gorbachev-Bush I negotiations, supported by Germany, provided a basis for escaping its legacy. The hopes did not long survive. We should not overlook the fact that the end of the Cold War also lifted the ideological clouds \u2014 briefly. Government documents recognized, indirectly, that the Cold War was in large part a tacit agreement between the superpowers to allow each to use violence when necessary to control its own domains: for Russia, eastern Europe; for the U.S., much of the world. Thus, the Bush I administration officially recognized that we have to maintain intervention forces aimed at the Middle East, where the serious problems \u201ccould not be laid at the Kremlin\u2019s door,\u201d contrary to decades of prevarication. Rather, they were the usual threat: independent nationalism. That didn\u2019t change, apart from the need to design new pretexts, the menacing Russian hordes having evaporated: \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d and other concoctions, lauded at home and bitterly denounced by the Global South, the traditional victims. All reviewed in detail elsewhere. The official Cold War briefly ended. Bush I lived up to his promises to Gorbachev, but Clinton almost immediately rescinded them, initiating the expansion of NATO to Russia\u2019s borders in violation of firm and unambiguous promises. He did so for domestic political reasons (the Polish vote etc.) as he explained to his friend Boris Yeltsin. There should be no need to review again the rest of the sordid story until today. The hope for a \u201ccommon European home\u201d with no military alliances \u2014 Gorbachev\u2019s vision, tolerated by Bush I \u2014 was undermined by Clinton, and a form of Cold War then developed, now becoming extremely dangerous."

U.S.-U.K. military analysts also expressed their surprise that Russia was not launching their kind of war, with immediate resort to the \u201chideous types of military operations\u201d you mention. It was not hard to predict, as we did over the months, that sooner or later Russia would resort to U.S.-U.K.-Israeli tactics: Quickly destroy everything that sustains a viable society. So they are now doing, arousing justified horror among decent people \u2014 joined by those who implement or justify these tactics with the \u201cright agency\u201d: us. The strategic incentive is clear enough, especially after Russia\u2019s battlefield setbacks: Destroy the economy and the will to resist. All familiar to us. Quite definitely war crimes, whether in Iraq, or Gaza, or Ukraine. It\u2019s not surprising that Ukraine is seeking to strike back against Russia. So far, the U.S. government, apparently under Pentagon advice, is seeking to restrict those reactions, not sharing the willingness to see the world go up in flames expressed by many commentators in the current crazed environment."

Polychroniou: Noam, it\u2019s been already 14 months into Donald Trump\u2019s turbulent White House tenure, but sometimes we still need to pinch ourselves to make sure that it\u2019s not a nightmare that a racist, misogynist, homophobic man who apparently cares only about himself runs the world\u2019s most powerful nation. But, really, how bad is it having Trump in the White House?",
    "output": "Very bad. As Trump began his second year in office, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists advanced their Doomsday Clock to two minutes to midnight, citing increasing concerns over nuclear weapons and climate change. That\u2019s the closest it has been to terminal disaster since 1953, when the US and USSR exploded thermonuclear weapons. That was before the release of Trump\u2019s Nuclear Posture Review, which significantly increases the dangers by lowering the threshold for nuclear attack and by developing new weapons that increase the danger of terminal war. On climate change, Trump is a complete disaster, along with the entire Republican leadership. Every candidate in the Republican primaries either denied that what is happening is happening or said ... we shouldn\u2019t do anything about it. And these attitudes infect the Republican base. Half of Republicans deny that global warming is taking place, while 70 percent say that whether it is or not, humans are not responsible. Such figures would be shocking anywhere, but are remarkably so in a developed country with unparalleled resources and easy access to information. It is hard to find words to describe the fact that the most powerful country in world history is not only withdrawing from global efforts to address a truly existential threat, but is also dedicating itself to accelerating the race to disaster, all to put more dollars in overstuffed pockets. No less astounding is the limited attention paid to the phenomenon. When we turn to matters of great though lesser import, the conclusion is the same: disaster. While Trump\u2019s antics occupy the attention of the media, his associates in Congress have been working intensively to advance the interests of their actual constituency \u2014 extreme wealth and corporate power \u2014 while dismantling what is of value to the general population and future generations. With justice, the Republican leadership regard the tax bill as their greatest triumph. Joseph Stiglitz rightly describes the triumph as \u201cThe US Donor Relief Act of 2017,\u201d a vast giveaway to their actual constituency \u2014 and to themselves. As he points out, the Republican leaders \u201care stuffing themselves at the trough \u2014 Trump, Kushner and many others in his administration are among the biggest winners \u2014 thinking that this may be their last chance at such a feast.\u201d And \u201cApr\u00e8s moi, le deluge\u201d \u2014 literally in this case. The grand triumph brings an extra advantage. It explodes the deficit (a trademark of Republicans since Reagan), which means that they can move on to cut away at entitlements, as the chief architect, Paul Ryan, announced happily at once. The US already ranks near the bottom of the [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries \u2014 the 35 richer and more developed countries \u2014 in social justice measures. The Republican triumph will sink it even lower. The tax scam is only the most prominent of the devices being implemented under the cover of Trump buffoonery to serve wealth and corporate power while harming the irrelevant population. Many other policies are simply [unconscionable], such as Trump\u2019s initiative to have the Department of Homeland Security separate children, even infants, from their mothers in order to discourage immigration \u2014 700 families have been split in this fashion since October, a New York Times investigation found. Many of these families are fleeing from the murderous consequences of US policies: Honduras has been the main source of refugee flight since the US, almost alone, endorsed the military coup that ousted the elected president and the fraudulent election that followed, initiating a reign of terror. We also must endure the sight of Trump wailing in terror because a caravan of victims reached Mexico, most hoping to settle there. Trump\u2019s suggestion that these victims are threatening the security of the US is reminiscent of Reagan strapping on his cowboy boots and calling a national emergency because Nicaraguan troops were a two days march from Texas, and about to overwhelm us. It\u2019s amazing that such performances do not evoke profound national embarrassment."

    "output": "In some cases, yes. He is fulfilling the wishes of the Evangelicals who are a large part of his voting base. He is greatly increasing the military budget, as he promised. ... Most of his promises are about as close to fulfillment as his commitment to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d which is now overflowing. [Scott] Pruitt\u2019s [Environmental Protection Agency] alone is a cesspool, though its dismantling of efforts to deal with the impact of climate change are far more serious than the wholesale robbery, which seems to be a Pruitt specialty from well before he was handed the wrecking ball. On trade, though the policies, insofar as they are coherent, are generally harmful, the rhetoric is not completely false. Thus it is true that China is using devices that violate World Trade Organization rules \u2014 devices that were critical to the growth of the rich societies, from England to the US and beyond, and are now banned by the investor rights agreements mislabeled \u201cfree trade agreements.\u201d This is a textbook illustration of what economic historians call \u201ckicking away the ladder\u201d: First we climb up, then we kick the ladder away so that you can\u2019t follow. And Trump is right that the [North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)] should be revised. Some sensible proposals have been put forth by the partners in NAFTA. For example, Canada has proposed that the revised NAFTA should ban harsh US anti-labor laws, like the right-to-scrounge laws called \u201cright-to-work\u201d in contemporary Newspeak. These laws are soon to become federal policy, it seems, under the reactionary Roberts Court, which was made more extreme by [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell\u2019s shameful parliamentary maneuvers to prevent even consideration of Obama\u2019s nomination, opening the way to the appointment of Neil Gorsuch \u2014 another gift to the far right. The Canadian proposal was prominently reported in the major Canadian press, but, oddly, is missing from the discussions of NAFTA revision here, which keep to Trump proposals."

What\u2019s your take on all this, and what does Trump\u2019s disrespect for law and the fact that his base is refusing to abandon him tell us about the current state of American democracy and US politics in general?",
    "output": "We don\u2019t need Comey to tell us that Trump is morally unfit. He made that abundantly clear in the primaries, if not before. The fact that the Oval Office is coming to resemble a schoolyard on a bad day may be obnoxious, but it doesn\u2019t rank high among the misdeeds of the administration, in my opinion. ... Same with his alleged ties to Russia and Putin. Much more serious is the clique that now surrounds him. It\u2019s a sad day when one has to hope that General [James] Mattis will keep the ... [rest] in check. The [John] Bolton appointment in particular should send shivers up the spine of any person. As for Trump\u2019s base, they are indeed quite loyal. Most Trump voters were relatively affluent and probably are fairly satisfied with the ultra-reactionary policies. Another important segment was non-college-educated whites, a group that voted overwhelmingly for Trump (a 40 percent advantage). There is a close analysis of this group in the current (Spring 2018) issue of the Political Science Quarterly. It found that racism and sexism were far more significant factors in their vote than economic issues. If so, this group has little reason to object to the scene that is unfolding, and the same with the white Evangelicals who gave Trump 80 percent of their vote. Among justly angry, white, working-class Trump voters, many apparently enjoy watching him stick his thumb in the eyes of the hated elites even if he doesn\u2019t fufill his promises to [working-class voters], which many never believed in the first place. What all this tells us, yet again, is that the neoliberal programs that have concentrated wealth in a few hands while the majority stagnate or decline have also severely undermined functioning democracy by familiar mechanisms, leading to anger, contempt for the dominant centrist political forces and institutions, and often anti-social attitudes and behavior \u2014 alongside of very promising popular reactions, like the remarkable [Bernie] Sanders phenomenon, [Jeremy] Corbyn in England and positive developments elsewhere as well."

    "input": "With regard to foreign affairs, what do you consider to be the most menacing elements of Trump\u2019s handling of US foreign policy?",
    "output": "Trump inherited multiple crises. His own policies have been largely incoherent, but he has been consistent in some areas, primarily the Middle East. He has provided strong support for the Saudi war in Yemen, a major catastrophe, and is exulting in the huge arms sales to the dictatorship. Last December, UN agencies warned that the Saudi blockade of Yemen could lead to \u201cone of the largest famines in modern times.\u201d Yemen already has the world\u2019s worst cholera outbreak, which is not under control. The Saudi blockade is hindering desperately needed imports of food, medicine and fuel. Apart from the human disaster it is creating, the Saudi dictatorship, always with firm US backing, seems intent on carrying forward the Taliban and ISIS projects of destroying precious antiquities. Reviewing the systematic Saudi destruction, the chair of Yemen\u2019s Organization of Antiquities and Museums charges that the attacks on 60 sites are \u201ca conscious campaign to wreck Yemen\u2019s heritage and demoralize its citizens.\u201d Western experts agree that the destruction seems deliberate, using information provided by the [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization] on cultural heritage sites to direct bombing attacks, with no military objective. The US-led attack on ISIS in Raqqa destroyed the city, and nothing is being done to reconstruct or help the victims. Under the influence of [US-UN Ambassador] Nikki Haley, one of the more sinister (and, it seems, ambitious) figures in the administration, Trump has sharply cut funding to the [United Nations Relief and Works Agency], which barely keeps millions of Palestinian refugees alive. In general, \u201cmake America great\u201d means great at destroying, and that\u2019s where the greatness ends. It\u2019s by no means entirely new, but is now raised to a higher level and becoming a matter of principle. In May, Trump will presumably refuse to renew sanctions relief for Iran, as required by the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA). That does not constitute formal withdrawal, though that\u2019s the likely effect. Even if the European signers formally persist, the consequences will be severe because of the central role of the US in the international financial system \u2014 not to speak of the danger that their persistence might arouse the ire of the unpredictable Trump, who can do a great deal of damage if crossed. Effective withdrawal might provide an opening for the new national security adviser, Bolton, a genuine war criminal who publicly calls for bombing Iran, presumably in collaboration with Israel and with tacit Saudi approval. Consequences could be horrendous. There is much fevered debate as to whether Iran might have violated the JCPOA, contrary to the firm conclusion of [the International Atomic Energy Agency] Director General Yukiya Amano on March 5, 2018, that \u201cIran is implementing its nuclear-related commitments.\u201d But we hear virtually nothing about US violations, though these have been clear enough. Thus the JCPOA commits the signers to support the successful implementation of the agreement, including in their public statements, and to refrain from any adverse effect on trade and economic relations with Iran that conflict with their commitments to successful implementation of the JCPOA. The US has been in flat violation of all of these commitments, which have serious consequences. Unmentionable as always is the obvious way to alleviate whatever threat Iranian nuclear programs are imagined to pose: establishing a nuclear weapons-free zone in the region. The way is clear. The proposal is strongly supported by Iran, the Arab states and the world generally. But there is an impediment. It has regularly been blocked by the US, for familiar reasons: Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons. Also ignored is that the US [and] UK have a special commitment to work for this goal, having committed themselves to it in the UN [Security Council] resolution they invoked in an effort to find some thread of justification for their invasion of Iraq. There is more to say about this troubled region, but there are crises elsewhere as well. One involves North Korea, and here there might be some rays of light. Trump has so far accepted the moves of the two Koreas toward improving relations, and has agreed to negotiations with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un that so far look promising. If these initiatives succeed, they might go as far as the September 2005 agreement in which North Korea pledged to abandon \u201call nuclear weapons and existing weapons programs.\u201d Unfortunately, the Bush administration immediately violated all of its commitments under the agreement, and North Korea proceeded with its nuclear weapons programs. We may hope that Trump will be willing to accept success in denuclearizing the peninsula and in further steps toward accommodation. And if he wants to brag about the achievement as a demonstration of his brilliance as a deal-maker, just fine. This by no means exhausts the foreign policy issues that should be seriously addressed \u2014 topics that would carry us far afield."

    "output": "Trumpism is one of many manifestations of the effects of the neoliberal policies of the past generation. These have led to extreme concentration of wealth along with stagnation for the majority. There have been repeated crashes of the deregulated financial institutions, each worse than the last. Bursting bubbles have been followed by huge public bailouts for the perpetrators while the victims have been abandoned. Globalization has been designed to set working people throughout the world in competition with one another while private capital is lavished with benefits. Democratic institutions have eroded. As already mentioned, all of this has led to anger, bitterness, often desperation \u2014 one remarkable effect is the increasing mortality among middle-age whites discovered by Anne Case and Angus Deaton, analyzed as \u201cdeaths of despair,\u201d a phenomenon unknown in functioning societies. While there are variations from place to place, some features are common. One is the decline of the centrist parties that have long dominated political life, as we see in election after election. In the US, in recent years, whenever candidates arose from the base in the Republican primaries, the established powers were able to crush them and impose their own choice: Mitt Romney, most recently. In 2016, for the first time they were unable to do so, but they quickly rallied to the winning candidate, who proved quite willing to front for the more brutal wing of the traditional party. The real surprise in the election was the Sanders campaign, which broke with a long tradition of pretty much bought elections, and was stopped only by machinations of the Obama-Clinton party managers. The Democratic Party is now split between the donor-oriented New Democrat managers and a growing activist social democratic base. What all of this portends, worldwide, is far from clear. Though there are also significant signs of hope, some commentators have \u2014 with good reason \u2014 been quoting Gramsci\u2019s observation from his prison cell: \u201cThe crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.\u201d"

    "input": "How much of a departure is the Trump presidency from the bipartisan Washington empire consensus \u2014 the way that the U.S. has been governed throughout its history?",
    "output": "There are some differences and many continuities. On the domestic scene, Trump is, very effectively, managing both of his constituencies. There\u2019s an authentic constituency of corporate power and private wealth and they\u2019re being served magnificently by the executive orders, legislative programs that are being pushed through which represent the more savage wing of the traditional Republican policies \u2014 catering to private interests, private wealth, and dismissing the rest as irrelevant and easily disposed of. At the same time, he\u2019s managing to maintain the voting constituency by pretending, very effectively, to be the one person in the world who stands up for them against the hated elites. And this is quite an impressive con job. How long he can carry it off? I don\u2019t know. On the international scene, it\u2019s actually more interesting. He\u2019s being lambasted for taking positions which, in my view, are pretty reasonable. So, for example, in the case of Korea: The two Koreas, last April 27th came out with a historic declaration, in which they laid out fairly explicit plans for moving towards reconciliation, integration, and denuclearization of the peninsula. Newscaster:Kim Jong-un made history today becoming the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since the Korean War began in 1950. He promised a new beginning as he met with South Korea\u2019s Moon Jae-in in the demilitarized zone between the two countries. The meeting marks the first summit between the Koreas in more than a decade. They pretty much pleaded with outsiders, that means the United States to permit them to proceed, as they put it, on their own accord. And so far Trump has not interfered with this very much, calling off temporarily at least the military exercises, which has he correctly said are highly provocative. He\u2019s been lambasted for that, but it\u2019s exactly the right position I think. Right now, the president Moon is in North Korea if they can make positive moves on their own accord as they\u2019ve requested that should be beneficial. In the case of Russia, it\u2019s more complexes. His policies have, in fact, been two-fold his administration has continued the policies of building up military forces on the Russian border, carrying out military maneuvers, increasing the tensions in extremely dangerous parts of the world. On the other hand, he has also taken somewhat conciliatory steps towards reducing tensions. And for that again, he\u2019s been lambasted. Though, I think it\u2019s the right thing to do. On other issue matters, he\u2019s torn up important international agreements, the most significant was the Iran nuclear agreement. DJT:I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. In a few moments, I will sign a presidential memorandum to begin reinstating U.S. nuclear sanctions on the Iranian regime. We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction. That\u2019s in isolation from the entire world, in this case. And that\u2019s very serious and the most serious of all, by far overshadowing everything else, is his pulling out of the Paris negotiations. DJT:The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries. Leaving American workers, who I love, and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production. Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. Leaves the United States as the only country in the world which is refusing officially to take even small steps towards dealing with the true existential crisis, and that\u2019s combined with the domestic programs of rapidly increasing the use of the most dangerous fossil fuels, cutting back regulations on economy for automobiles, eliminating safety protections for workers, and so on. All of that is just a race to disaster and that\u2019s by far the most serious of the initiatives to undermine what\u2019s loosely called the international order. Raising questions about NATO, for example, is quite a reasonable thing to do. One might certainly ask why NATO even exists after the collapse of the Soviet Union \u2014 not that there weren\u2019t questioned before, there were \u2014 but the official story was that NATO was in place to defend the West against the Russian hordes, which, putting aside the validity of that claim, that was the official stand Newsreel:The Russian cynical blockade of Berlin had brought Europe to the brink of War. It was at last clear that only a strong alliance could deter them from further adventures. On 4, April 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty was signed by Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Canada, and the United States. This union of 12 Nations became known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or more simply: NATO. After the Soviet Union collapsed, a fair question arose as to why NATO should survive. And what it did was, in fact, expand. Expanded all the way to the Russian border, initially under the first Bush, then extensively under Clinton, then by 2008 even offering to have Ukraine join NATO, that\u2019s an attack on Russian geostrategic interests that no Russian leader could easily accept. All of this increases threats, tensions quite unnecessarily, at the same time NATO changed its official mission to say what they call \u201csafeguard control\u201d of the international energy system, pipelines, and sea lanes, and though it\u2019s unmentioned to serve as essentially an intervention force for the United States. We have a good indication of how the world saw that international order. The Gallup polling agency takes international polls of international opinion every year \u2014 in 2013, for the first time, they asked an interesting question. They asked the question, which country is the greatest threat to World Peace. The United States was in first place. No other country was even close \u2014 far behind in second place was Pakistan that was doubtless inflated by the Indian vote. The countries that are called the greatest threat to World Peace here the United States like Iran were barely even mentioned. Interestingly, Gallop never asked that polling question again, and it was \u2014 the answer was not reported in the mainstream press."

There are books being published with backward \u201cRs\u201d on them, which isn\u2019t even in Cyrillic, it\u2019s not even actually the letter \u201cR,\u201d but there\u2019s this sort of portrayal of Putin as, sort of, the Bolsheviks rising and this idea that Russia is seeking to take over the United States, and Russia is responsible for Donald Trump being president because they quote-unquote hacked our election. What is true and what is hyperbole/propaganda/exaggeration about Russia and Putin, specifically, taking into account the U.S. posture toward Ukraine, NATO, but also the issue of electoral interference?",
    "output": "What is true is that after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990,1991, there was a period under Yeltsin in which the United States pretty much dominated what was happening in Russia and the region around Russia. NATO was expanded. The Russian economy totally collapsed under the imposed harsh market reforms. There was a radical collapse of the economy, sharp increase in the mortality rate. Russia was really devastated. When Putin came in\u2013\u2013he\u2019s not a nice guy. I would not like to have dinner with him, but you can understand his policies. His policies were to try to restore some role for Russia at least in its own region of the world, which we might recall happened to be the traditional invasion routes through which Russia was attacked virtually destroyed several times in the last century. So, this is not a small question. And yes, Putin is trying to restore some degree of Russian power in the world, some degree of Russian authority. One extension of that and, in fact, the only one is the Russian position in Syria. All of this encroaches on the global domination of the United States and secondarily, its allies, which is, kind of, taken to be the norm. The norm is, \u201cwe rule everything,\u201d and if someone else tries to control their own area that\u2019s disruptive of the international system. Which, from a certain point of view, it is. If you take a look at Russian power as compared with the United States, it\u2019s derisory. Just one indication: Trump\u2019s increase in defense budget practically reaches the entire Russian military budget. So, the idea of Russia taking over the world is ludicrous. What it means is that they are trying, often in ways that merit condemnation, but nevertheless, trying to restore some degree of Russian influence in the region surrounding Russia plus Syria, their one Mediterranean base. And to try to establish a place for Russia in the world system, far weaker than the United States, weaker than China. In fact, one of Russia\u2019s International problems is to keep from being overwhelmed by Chinese power. That\u2019s the kind of disruption of the international order that is attributed to Russia. JS:You raise this issue of Russia in Syria.

You do have a debate on the left in the United States about what a just position looks like toward the conflict in Syria. And, of course, you have isolationists, or Libertarians, or anti-imperialists who take the position of, \u201cThere should be total hands-off Syria that this is a civil war.\u201d I think the honest among us would say that of course, Bashar al-Assad is a war criminal. He is a mass murderer, but he is in a conflict with a lot of mass murderers and a lot of war criminals."

    "input": "What Noam Chomsky do you believe is a just position to take on the war in Syria? Is it that people should defend Bashar al-Assad with the idea that it\u2019s the least bad option, or that this is a matter that should be handled by the Syrians, or is there any international involvement that you think makes any sense, or could be justified under both moral principles and legal principles?",
    "output": "Well, the first point to bear in mind, which you already mentioned is that Assad is a horrible war criminal. The bulk of the atrocities, which are enormous, are his responsibility. There\u2019s no justifying Assad. On the other hand, the fact of the matter is that he is essentially pretty much in control of Syria now, thanks largely to Russian partially Iranian support. The Russians actually entered Syria extensively after the CIA had provided the rebel forces, which are mostly run by jihadi elements, provided them with advanced antitank missiles which were stymieing the Syrian Army at which point the Russians came in with air power and overwhelmed the opposition. The current situation is that Assad has pretty much won the war. Like it or not. There was in the early stages a Democratic secular, quite respectable opposition, but they were very quickly overwhelmed by the jihadi elements, supported from the outside \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United States, and others. There\u2019s a pending humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib, the province where the jihadis have been \u2014 the place to which they\u2019ve been expelled or fled. If there\u2019s a Syrian Russian attack on that it could be a total humanitarian catastrophe. There is some indication that the Russians and the Turks may have been provided a safe area to which maybe some civilians can flee but that looks like a monstrosity developing. If there\u2019s a way of countering that attack, it should be pursued by diplomatic means. The other crucial question is the status of the Kurdish areas \u2014 Rojava. In my opinion, it makes sense for the United States to maintain a presence which would deter an attack on the Kurdish areas. They have the one part of Syria which is succeeded in sustaining a functioning society with many decent elements. And the idea that they should be subjected to an attack by their bitter enemies the Turks, or by the murderous Assad regime I think is anything should be done to try to prevent that. JS:Let me ask you about that point because you are one of the leading people in the world that is consistently reminding the world that the United States has always adopted a posture of certain Kurds are good Kurds certain Kurds are bad Kurds and the United States has poured money and weapons into the coffers of for instance the Turkish military explicitly to be used for an ongoing attempt at genocide against the Kurds. So, I\u2019m curious how you reconcile that with a position that the United States would, in essence, be the protector of the Kurds in the context of the Syrian War. The United States, like other great powers, does not pursue humanitarian objectives. It pursues objectives determined by power considerations, and they lead to different positions with regard to the Kurds or others at different times. So, for example, in the 1970s there was a time when the United States supported Kurds against Saddam Hussein. Shortly after a deal was made in which they sacrificed the Kurds to Saddam Hussein. That led to Henry Kissinger\u2019s famous comment that we shouldn\u2019t confuse foreign policy with missionary activity. It\u2019s entirely true that especially in the 1990s Clinton was pouring arms into Turkey for the purpose of carrying out massive, murderous, destructive attacks against the Kurdish population of Turkey in the Southeast \u2014 enormously destructive. That does not change the fact that now the United States could, with a relatively small presence, deter attacks against the Kurds in Syria, which could destroy the one part of Syria that is actually functioning at a decent fashion. We don\u2019t expect consistency in humanitarian terms from a great power because those are not the guiding principles."

    "output": "Well my own view as you may recall back at the time was that the use of military force in Afghanistan was inappropriate and illegitimate. There were diplomatic options \u2014 they could have been pursued but the United States wanted to use force. I think the perhaps the most accurate description of what the United States did was by Abdul Haq \u2014 one of the most respected and honored of the Afghan anti-Taliban activists who in fact was killed in Afghanistan \u2014 who strongly opposed the U.S. bombing as most of the Afghan dissidents did, and argued that the United States was bombing just because it wanted to show its muscle and intimidate everyone else and it was undermining the efforts of the anti-Taliban Afghan resistance to solve the problem on their own. Newscaster:Working their way through the rush hour that morning two men were about to offer the U.S. government the chance to topple the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, to expel Al-Qaeda from its terrorist bases, and to capture Osama bin Laden. This plan had been put together by Abdul Haq one of Afghanistan\u2019s most respected leaders and was the culmination of Haq\u2019s lifetime struggle to save his country. I think his analysis was correct. We\u2019ve now gone through 17 years of failed attempts to impose a U.S. dominated system. There is an Afghan peace movement. It\u2019s not enormous, but it\u2019s significant. It\u2019s been there for several years. We should be doing what we can to support it, to lead them to find a solution internal to Afghanistan, reconciling to the extent possible the conflicting warring factions, there ethnically divided, divided in other terms. It\u2019s an extraordinary problem. The most we can do is to try to facilitate efforts among the Afghans. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much that the United States can hope to do beyond that, and the idea of imposing a military solution looks out of the question."

    "output": "Well, certainly it has not achieved any of its objectives after a huge expenditure. So, give it whatever name you like. I mean, a great power like the United States never really gets defeated. It may not achieve its maximal objectives. So, for example, let\u2019s take Vietnam. It\u2019s almost universally described as a U.S. defeat. But if you look back at the original planning this goes back to the early 50s, for why the United States became involved in Vietnam turns out it wasn\u2019t a complete defeat. The U.S. did not achieve its maximal objectives of turning Vietnam into something like the Philippines, but it did achieve its major objective of preventing an independent South Vietnam from becoming a model that might be followed by others towards a successful independent development. Perhaps eroding the whole Southeast Asia East Asia order, which is what the planners were concerned with in the early 1950s. And that was in fact stopped. Power like the United States is unlikely to face anything like a real defeat, a failure perhaps. JS:I wanted to also make sure to ask you about this ongoing slaughter in Yemen. Recently CNN and some of the other networks have started showing images of U.S. missile parts from munitions that for instance killed an entire bus full of school children recently. Newscaster:This video of shrapnel was filmed in the aftermath of the attack and sent to CNN by a contact and saddle a cameraman working for CNN subsequently filmed these images for us. Munitions experts tell CNN this was a U.S. made Mark MK 82 bomb weighing in at 500 pounds. The first five digits there are the cage number, the commercial and government entity number. This number here denotes Lockheed Martin one of the top U.S. defense contractors."

    "input": "JS:But there was a dearth of that kind of reporting when Obama was waging what started as a secret deniable bombing campaign. He kicked it off in December of 2009 with a cluster bomb attack that killed three dozen women and children in the village of al-Majala in Yemen. And then regularly was hitting Yemen with drone strikes, but it also is often portrayed as kind of Trump supporting the Saudis, when in reality the U.S. first bombed Yemen in November of 2002. This has been going on for a quite a long time. What is the U.S. motivation for this mass slaughter in Yemen right now that is primarily being carried out by Saudi war planes that were given to the Saudis by the United States? And, of course, the U.S. is doing all the intelligence assistance, the refueling and the providing of munitions. But what is the U.S. agenda in Yemen as you can see?",
    "output": "The U.S., and you\u2019re quite right in tracing this back to Obama, in fact, even earlier. The United States wants to ensure that Yemen will be incorporated within the system of reactionary Arab states that the U.S. dominates and largely controls that\u2019s Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, which is a quite a significant military power by the standards of the region and quite vicious and brutal. The Houthi presumably get some degree of Iranian support. To regard that as the Iran as the major threat in the region is ridiculous. The U.S. and secondarily Britain have been arming and developing, supporting the military forces and actions of Saudi Arabia and the UAE with the consequences that you describe. It\u2019s becoming one of the worst humanitarian disasters in the world, the attack on the port, the Hodeida port Newscaster:Coalition forces are closing in and the fighting around the airport has blocked a key exit out of the city making it harder to transport much-needed food aid from Hodeida, the country\u2019s largest port, to the rest of the country. 8.4 million Yemenis are already at risk of starvation. The war has created the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. We can trace this back much farther if you like. So back in the early 1960s, there was a there was a war \u2014 a proxy war \u2014 going on in Yemen between Saudi Arabia and Egypt. At that point, Egypt was the center of secular Arab nationalism under Nasser and regarded as the main enemy by the United States. Saudi Arabia was the center of radical Islam and very much like the British before us, the United States tended systematically to support radical Islamism against secular nationalism. That war was raging right through the 60s. It was a significant war. Israel settled that problem for the United States and Saudi Arabia by smashing secular Arab nationalism in 1967. And that, in fact, is the major turning point in U.S. Israeli relations. Israel performed a great service to the United States and its Saudi Arabian ally and the radical Islamism that centered there by eliminating the secular nationalist alternative. And since then U.S. relations with Israel have been kind of unique, even historically but certainly in the modern world. And this is now another continuation of it with different cast of characters slightly. But Yemen has been regarded as it\u2019s the poorest of Arab states the most miserable in many ways, torn by all sorts of internal conflicts. And the U.S. continues to be committed to trying to ensure that its close allies, the radical Islamist states \u2014 Saudi Arabia, UAE \u2014 maintain control against any adversary. Egypt at that time, Iran, which is a very minor participant in fact, not like Egypt which had a major army there, very minor participant in this case. JS:I\u2019m sure that you paid attention to the reporting around national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s speech at the Federalist Society in which he launched this blistering attack on the international criminal court, the ICC. And, of course, John Bolton has always been against international law and its application to the United States. But Bolton did point something out in that speech that I think is important for people to understand and it\u2019s accurate. Bolton described how in 2002 the U.S. Congress, in a bipartisan fashion, passed legislation that was known in human rights circles as the Hague Invasion Act. John Bolton:This law which enjoyed broad bipartisan support authorizes the president to use all means necessary and appropriate, including force, to shield our service members and the armed forces of our allies from ICC prosecution. It also prohibits several forms of cooperation between the United States and the court. JS:And such radical right-wingers as Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden, and many powerful Democratic senators, they actually voted for that legislation. And yet when Bolton does his attack on the ICC. It was portrayed as \u201cOh, my God, look at how these Trump people are so outside of the norm.\u201d But the reality, isn\u2019t it true, is that this has been the bipartisan power consensus from the very beginning? That no international law should actually apply to the United States and both Republicans and Democrats including the Democrat\u2019s nominee in 2016 believe that the United States would have a right to militarily intervene to prevent a war crimes prosecution of any of its personnel. You\u2019re absolutely correct. In Europe, as you say, it\u2019s called the Netherlands Invasion Act \u2014 authorizes the president to use military force as they put it to rescue any American who might be brought to trial anywhere. So you\u2019re quite correct. It\u2019s unfair to blame this position on Trump and Bolton it goes way back and it goes much farther back than that. So, for example, let\u2019s go back to 1984, the United States in 1984 was, by the World Court, was ordered to terminate what was called unlawful use of force, which means international terrorism against the state of Nicaragua and to pay very substantial reparations. Newscaster:Docking the world court on the questioned drew barbs too on the house floor. House:Mr. Speaker many of us have known for some time that the Reagan Administration Central America policies couldn\u2019t stand the light of day but now the administration is admitting as much by refusing to accept the jurisdiction of the international court of justice over the CIA\u2019s mining of Nicaraguan ports, the Administration has demonstrated that it knows that its policies can\u2019t withstand an inquiry by an impartial objective international body. The U.S. rejected the authorization of the world court and did so with the strong support of liberal America. So, the New York Times, for example, had an editorial condemning the court as what it called a hostel forum and therefore illegitimate. It was a hostile forum because it condemned the United States. Three years earlier, the New York Times had lauded the World Court as a marvelous forum because it supported the United States in a claim against Iran, but now it was a hostile forum and therefore illegitimate. So, the U.S. had no need to pay any attention to its orders. In fact, the U.S. even went so far as to veto a Security Council resolution basically calling on states to observe international law \u2014 didn\u2019t mention the United States but was obvious with the intent was. All of this with the support of liberal opinion across the board. Now at that time, the United States was not alone in defying the World Court. I think, Libya and Albania had also rejected World Court decisions, but they later accepted them. So, the United States is far as I\u2019m aware, is now in splendid isolation and having rejected decision to the world court that\u2019s entirely consistent with the 2002 legislation authorizing the executive to use military force to block any act against Americans by the International Criminal Court, if that\u2019s even conceivable. JS:Well just parenthetically and I don\u2019t want to get into this but I do think it\u2019s worth just mentioning it: that when victims of the U.S. torture program \u2014 the so-called extraordinary rendition program, or people that were taken to Guantanamo or to black sites \u2014 filed lawsuits in the United States against Donald Rumsfeld, President George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, or other officials for the torture that they endured, or the kidnapping that they endured, the justice department intervened in those cases using something called the Westfall Act, which actually has to do with U.S. labor law, and even Attorney General Eric Holder under Obama filed briefs in these lawsuits against Bush-era accused war criminals saying that even if they had committed genocide, that it was within the official scope of their duties. And therefore, they were removed as defendants in those cases and replaced by the U.S. government which has sovereign immunity and, therefore they were dismissed. So, it\u2019s not just on a level of international war or conflict. It\u2019s also on an individual level with U.S. officials, the position of the justice department, including under Obama was that even if Donald Rumsfeld was involved with genocide, it would have been within the official scope of his duties and therefore he cannot be held individually responsible for it. Yeah, that\u2019s a kind of a counterpart to the fact that the U.S. did add a reservation to the genocide convention when it signed it, finally, saying we\u2019re immune. Incidentally, on the torture program, there\u2019s more to be said. There\u2019s good studies of this by Alfred McCoy \u2014 outstanding historian who did some of the major work, among other things, on the history of torture \u2014 JS:He\u2019s a great friend of this show, and has been on several times. He also was my professor when I was briefly an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin. OK, so I don\u2019t have to laud him to you. Done excellent work. But, on torture, he pointed out that when the United States signed the international torture convention, I think it was 1984 or so, the Senate rewrote the convention to exclude the modes of torture that were carried out by the CIA, and that was then instituted into law under Clinton. So you could argue that much of the torture carried out under the Bush Administration was actually not in violation of U.S. law as McCoy also points out, the significant difference between the Guantanamo/Bagram/Abu Ghraib torture and earlier periods, was that in earlier periods, the U.S. supervised the torture and trained the torturers in Latin America, Southeast Asia, but for this time, the U.S. personnel were actually involved, directly, in the torture instead of supervising it, and training the torturers. So that\u2019s a slight change but from a moral point of view, not a very significant one. JS:I do want to make sure to get your sense of what\u2019s happening right now regarding the United States and Venezuela. Of course, you had Nicolas Maduro supposedly surviving a drone strike. Also, these generals, mutinous generals it appears meeting with the Trump Administration to plot a coup, coordinate? It\u2019s unclear exactly what\u2019s happening, but it does seem as though the United States is trying to, once again, foment either a coup or a removal of Nicolas Maduro, Hugo Chavez\u2019s successor. My sense of this is that the United States would support a coup, but not that it\u2019s really trying to instigate it. After all, in the year 2002, there was a military coup in Venezuela, which briefly overthrew the government eliminated Parliament, Supreme Court, it was reversed by a popular uprising. But during the time of the coup, the United States openly and quite publicly supported the military coup as did the liberal press. There was a time back in the 1960s, 1970s when the U.S. was, in fact, in a position to implement, and strongly support military coups right throughout the continent this traces back to the decision by John F Kennedy in 1962 to change the mission of the Latin American military from what was called \u201chemispheric defense\u201d \u2014 that was a holdover from World War II anachronistic \u2014 from \u201chemispheric defense\u201d to \u201cinternal security.\u201d And in the Latin American context \u201cinternal security\u201d means war by the military and paramilitaries against the civilian population. Now in 1962 the U.S. was in a position to change, to shift, the mission of the Latin American military and, in fact, essentially to prepare what became the first major military coup, 1964 in Brazil, then others, one country after another \u2014 Chile, Uruguay, finally Argentina, the worst of them, strongly supported by Kissinger and Reagan than onto Central America \u2014 but the U.S. just doesn\u2019t have that power anymore. One thing that\u2019s happened in recent years is that Latin America has, to a certain extent, extricated itself from imperial, meaning recently U.S. control, this shows in many ways like largely expelling the IMF which for Latin America is a branch of the Treasury Department, eliminating the formal U.S. military bases. So, the U.S. is doubtless involved and it will continue to support the traditional policies, but not with the degree of power it once had. In the case of Venezuela, if there were to be a military coup, I don\u2019t doubt that the U.S. would support it may be the with some clicking of tongues about how it\u2019s not a nice thing but short of that I think the U.S. Is likely to continue with subversion and sabotage and support for the right-wing elements. On the other hand, it should be pointed out that Venezuela is a major disaster at this point. Partly for external reasons, but considerably for internal reasons. Chomsky Talks About the Impact of Social Media Companies and Explains Why a Life of Resisting and Fighting Is Worth It JS:This year\u2019s 30 years since you and the great late Ed Herman published \u201cManufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media,\u201d and I wanted to get your thoughts on the role that huge social media companies play in our society, given that they are replacing a lot of news organizations, or the way that people \u2014 changing the way people consume information Google, Facebook, Twitter, ttc. There\u2019s a lot of talk about this there\u2019s hearings on Capitol Hill. There\u2019s a lot of pleading with the billionaires to kick certain people off of social media, remove their accounts."

    "output": "Well your words process, and disseminate and absorb are correct. But not produce. The source of information remains the major media, the correspondence on the ground \u2014 who often do excellent and courageous and very valuable work. Facebook and the rest may filter information that they get from those sources and present it in ways which much of the public finds it is easier to digest. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a healthy development, but it is happening. And that means essentially, dividing much of the population of much discussion of this into cocoons, into bubbles, into which they receive the information conducive to their own interests and commitments. If you read a major newspaper say the New York Times you get a certain range of opinion. It\u2019s narrow. It\u2019s basically centrist to far right, but at least it\u2019s a range of opinion. Those who are more addicted to social media tend to turn directly to what supports their own views not to hear other things, that\u2019s not a good thing. Google Facebook and the rest, those are commercial institutions. Their constituency is basically advertisers and they would like to establish the kinds of controls over their consumers that will be beneficial to their business model that enabled them to get advertising. That has very serious distorting effects. And we know that they provide massive information to the corporate system, which they use in their own efforts to try to shape and control behavior and opinion. All of this is a dangerous development that the power of these private corporations to direct people, in particular, directions and so on, that\u2019s a serious problem which requires considerable thought and attention. JS:In all of the decades of debating these issues, and campaigning for human rights, and against U.S. wars: Have things changed? And is it worth it to spend a lifetime doing what you\u2019ve done? For young people that are listening. I think if we look over the years, we can see that there have been considerable achievements in changing public attitudes with regard to aggression, human rights, civil rights, and so on. I don\u2019t take credit for that \u2014 plenty of people are involved, plenty of activists, many of them young but the changes are very significant. Let\u2019s go back to the 1960s. In the 1960s the Kennedy escalated the war in 1961 and 62. Now that\u2019s when Kennedy authorized the U.S. Air Force to begin directly bombing rural South Vietnam, authorized Napalm, chemical warfare to destroy crops and livestock, organized mass programs to drive much of the peasantry into what amounted to concentration camps, strategic hamlets, huge escalation. What was the public reaction? Zero. I, at the time, if I wanted to give a talk about it, I\u2019d talk in somebody\u2019s living room, or something like that. That was no protest. In fact, for years, it was difficult, or even impossible, to have public meetings. In Boston, which is a liberal city, public meetings were violently broken up with the support of the press, churches were attacked, and so on. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until about 1967 that a large-scale opposition to the war developed, and by that time South Vietnam had been practically destroyed and the war had expanded the rest of Indochina. Well, finally there was a public reaction. [Protest chants.] In, 198, the Reagan Administration came in and attempted to duplicate what Kennedy had done in the early 60s. Almost step by step. They intended to essentially invade Central America, white paper, blaming the international communists, huge propaganda campaign, and so on. It was almost instantly aborted by popular opposition. There was such massive popular opposition from popular groups, from the churches, and others, that they had to back off. What happened was awful enough, but it wasn\u2019t Vietnam. They had to turn to bringing in other states like Taiwan, Israel, the Argentine neo-Nazis to try to carry out the atrocities. U.S. couldn\u2019t do it directly. That\u2019s very significant. Let\u2019s go on to 2003 when the U.S. invaded Iraq. The worst crime of this century. That\u2019s the first war in the history of imperialism in which the war was massively protested before it was officially launched. That\u2019s never happened before. Protest chants:No war! No war! Now, it\u2019s commonly said that the opposition failed, but I don\u2019t agree. That restricted the kinds of military actions that the U.S. was able to carry out. Again horrible enough, but nothing like Vietnam. Well, all of these are indications of \u2014 and there are many others \u2014 of shifts of popular attitudes towards aggression, intervention, human rights violations, and so on, which make a difference. They haven\u2019t gone far enough, but there\u2019s a considerable improvement. JS:Well, Noam Chomsky. Thank you very much for being so generous with your time. We really appreciate you being with us on Intercepted. Good. Glad to be with you. JS:Noam Chomsky is one of the leading dissidents in the United States.

If we allow ourselves to do so, we should have little difficulty in finding the characteristics of failed states right at home.\u201d What does the current coronavirus pandemic reveal about characteristics of the US as a failed state?",
    "output": "First of all, I perhaps should say that 15 years ago, as you may remember, I wrote a book calledFailed States. It was mostly about the United States, a country that is a danger to itself, to its own citizens, to the world, violates international law, fails to develop internal systems that sustain its own people, and much else. It\u2019s much more extreme now. By now I think it\u2019s a widely held opinion about the US, abroad and at home. I just happen to have read a Canadian newspaper this morning,The National Observer. One of the main articles in it is \u201cHave the Americans Gone Insane?\u201d and describes the craziness in this country. There\u2019s a recent article by George Packer, kind of a mainstream liberal intellectual, called \u201cWe Are Living in a Failed State.\u201d Now, take a look at the coronavirus. Countries have responded to it in different ways.[dog barking]Sorry. DB:Is that how they responded? By barking?[laughter] One way. One of the pleasures of isolation, you get a little company. Right now there is an epidemic of China-bashing, mostly an effort to try to cover up Trump\u2019s crimes against the American people, to find some scapegoat. The facts of the matter are that by January 12, a few days after the first discovery that something was going on, Chinese scientists had identified the virus, sequenced the genome, and given the information to the World Health Organization and to the entire world. So by January 12 every relevant scientist all over the world knew what was happening and what to do about it. And then after that, countries varied. The countries of Asia and Oceania\u2014Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, South Korea\u2014reacted quite quickly and very effectively. They have it pretty much under control by now, close to eradication in some places. Europe didn\u2019t pay a lot of attention to these Asians at first, but most countries gradually got their act together more or less in varying ways, some pretty well, some not. Way at the bottom of the barrel is the US. US intelligence was battering at the doors of the White House, issuing daily reports trying to get somebody\u2019s attention. The top health officials were trying to do the same. Trump wouldn\u2019t listen. He has surrounded himself with a bunch of sycophants who, if they understand anything, wouldn\u2019t dare to say anything to the lord. He apparently, from all reports, has two interests: one is his TV ratings, the other is the stock market. The stock market doesn\u2019t have much to do with the economy, but in his fantasy world it tells him whether he\u2019s going to be elected in November. Why do we have to have these big financial institutions, lending institutions, banks? What do they do to the economy? Mostly harm it. So break them up. So finally in March the stock market tanked. He noticed and he made some statements. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Americans had already died, the pandemic was raging, it was totally out of control. After that comes a series of\u2014if it weren\u2019t so tragic, you would call them comedy acts. One day it\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s like a bad cold, I\u2019ve got it totally under control; the next day it\u2019s a pandemic and I was the first person to notice it, even before anyone else did; the next day a lockdown; the next day open up by Easter. On and on. But there is one theme that runs through: I\u2019ve got to make sure that I\u2019m on top. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens to anyone else. If the scientist in charge of vaccines happens to say something criticizing some of my quack medicine proposals, I\u2019ll fire him. He\u2019s fired. So we lost the head of vaccines. If during my anti-China tirades a major operation working with Chinese scientists is discovering new coronaviruses and working on ways of protecting against them but it happens to have some contact with Chinese scientists who have all the information and so on, destroy the program. That\u2019s the way we are. If it turns out to be convenient to denounce the World Health Organization and I\u2019ll make some points with parts of my voting base who don\u2019t like international institutions and hate foreigners, okay, we\u2019ll defund the World Health Organization and plan to destroy it. Of course, there are consequences, which, interestingly, don\u2019t get discussed. So, say, take Yemen, the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, for which Trump has his share of responsibility, also his predecessor. The worst humanitarian crisis. There are health workers saving people there from the World Health Organization. So let\u2019s get them out and destroy it. Africa is suffering from many diseases. The World Health Organization is on the front line saving people. But who cares? I could get some points with my voting base, so let\u2019s kill a lot of Africans. That\u2019s typical. In fact, if you want to get kind of an encapsulated view of the thinking in the administration, Trump and the people around him, probably the best place to look for a brief picture is his budget proposal for next year. It came out on February 10, right in the middle of the pandemic, though he was still calling it a cold. So what\u2019s in the budget? Well, there is a decrease in funding in some areas, an increase in funding in others. Let\u2019s take a look. What about health areas? The Center for Disease Control, defunded. Actually, Trump has been systematically defunding it every year since he\u2019s been in office, and in the midst of the pandemic let\u2019s defund it further. In fact, anything health-related or anything that\u2019s in service to the population let\u2019s defund. What about increases in funding? Increased subsidies to the fossil fuel industries, that are hard at work trying to ensure that human organized society won\u2019t exist in another couple generations. So fund them. It\u2019s great for profits. It\u2019s my constituency\u2014wealth and corporate power. So fund them, whatever the consequences are; defund others that just serve people and save lives. That\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with. That\u2019s the malignancy that happens to be running the country and the political sector."

    "output": "Never. There\u2019s never been anything remotely like it. There wasn\u2019t much interest in science for a long time, but what there was was taking it seriously. This is off the spectrum. It\u2019s not just the US. The great writer Ariel Dorfman recently in one column quoted a fascist general under Franco back in 1936. He said, \u201cDown with intelligence, forward with death.\u201d That\u2019s Trump and the guys around him: Down with intelligence, forward with death. Not him alone. His favorite friend in South America, Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, is exactly the same. There are others around the world. His favorite dictator, al-Sisi, in Egypt; MBS, the killer leader of Saudi Arabia; Modi in India is another. In the US, of course, it\u2019s far more important because of US power. If you want to look at the thinking of the administration on this topic, incidentally, they\u2019ve been defunding science all the way through the Trump administration. There are laments about it by scientists, science reporters, and others. Some of it is grotesque, like the Environmental Protection Agency, which is now a subsidiary of the coal lobby. The scientists are almost totally gone or they\u2019re silenced. Let\u2019s take a look at the last person that Trump awarded a Medal of Freedom to, Rush Limbaugh, one of the chief sources of information for Republicans and one of the people Trump is listening to all the time. So what does he say? He says there are four corners of deceit: media, government, academia, and science. They exist on the basis of deceit, they\u2019re committed to deceit. So throw them out. Down with intelligence, forward with death. That\u2019s the slogan. And we should remember\u2014I can remember it personally, I\u2019m old enough\u2014in the early and mid-1930s there was a deep global depression. Maybe we\u2019re moving in that direction, but it was much worse than anything that exists today. And there were a number of ways out. Some countries took one way, other countries took a different way. Germany in the 1920s was regarded as one of the best functioning democracies. It was also at the peak of Western civilization in the sciences and the arts and philosophy. They took one way out. The depths of human history, that\u2019s the way they took. The United States took a different way out\u2014one of the most positive, progressive periods of American history. The New Deal has had an enormous effect on American life and is still saving many people, even though there\u2019s been a major effort during the neoliberal period, post-Reagan period, to try to dismantle its achievements. Still, a major positive impact on American society. Those are two ways out. We are now also facing two ways out. It\u2019s not exactly the same as the 1930s, but there are resonances and there are forces working in both directions. There\u2019s Trump, the business classes, the Republican Party, which is not a political party anymore, it\u2019s totally dedicated to wealth and corporate power. You can see it in everything that\u2019s happening in front of your eyes and has been for years. That\u2019s one way out. Let\u2019s make a more authoritarian, harsher version of the neoliberal plague that has devastated society for 40 years, except for the very rich and powerful, and has led to a society in which 0.1 percent\u2014not 1 percent, forget that\u20140.1 percent of the population has 20 percent of the wealth and has been making out like bandits since 2008, after they created the recession and now are getting rewarded for it. That\u2019s 0.1 percent. What counts in politics is your constant, day-to-day activist work, the kind of things that change the social conditions, the understanding, the background under which changes can happen. Half the population has negative net worth, liabilities more than assets. Rough estimates are there are about 70 percent who can barely get by from one week to the next, one paycheck to the next. If something goes wrong, they\u2019re in trouble. Their real wages have pretty much stagnated since the 1970s while wealth has concentrated and gone through the stratosphere, CEO salaries have shot through the roof. Or you can take a look at what has happened to the health system. The health system is a scandal to begin with. It\u2019s unique in the developed world: twice the costs of comparable countries and some of the worst outcomes. But it got much worse during the neoliberal period. So, for example, hospitals have to be run on the business model. What\u2019s the business model? No spare capacity. You don\u2019t want to waste resources. So not an extra hospital bed. Who wants that? It doesn\u2019t work very well, even when the system is working. Plenty of us can attest to that. I can too, even at the best hospitals in the world. But if anything goes wrong, tough luck. Other countries, which were also committed to neoliberal monstrosities, didn\u2019t go anywhere near this far. We\u2019re an unusually business-run society. So take, say, Germany, the most successful state capitalist country in the world, very committed to neoliberalism, ordoliberalism, as they call it. Austerity, all the stupid things. But they had spare capacity. They didn\u2019t destroy the hospital system. They had spare beds, spare diagnostic capacity. When the pandemic struck, they finally noticed it, they could get things in order, and it was pretty well controlled, quite a low death rate. Not in the US. Here it\u2019s going out of control, and it\u2019s going to get worse. If you stop the lockdown, put people out in the streets to converge, of course it\u2019s going to get worse. What Trump and the guys around him are obviously hoping is that they can somehow make it look as though the economy is recovering in time for the election. If a lot of people die, to hell with it. First of all, it\u2019s mostly poor people and black people and people without privilege. They\u2019re the ones who suffer worst. So you can start a propaganda line about these people, Ronald Reagan\u2019s welfare queens, the people with 12 children who don\u2019t want to work and come to the welfare office. You know the line. You can blame it on them and say it\u2019s the cities, the centers of rot and immigrants and Puerto Ricans and all those bad people. That\u2019s the propaganda line. If a couple hundred thousand people die, as Bolsonaro put it recently when confronted with the rising deaths in Brazil thanks to his policies, he said, \u201cSo what?\u201d Trump can say, \u201cPeople have to die. So what?\u201d That\u2019s the thinking in this kind of proto-fascist mentality and the social patterns that are developing. I wouldn\u2019t call it fascism. It gives it too much credit to call it fascism. Fascism had an ideology, a horrible one, but at least an ideology. Here it\u2019s nothing but myself, the rich around me, and so on. That\u2019s probably the tactics for the coming election. It will be terrible for the population. It may give a superficial impression of something working, if he can carry it off. Who knows? It depends on whether the population will let him get away with it. DB:We\u2019ve recently passed the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, and we\u2019re in a major eco-crisis today. Dr. Stephen Bezruchka points out that the loss of habitat and deforestation have brought the animal kingdom in much closer contact with humankind, and that has caused a growth in coronaviruses. That\u2019s exactly what happened in China. But it\u2019s quite general. As habitat is destroyed, animals that humans have had no contact with come out of the forests, humans move in. There\u2019s more contact. One of the most serious cases is, as I mentioned, bats. They happen to have massive amounts of coronaviruses. That\u2019s why the very courageous Chinese scientists have been venturing into very dangerous places, deep inside caves and so on, for years\u2014and many died\u2014to try to collect information about the coronaviruses. They found a ton of information. American scientists were working with them for some time, until it was canceled by the killer in the White House. And in general, that\u2019s true. As you expand high-tech agriculture, which is in itself unsustainable, it\u2019s destroying the topsoil\u2014we won\u2019t have topsoil in a couple of generations\u2014if you continue with unsustainable industrial agribusiness, destroying habitat, if you open up\u2014another one of Trump\u2019s crimes\u2014the national parks to fossil fuel companies, it\u2019s kind of a double whammy. One thing is it increases the use of fossil fuels, to which he\u2019s dedicated, his passionate desire to destroy the possibility for human life in the short term. And that\u2019s not an exaggeration, that\u2019s literally true. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. He just doesn\u2019t give a damn. It\u2019s like Bolsonaro. Who cares, so what? When you do that you first of all are intensifying the use of fossil fuels, and you\u2019re also destroying wild habitat. Every one of the problems we\u2019re talking about, and many that we didn\u2019t, have solutions which are within reach. What\u2019s going to happen? More diseases that we don\u2019t know of. Maybe coronavirus, maybe something else. So in many ways we\u2019re acting to destroy not only ourselves but life on Earth. Let\u2019s not forget that the Anthropocene, as we\u2019re now calling it, the period since the Second World War, the geological epoch when humans are having a massive and destructive impact on the global environment, is a period not just of global warming, which is bad enough and escalating, but also destruction of the environment\u2014of habitats, plastics destroying ocean life, uncontrolled trash and sewage, and unsustainable agriculture, industrial meat production, savage and cruel and also opening the door to pandemics. And the incredibly reckless use of antibiotics means that bacteria mutate much more quickly, so now there are bacteria for which there are no remedies. All of these actions during this period, driven by the need for more profit and more power, are causing massive destruction of species. We\u2019re right in the middle of what\u2019s called the Sixth Extinction. The Fifth Extinction was 65 million years ago, when a huge asteroid hit Earth and killed most of life on Earth. We\u2019re doing the same. We\u2019re the Sixth Extinction. Not just humans. Insect populations are rapidly disappearing. In the places where they\u2019ve been measured\u2014it\u2019s pretty hard to measure\u2014a majority of insect species are disappearing. We survive on the basis of insects. So do many other species. It\u2019s just massive destruction. Fortunately, there are ways out. Every one of the problems we\u2019re talking about, and many that we didn\u2019t, have solutions which are within reach. But you\u2019ve got to do something about it. It\u2019s like the coronavirus pandemic. You can know how to deal with it, but that\u2019s no good unless somebody does something with the knowledge that you have. It\u2019s the same with every other one of these crises. The knowledge is there, the understanding is there\u2014not entirely but you can build on it. But somebody has to do it. If you\u2019re in the grips of a particularly savage form of state capitalism, neoliberal capitalism, what\u2019s amazingly called libertarianism in the US, then you\u2019re toast, nothing can be done. Corporations, obviously, aren\u2019t going to do it, business can\u2019t do it. DB:There\u2019s a lot of concern today about the safety of the food chain, particularly when it comes to meat. In the slaughterhouses in Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska and other states there are many infected workers, people who have contracted the coronavirus, and they\u2019re being forced back to work. I\u2019m wondering if this is not a form of germ warfare. It is, and it\u2019s the entire Republican Party. Let\u2019s take Lindsay Graham, who is supposed to be one of the people who resemble human beings. His latest is, there\u2019s now legislation to try to force people back to work. If the boss tells them, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go, even if there is a coronavirus,\u201d and they don\u2019t, they lose their unemployment insurance. Graham says that\u2019s going to be changed \u201cover our dead bodies.\u201d I\u2019ll never permit unemployment insurance to go on if a guy can go back to work. It\u2019s not just the meat packers. There we can understand it on the basis of pure racism. The meat packers are poor, Hispanic, black. So we go back to Bolsonaro. So what? Of course, it\u2019s savage and brutal. We\u2019re also doing exactly the same thing across the border. Mexico wants to keep the factories closed, the maquiladoras. The Trump administration says, You\u2019ve got to open them, even if you die from coronavirus. Our car manufacturers need leather seats. We don\u2019t care whether you die. This is pure savagery. It\u2019s like defunding the World Health Organization, killing unknown numbers of people in Yemen and Africa who depend on the World Health Organization\u2019s services. They don\u2019t care. Remember the fascist general: \u201cDown with intelligence, forward with death.\u201d That\u2019s the White House."

    "output": "I think Juan Gonz\u00e1lez is not talking hot air. That could happen. We have to remember who\u2019s in office and who supports it. The person in office happens to be a psychopathic megalomaniac who is concerned with nothing but himself. I think it\u2019s psychologically impossible for him to say \u201cI lost\u201d in anything. Furthermore, let\u2019s keep in mind something else. I can\u2019t vouch for this, I\u2019m not certain it\u2019s true, but there are credible reports that the state attorneys general, particularly in New York, have a raft of charges, serious ones, that he\u2019s liable to as soon as he loses presidential immunity. If that\u2019s true, it\u2019s something else. But just psychologically I think he\u2019s incapable of doing what every normal president does and saying, \u201cOkay I lost. Good luck for the next guy. I\u2019ll go on with my life.\u201d Everyone, George W. Bush, anyone. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s capable of doing that. He is trying to organize, very definitely, very obviously, a mass of adoring, worshipers loaded with guns, ready to fight for the guy they regard as their savior, who is stabbing them in the back constantly. A lot of unpleasant characters\u2014a lot of white nationalists, racists, xenophobes, many types that the Republican Party has been trying to organize for some time\u2014could be storming the White House just like they\u2019re storming the state capitals, funded by major corporations, just like what\u2019s happening in the state capitals now. A lot of this is astroturf, it\u2019s pretty clear. He also has behind him the centers of power in private wealth and corporate power. He\u2019s their man. They don\u2019t want a possible move to social democratic policies, the kind that most of the public wants. Who knows how far they will go? I may be a soulful corporation up to a point, but not when my huge, monstrous wealth is at stake. So we don\u2019t know. These things could happen. It\u2019s not to be ruled out. DB:Rob Larson has written a book calledBit Tyrants, which you favorably reviewed. He\u2019s very worried about the amount of power that Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple, the big five, are accumulating, and particularly the implications it has for privacy and surveillance concerns. That\u2019s been going on for some time. It\u2019s what Shoshana Zuboff, a sociologist at Harvard, calls \u201csurveillance capitalism.\u201d She wrote a book with that title about it a year or two ago. Even before the pandemic, which is giving vast amounts of information to these major tech corporations and, of course, to the government, there were huge masses of information being collected about everybody. So if you drive a car, the car, just from all the electronic junk that\u2019s around, it\u2019s picking up information about what you\u2019re doing, where you\u2019re going, everything else that\u2019s connected with your driving. That\u2019s going right to your insurance company. We\u2019re getting to the point where you might get a warning saying, \u201cYou went through a red light. You do you that once more and your insurance is going up.\u201d Or they figured out you like Chinese restaurants, and you will get a notice saying there is a Chinese restaurant a half a mile ahead. That sounds not too bad. It is bad. It also leads to control; it ends up, it\u2019s already at the point, where there is experimentation\u2014this actually started in Sweden, it\u2019s coming here now\u2014with implanting chips in workpeople. The inducement is, if you have a chip, you can get a free Coke at the vending machine. But the chip also monitors what you\u2019re doing. That\u2019s already happening in less intrusive ways. So UPS monitors their truck drivers. It can do that through all the electronic junk that they have. If they stop too long at a place to go to the bathroom or something, they will get a demerit; if they back up when they shouldn\u2019t have, they will get a demerit. You get too many, your job is on the line. They claim that they\u2019ve improved efficiency considerably this way\u2014more deliveries, fewer people. Amazon works like that. At the Amazon workplace people are very tightly monitored. You take the wrong path between this spot and that spot, you will get an electronic notice about it. The ideal which we\u2019re moving towards is something like parts of China, where there are cities which operate on what\u2019s called a social credit system. You get, I don\u2019t know, 1,000 points or whatever it is, and you\u2019re under tight monitoring: cameras, facial identification, electronics. If you jaywalk, you lose credits; if you help an old lady across the street, you gain credits. Pretty soon it all gets internalized; you don\u2019t even notice it. It\u2019s like stopping at red lights. It\u2019s just the way the world is. You live under tight, constant monitoring. If you think about it, even having a job is like that. If you go back to the early Industrial Revolution, the idea that you would be a wage worker was considered an incredible assault on human dignity and human freedom. It was called wage slavery: you\u2019re dependent on someone else. In fact, you\u2019re dependent on someone who is a totalitarian of a kind that Stalin never dreamed of. Stalin didn\u2019t tell you when you were allowed to go to the bathroom, who you were allowed to talk to, what clothes you had to wear. That\u2019s your job for most of your waking hours. That was considered an unbelievable assault on dignity by working people in the 19th century. It was a slogan of the Republican Party under Lincoln that wage labor is intolerable unless it\u2019s temporary, until you become a free person again. We\u2019ve internalized that. People think having a job is a wonderful thing, spending most of your waking life in thrall to a totalitarian boss is the best thing you can look forward to. That\u2019s a big change. We\u2019ve internalized it. Not everybody, of course. Human dignity is not that far below the surface. But the idea of surveillance capitalism is to get us to internalize that. It\u2019s going to get worse as you move into what\u2019s called the internet of things. Your refrigerator has some electronic device so if you\u2019re driving home, you can get it to move something out of the freezer or something like that. This stuff is all going to be picking up information about you. Everything you do will be monitored and go back to these big tech companies and the big brother who is collecting it in some huge place in Utah or somewhere for use, if necessary. None of this has to happen. First of all, the big tech companies could be broken up. They could be required to meet the same conditions, say, that newspapers have to meet. If you\u2019re libeled in a newspaper, you can bring a libel suit. If you\u2019re libeled on Facebook, you can\u2019t do a thing. Why should they have that extra privilege? Personally, I don\u2019t believe in libel suits, but if they exist, it should be the same for all of them. If you look something up on Google, you\u2019re immediately given a list of things that maybe you would like this, maybe you would like that. Amazon, all of them. They are efforts to sell you to the business world, and in the course of that to begin to control you and get you to internalize the controls. It\u2019s a very serious problem. Incidentally, these are not the only corporations that should be looked at in terms of breaking them up. What about the fossil fuel corporations? Why should they even exist? Their role in the world is to keep us going for a while but then to ensure our destruction. So why not take them over, work to socialize them, put them under control of the workers, and have them move towards renewable energy. They can do that. A lot of the big fossil fuel corporations, recently Chevron, had a quite profitable, sustainable energy project. They canned it because they can make more profit destroying the environment with fossil fuels. But it doesn\u2019t have to be canned, it doesn\u2019t have to be destroyed. It could be developed, it could be moving towards replacing these destructive substances. Why do we have to have these big financial institutions, lending institutions, banks? What do they do to the economy? Mostly harm it. So break them up. Let\u2019s go back to the days when banks were banks. It\u2019s not too utopian to say let\u2019s go back to the pre-Reagan years. In the pre-Reagan years, no tax havens, no stock buybacks, both illegal, and the Treasury Department enforced it. No financial institutions involved in developing complex financial instruments to rob the public and lead to financial crises. They were banks. You put money into them. If they had extra money, they lent it to somebody who wanted to do something. It\u2019s not utopian to say let\u2019s go back to that, when the Treasury Department really kept things running, no financial crises. They started practically as soon as Reagan came in. Clinton made it much worse with the massive deregulation of the Rubin-Summers variety. Deregulating derivatives was just asking for disaster, which came. Of course, they were bailed out. The way our system works, the perpetrators, the rich and powerful, get bailed out. Not the victims. They don\u2019t get bailed out."

    "output": "First of all, who gains from Social Security? The 0.1 percent? That\u2019s the answer to that. The Post Office is more interesting. The Post Office is a very efficient organization which serves the general public all over the place\u2014in rural communities, in cities. It\u2019s even a friendly place. You get to know your letter carrier. Maybe he helps you out when you\u2019re in trouble sometime. You go into the post office, you talk to the guy, you meet friends there. It\u2019s a social institution which also provides very necessary services. That\u2019s bad in a number of ways. For one thing, it\u2019s helping the wrong people, the majority. For another thing, it\u2019s giving people a bad idea. Something that you own, the Post Office, namely the government if it\u2019s democratic, can work for you. That\u2019s a terrible idea. Remember Reagan reading his lines? The government is a problem. Hand it over to the private sector. We don\u2019t want people to believe that a government institution can do something for them. That\u2019s why, incidentally, the Republican Congress has been trying hard to destroy the Post Office for years. Crazy rules that make it almost impossible for them to function, like prefunding of pensions for decades in advance, not able to charge decent rates, not able to provide services. The Post Office would be the obvious place, as it once was, for people to do banking. People aren\u2019t going to put in $10 million, but the kind of deposits that ordinary people have you can do it at the local post office. You don\u2019t have to deal with the gougers and the usury or anything else. It could be a place where you vote. It could be all sorts of things. But we have to destroy it. And there is something in the background which I\u2019m sure the rich and powerful are thinking about. We\u2019re supposed to revere the founders, the framers of the Constitution, these godlike creatures. And you have the courts, the reactionary courts run by what are called originalists, meaning we\u2019ve got to attend to every word and intention of the famous founders. They had some things to say that the rich and powerful don\u2019t want you to hear, in particular about the Post Office. The Post Office is in the Constitution. What was it supposed to do? It was supposed to provide subsidies to the press to ensure that there would be a free and independent press. The large majority of Post Office business in the early years was journals and newspapers, and at very cheap rates, intended as a public subsidy to help create a free and independent press. You want to get the population to understand that? You want people to notice this is about the only country that doesn\u2019t have public broadcasting? We have a tiny fringe, which is corporate-run, but there\u2019s nothing like the BBC or French television or anything like that. About all there is is at the local level, community radio and TV, often very valuable. There could be a lot more of that if activists would make use of the opportunities. There have been struggles about that all through modern history, but we have to make sure that government does not serve the people. The worst possible thing imaginable is government of, by, and for the people. We have to kill any such idea, make sure that nobody gets that from their experience, nobody thinks about it. And certainly we don\u2019t want a free and independent press. So the Post Office has to go. I don\u2019t know how much Trump understands, probably not very much, but he understands enough to know that the Post Office serves people and not the very rich. They can use other means. DB:And, of course, during a pandemic, with an election coming up, voting by mail becomes something very important. But you\u2019re not allowed to charge reasonable postal rates. It doesn\u2019t matter. Why should Trump or the people around him care about who dies in the pandemic? Do they do anything to indicate that they care? All the opposite, just as we\u2019ve been running through, and we\u2019ve barely touched the surface. So if the Post Office helps people during the pandemic, what\u2019s that got to do with anything?So what, to quote Bolsonaro."

    "input": "DB:Talk about the upcoming election. Say you\u2019re talking to a die-hard Bernie supporter who feels that their candidate was not treated well by the Democratic Party and \u201cI\u2019m going to sit this one out.\u201d What do you say to that person?",
    "output": "I would say three things. First of all, notice that the Sanders campaign has been an astonishing success in many ways. It\u2019s entirely shifted the arena of discussion, policy formation, and policy in too many ways to enumerate. And it hit the DNC. So take a look at the official Democratic Party program, what\u2019s now called Biden\u2019s program. It\u2019s way to the left of anything since FDR. Is it because the DNC suddenly had a conversion? No, it\u2019s because of the pressure they\u2019re getting from activists working, many of them under the Sanders umbrella. That\u2019s one of many achievements. The second thing to look at is, why didn\u2019t Sanders get the nomination? It\u2019s true, the media were against him, the DNC were against him. But that\u2019s not the whole story. You have to look beyond. Take a look at the primaries. Sanders was counting on an upsurge among younger voters, his supporters. Did it happen? No, it didn\u2019t happen. They didn\u2019t come out and vote. That\u2019s something to look at, especially if you\u2019re a Sanders supporter. What else happened? Sanders didn\u2019t win two major constituencies: African Americans and women. If you look at their voting preferences, they preferred his policies but they didn\u2019t vote for him. And when you look at the studies that have been done, it seems the reason is they were saying to themselves, I like his policies but he\u2019s not going to be able to broaden the coalition to bring in so-called moderates, a broader group of people who we\u2019ll be able to tolerate to get rid of Trump, which is the top priority. Is that wrong? We don\u2019t know that that\u2019s wrong. In fact, if you look at the way Sanders fared in the Rust Belt, it may be right. That tells you something that has to be done. For activists who supported Sanders, so that we can reach out, not by abandoning our principles but by showing that they\u2019re the right principles for a much broader constituency and not doing the kinds of things that might alienate them. We\u2019ve got to work on that. So those are lessons. The third point, which is about as complicated as 1+1=2, is that in this election, if it\u2019s going to be Biden or Trump, in other states it doesn\u2019t matter but in a swing state you have two choices: one of them is to vote for Biden, the other is to not vote for Biden. To not vote for Biden takes a vote away from the opposition, which is the same as adding a vote for Trump. So your two choices are vote against Trump or vote for Trump. That\u2019s basically what it comes down to. As I say, that\u2019s about as hard to figure out as 1+1=2. So that\u2019s the choice. Meanwhile, recognize what the left has always understood. Elections are a blip. They\u2019re a brief moment taken away from activism. The standard doctrine which the rich and powerful and the ruling groups want to drill into your head is that politics consists of voting once every four years, then go home and leave it to your betters. In fact, that\u2019s called progressive democratic theory. That\u2019s the official doctrine. Don\u2019t fall for it. The correct doctrine is the left doctrine. What counts in politics is your constant, day-to-day activist work, the kind of things that change the social conditions, the understanding, the background under which changes can happen. Every couple of years an event comes along which would take you maybe 15 minutes to think about. Take a look at the political system. Decide if there is a meaningful choice. If there is, take a couple minutes and go into the voting booth and vote against the worst guy. Because it can make a difference, in fact, a big difference. Then go back to your activist work. Your activist work might be preparing for a campaign, like working in the Sanders campaign, which had a major effect. It can be that. It can be other things. But that\u2019s the way you should look at elections. Until the point when you actually move towards a party that might be committed to being a government that\u2019s of, by, and for the people. That\u2019s actually happened. The Roosevelt administration had plenty of flaws, but it moved very far in that direction. It was a sympathetic administration, had tremendous popular pressure: The labor movement, political parties, activist groups. And it accomplished quite a lot and made a big difference for the years that followed it, including Social Security that you mentioned, and a lot more. So those are the choices for a supporter of Sanders. The worst choice is to say, \u201cI didn\u2019t get what I wanted. I\u2019m going to go home and sulk and let the world go to pot.\u201d That\u2019s the worst choice. That\u2019s giving it to Trump. DB:While there is selfishness there is also tremendous sacrifices that people are making. I\u2019m thinking of the doctors and nurses and EMTs and caregivers who have done extraordinary work. It\u2019s incredible. They\u2019re a real indication of what the human spirit can achieve. And the same is much more broadly true. Around the world\u2014Brazil, here, other countries, often in the poorest communities\u2014people are just getting together in mutual support groups. Let\u2019s get together and help that elderly guy who\u2019s stuck in his house somewhere and doesn\u2019t have any food. Or let\u2019s get together and organize and set up a food bank and so on. People are capable of all sorts of things. There\u2019s also, incidentally, on the international level, one example of a country that\u2019s showing what genuine internationalism is. There\u2019s something called the European Union. There is a rich country, Germany, which has pretty much handled things for itself. A couple of miles to the south there is a country called Italy, which is in trouble. Northern Italy has a serious pandemic. Is Germany helping them? No. But some country is. It\u2019s called Cuba, the country that we\u2019ve had under our boot for 60 years, trying to crush it. They are now sending doctors all over the world to the front lines to compensate for what the rich and powerful aren\u2019t doing. It\u2019s not new. It\u2019s been happening for a long time. But we\u2019re not allowed to notice that. That\u2019s the wrong message, like noticing that the Post Office works. But we could learn something from them."

    "instruction": "Respond as a political activist in a Radio Show discussing Ukraine",
    "input": "JS:I want to start because there\u2019s been a lot of discussion on the left in the United States among anti-war activists on how to make sense of what a just response would look like to Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine and the mass killing that we are seeing. We can take time to talk about the broader historical context, and you\u2019ve been discussing this a lot in other interviews, but I want to just start by asking you, is there any aspect of the U.S., NATO, and European Union response to this invasion that you believe is just: the weapons transfers to Ukraine, the sweeping economic sanctions and attempts to entirely isolate not only Russia and Putin, but ordinary Russians? Is there any aspect of the government response to this by the U.S., NATO or the European Union that you agree with?",
    "output": "I think that support for Ukraine\u2019s effort to defend itself is legitimate. If it is, of course, it has to be carefully scaled, so that it actually improves their situation and doesn\u2019t escalate the conflict, to lead to destruction of Ukraine and possibly beyond sanctions against the aggressor, or appropriate just as sanctions against Washington would have been appropriate when it invaded Iraq, or Afghanistan, or many other cases. Of course, that\u2019s unthinkable given U.S. power and, in fact, the first few times it has been done \u2014 the one time it has been done \u2014 the U.S. simply shrugged its shoulders and escalated the conflict. That was in Nicaragua ,when the U.S. was brought to the World Court, condemned for unlawful use of force or to pay reparations, responded by escalating the conflict. So it\u2019s unthinkable in the case of the U.S., but it would be appropriate. However, I still think it\u2019s not quite the right question. The right question is: What is the best thing to do to save Ukraine from a grim fate, from further destruction? And that\u2019s to move towards a negotiated settlement. There are some simple facts that aren\u2019t really controversial. There are two ways for a war to end: One way is for one side or the other to be basically destroyed. And the Russians are not going to be destroyed. So that means one way is for Ukraine to be destroyed. The other way is some negotiated settlement. If there\u2019s a third way, no one\u2019s ever figured it out. So what we should be doing is devoting all the things you mentioned, if properly shaped, but primarily moving towards a possible negotiated settlement that will save Ukrainians from further disaster. That should be the prime focus. That requires that we can\u2019t look into the minds of Vladimir Putin and the small clique around him; we can speculate, but can\u2019t do much about it. We can, however, look at the United States and we can see that our explicit policy \u2014 explicit \u2014 is rejection of any form of negotiations. The explicit policy goes way back, but it was given a definitive form in September 2021 in the September 1 joint policy statement that was then reiterated and expanded in the November 10 charter of agreement. And if you look at what it says, it basically says no negotiations. What it says is it calls for Ukraine to move towards what they called an enhanced program for entering NATO, which kills negotiations; \u2014 this is before the invasion notice \u2014 an increase in the dispatch of advanced weapons to Ukraine, more military training, the joint military exercises, weapons placed on the border. We can\u2019t be sure, but it\u2019s possible that these strong statements may have been a factor in leading Putin and his circle to move from warning to direct invasion. We don\u2019t know. But as long as that policy is guiding the United States, it\u2019s basically saying, to quote Ambassador Chas Freeman, it\u2019s saying: Let\u2019s fight to the last Ukrainian. [That\u2019s] basically, what it amounts to. So the questions you raised are important, interesting, just what is the appropriate kind of military aid to give Ukrainians defending themselves enough to defend themselves, but not to lead to an escalation that will just simply lead to massive destruction? And what kinds of sanctions or other actions could be effective in deterring the aggressors? Those are all important, but they pale into insignificance in comparison with the primary need to move towards a negotiated settlement, which is the only alternative to destruction of Ukraine, which of course, Russia is capable of carrying out. JS:You know, it\u2019s interesting because Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been really lionized, particularly in the U.S. and Western European media. And he\u2019s become a kind of caricature, with these grand, sweeping historical comparisons. And often the quotes from him are intended to give the appearance of this defiant leader who is going to fight to the end. But when you read between the lines, and you read what Ukrainian negotiators are saying, when you read what Zelenskyy says when pressed on conditions for peace, he seems to be extremely aware of the factors that you\u2019re citing, that this has to end in a negotiation. And I want to ask you about the role of the U.S. and European media in perpetuating this mythology around Zelenskyy, and the way in which it seems to kind of undermine the seriousness of the negotiators of Ukraine or of Zelenskyy when he is talking in a nuanced manner. It seems that there\u2019s this intent to kind of create a caricature rather than actually listening to the conditions that Ukraine is stating it can live with. Yes, you\u2019re absolutely right. If you look at the media coverage, Zelenskyy\u2019s very clear, explicit, serious statements about what could be a political settlement \u2014 crucially, neutralization of Ukraine \u2014 those have been literally suppressed for a long period, then sidelined in favor of heroic, Winston Churchill impersonations by Congressman, others casting Zelenskyy in that mold. So, yes, of course. He\u2019s made it pretty clear that he cares about whether Ukraine survives, whether Ukrainians survive, and has therefore put forth a series of reasonable proposals that could well be the basis for negotiation. We should bear in mind that the nature of a political settlement, the general nature of it, has been pretty clear on all sides for quite some time. In fact, if the U.S. had been willing to consider them, there might not have been an invasion at all. Before the invasion, the U.S. basically had two choices: One was to pursue its official stance, which I just reviewed, which makes the negotiations impossible and may have led to war; the other possibility was to pursue the options that were available. To an extent, they\u2019re still somewhat available, attenuated by the war, but the basic terms are pretty clear. Sergey Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister announced at the beginning of the invasion that Russia had two main goals \u2014 two main goals. Neutralization of Ukraine and demilitarization. Demilitarization doesn\u2019t mean getting rid of all your arms. It means getting rid of heavy weapons connected to the interaction with NATO aimed at Russia. What his terms meant basically was to turn Ukraine into something like Mexico. So Mexico is a sovereign state that can choose its own way in the world, no limitations, but it can\u2019t join a Chinese-run military alliances in placing advanced weapons, Chinese weapons, on the U.S. border, carrying out joint military operations with the People\u2019s Liberation Army, getting training and advanced weapons from Chinese instructors and so on. In fact, that\u2019s so inconceivable that nobody even dares to talk about it. I mean, if any hint of anything like that happened, we know what the next step would be \u2014 no need to talk about it. So it\u2019s just inconceivable. And basically, Lavrov\u2019s proposals could plausibly be interpreted as saying: Let\u2019s turn Ukraine into Mexico. Well, that was an option that could have been pursued. Instead, the U.S. preferred to do what I just described as inconceivable for Mexico. Now, that\u2019s not the whole story. There are other issues. One issue is Crimea. The fact of the matter is Crimea is off the table. We may not like it. Crimeans apparently do like it. But the U.S. says: We\u2019re never going to concede it. Well, that is the basis for permanent conflict. Zelenskyy has sensibly said: Let\u2019s put that off for further discussion. That makes sense. Another issue is the Donbas region. That\u2019s been a region of extreme violence for eight years on both sides: Ukrainian shelling, Russian shelling, land mines all over the place, lots of violence. There are OSCE observers, European observers on the ground who give regular reports. You can read them, they\u2019re public. They don\u2019t try to assess the source of the violence \u2014 that\u2019s not their mission \u2014 but they talk about its radical increase. According to them, if my memory is correct, about 15,000 people or something in that neighborhood may have been killed in the conflict over the last eight years since the Maidan Uprising. Well, something has to be done about Donbas, the proper reaction, which maybe the Russians would accept, would be a referendum, an internationally supervised referendum to see what the people of the region want. One possibility, which was available before the invasion, was implementation of the Minsk II agreements, which provided for some form of autonomy in the region within a broader Ukrainian Federation, something like maybe Switzerland or Belgium or other places where there are federal structures \u2014 conflict, but confined within federal structures. That would have been a possibility. Whether it could have worked, there\u2019s only one way to find out: to try. The U.S. refused to try; instead, insisted on a super-militant position, official position, which, as far as I know, the press has yet to report. You can tell me if I\u2019m wrong, but I have never seen one reference anywhere in the mainstream press. Occasionally, we at the margins; any reference to the official U.S. position of September 1, 2021, the reiteration or expansion of it in November in the charter. Actually I saw one reference to it in the American Conservative, conservative journal, which did refer to it. And, of course, on the left people have talked about it. But the U.S. insisted on that position, which the alternative would have been to pursue the opposite, the option of saying: OK, your main goals are neutralization and demilitarization, meaning Mexico-style arrangement, let\u2019s pursue that. With regard to Crimea, let\u2019s accept Zelenskyy\u2019s sensible position that let\u2019s delay it, we can\u2019t deal with it now. With regard to the Donbas region, work towards some kind of framework with autonomy, based on the opinions of the people who live there, which can be determined by an internationally supervised referendum. Would the Russians agree? We don\u2019t know. Would the United States agree? We don\u2019t know. All we know is they\u2019re rejecting it, officially. Could they be pressed to accept it? I don\u2019t know. We can try. That\u2019s the one thing we can hope to do. I mean, there is a sort of a guiding principle that we should be keeping in mind, no matter what the issue, the most important question is: What can we do about it? Not: What can somebody else do about it? That\u2019s worth talking about. But from the most elementary point of view, the major question is, what can we do about it? And we can, in principle, at least do a lot about U.S. policy, less about other things. So I think that\u2019s where the focus of our attention and energy should be. JS:I want to ask you about some of the statements that Biden administration officials have made in recent days. On the Sunday talk shows this past weekend, you had the national security adviser and the Secretary of State both laying out what was almost an overt war plan for seeking to fundamentally weaken the Russian state and talking about the war in Ukraine as helping to achieve a goal of a severely weakened Russia. To what extent are U.S. actions that we\u2019re witnessing now in Ukraine, ultimately aimed at bringing down the government, in Moscow, of Vladimir Putin? Yes, there was the kerfuffle over Biden talking about the this-guy\u2019s-got-to-go quote. But the actions are playing out in full public view. And I think a lot of people put too much weight on a particular clip of Joe Biden, though he may have intentionally said it that way. It\u2019s hard to tell right now with him whether he means to say something or not. But setting that aside, it does seem that a major aspect of the U.S. position right now is that this is a grand opportunity to \u2014 they smell the blood of Putin in the water, I guess, is what I\u2019m saying now. Yes, I think the actions indicate that. But remember, there\u2019s something along with action \u2014 namely inaction. What is the United States not doing? Well, what it\u2019s not doing is rescinding the policies that I described, maybe the American press doesn\u2019t let Americans know about them, but you can be sure that Russian intelligence reads what is on the official White House website, obviously. So maybe Americans can be kept in the dark, but the Russians read and know about it. And they know that one form of inaction is not to change that. The other form of inaction is not to move to participate in negotiations. Now, there are two countries that could, because of their power, facilitate a diplomatic settlement \u2014 I don\u2019t say bring about, but facilitate, make it more likely. One of them is China; the other is the United States. China is being rightly criticized for a refusal to take this step; criticism of the United States is not allowed, so the United States is not being criticized for its failure to take this step and, furthermore, its actions, which makes this step more remote, like the statements you quote on the Sunday talk shows. Just imagine how they reach Putin and his circle, what they\u2019re saying, what they interpret as meaning is: Nothing you can do. Go ahead and destroy Ukraine as much as you like. There\u2019s nothing you can do, because you\u2019re going to be out. We\u2019re going to ensure that you have no future. So therefore, you might as well go for broke. That\u2019s what the heroic pronouncements on the Sunday talk show mean. It may feel like, again, Winston Churchill impersonations, very exciting. But what they translate into is: Destroy Ukraine. That\u2019s the translation. Inaction, in refusal to withdraw the policy positions that the Russians certainly are fully aware of, even if Americans are kept in the dark, one is to withdraw those. Second is: Do what we blame China for not doing. Join in efforts to facilitate a diplomatic settlement and stop telling the Russians: There\u2019s no way out; you might as well go for broke; your backs are against the wall. Those are things that could be done. JS:Now, I want to ask you about media coverage. And first, I just want to say that we have already seen a horrifying number of journalists killed in Ukraine. In fact, a friend of mine, the filmmaker Brent Renaud, was one of the first journalists killed in Ukraine. And it\u2019s horrifying to witness media workers, some of whom appear to have been directly targeted for killing. So I guess I just want to say at the onset that I think we\u2019re seeing some incredibly brave and vital journalism coming out of Ukraine, and much of it is being done by Ukrainian reporters. And that statement just needs to stand on its own. But back in the studios in Washington, and Berlin, and London, there\u2019s a different form of media activism happening. And it really seems as though many journalists see their role now working for powerful, particularly broadcast media outlets, as supporting the position of the United States and NATO and being actual propagandists for a particular outcome and course of action. And this is happening at the same time that the Biden administration is now admitting that it has been manipulating the media by putting out unverified intelligence and pushing claims about plans to use chemical weapons and other actions. And I just want to read to you, Noam, from an NBC News report recently, it said: \u201cIt was an attention-grabbing assertion that made headlines around the world. U.S. officials said they had indications suggesting Russia might be preparing to use chemical agents in Ukraine. President Joe Biden later said it publicly. But three U.S. officials told NBC News this week there is no evidence Russia has brought any chemical weapons near Ukraine. They said the U.S. released the information to deter Russia from using the banned munitions [...] Multiple U.S. officials acknowledged that the U.S. has used information as a weapon even when confidence in the accuracy of the information wasn\u2019t high. Sometimes it has used low-confidence intelligence for deterrent effect, as with chemical agents, and at other times, as an official put it, the U.S. is just \u2018trying to get inside Putin\u2019s head.\u2019\u201d Now this kind of activity from the U.S. government is not new. What I think is extraordinary or interesting is that they\u2019re now not only owning it publicly, but they are almost celebrating that they\u2019re able to use their own news media and powerful journalists to spread it as part of their war effort. As you say, it\u2019s by no means new. You can trace it far back in a concentrated, organized form back to World War I, when the British established a Ministry of Information. We know what that means. The goal of the Ministry of Information was to put up horror stories about German war crimes which would induce Americans to get into the war, Woodrow Wilson \u2014 and it worked. If you read U.S. liberal intellectuals, they were taken. They accepted it. They said: Yes, we have to stop these horrible crimes that the British Ministry of Information is concocting in order to mislead us. President Wilson set up his own ministry of public information, meaning lies to the public, to try to encourage Americans to hate everything German. So the Boston Symphony Orchestra wouldn\u2019t play Beethoven, for example. Then it goes on. Reagan had what\u2019s called an Office of Public Diplomacy, meaning an office to lie to the public and the media about what we\u2019re doing. But it\u2019s not a hard task for the government. And the reason was actually stated, rather clearly, by the public relations officer of the United Fruit Company, back in 1954, when the U.S. was moving to overthrow the democratic government of Guatemala and install a vicious, brutal dictatorship, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people with U.S. support ever since. He was asked by the media: What about the United Fruit Company efforts to try to convince journalists to support this? He said: Yes, we did it. But you have to remember how eager they were for the experience. OK? Wasn\u2019t hard. They wanted it. We fed them these lies. They were delighted because they wanted to support the state and its violence and terror. Now, that\u2019s not the journalists on the ground. There is a split, as you describe. It\u2019s true of every war. So in Nicaragua, in the Central American wars of the 1980s, there were great reporters on the ground. The Vietnam War, same thing, doing serious, courageous work \u2014 many suffering for it. You get up to the newsrooms; it looks totally different. That\u2019s a fact about the media."

    "input": "And we don\u2019t have to look far back. You can take a look at The New York Times. It\u2019s the best newspaper in the world, which is not a high bar. Its main thinker, a big thinker, who writes serious articles, had an article, an op-ed a day or two ago, saying: How can we deal with war criminals? What can we do? We\u2019re stuck. There\u2019s this war criminal running Russia. How can we possibly deal with him?",
    "output": "The interesting thing about that article is not so much that it appeared. You expect that kind of stuff. It\u2019s that it didn\u2019t elicit ridicule. In fact, there was no comment on it. We don\u2019t know how to deal with war criminals? Sure, we do. In fact, we had a clear exhibition of it just a couple of days ago. One of the leading war criminals in the United States is the man who ordered the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq; can\u2019t go far beyond that as being a war criminal. And, in fact, on the 20th anniversary of the invasion of Afghanistan, there was one interview in the press. To its credit, The Washington Post did interview him in the Style section. The interview is worth reading: It\u2019s about this lovable, goofy grandpa playing with his grandchildren; happy family, showing off the portraits he painted of great people he had met. So we know how to deal with war criminals. What\u2019s the problem? We deal with them very easily. Nevertheless, this column could appear in the world\u2019s greatest newspaper, which is interesting enough, and not elicit a word of comment, which is much more interesting. Well, that tells you what you\u2019re talking about, as Tom McCann said, the United Fruit Company PR guy: They\u2019re eager for the experience. It doesn\u2019t take much propaganda. So the government can work hard with its cognitive control systems. But it\u2019s pushing an open door at the editorial level. And this has been true as far back as you want to go, and it still is. JS:Charlie Savage, who is not an op-ed writer, but is an excellent national security reporter for The New York Times, also had a piece that dealt with some of this this week in The New York Times. And it was an analytical piece, looking at the challenge that the U.S. has made for itself because of its grand hypocrisy on issues of international criminal court. And I just want to summarize a little bit for people that maybe don\u2019t follow this the way that you do or I do. But the short of it is that the United States has consistently been adamantly and militantly opposed to any international judicial body that would have jurisdiction over its own actions. And in fact, in 2002, George W. Bush signed into law a bipartisan piece of legislation that came to be known as the Hague Invasion Act. And people can go online and read the bill themselves, and it\u2019s still the law of the land in the United States, but one of the clauses of that law states that the U.S. military can be authorized to literally conduct a military operation in the Netherlands to liberate any U.S. personnel who are brought there on war crimes charges or under war crimes investigation. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called, by many activists and civil libertarians, the Hague Invasion Act. At the same time, Joe Biden himself has said Vladimir Putin is a war criminal, and has called for a war crimes trial while the United States itself has only supported these ad hoc tribunals for countries like Yugoslavia, or Rwanda, and, like Russia, the United States refuses to ratify the treaty that established the International Criminal Court."

    "input": "I\u2019m sure, Noam, that you and I both agree that there are massive war crimes being conducted right now in Ukraine \u2014 certainly Russia is the dominant military power and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised for one second if a huge percentage of the war crimes being committed are being done by Russia. That doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t war crimes being committed by Ukraine. We already have video evidence of this, of both Ukraine and Russia. But I want to be clear here; I believe that Russia is committing systemic war crimes in Ukraine. But when you have the United States undermining the International Criminal Court, refusing to ratify the treaty, how can Joe Biden call for a war crimes trial, when Dick Cheney and George Bush are walking around as free men, not to mention Henry Kissinger? And when the U.S. itself won\u2019t accept that that court should have jurisdiction equally over all powers in the world?",
    "output": "Well, two questions, points of fact: You\u2019re quite right, that the overwhelming mass of the war crimes, the ones that we should be considering, are carried out by the Russians. That\u2019s not in dispute. And they are major war crimes. It\u2019s also true that the United States totally blocked the ICC. But notice there\u2019s nothing new about that. There\u2019s even a stronger case, which has been deep-sixed. The United States is the only country to have rejected a judgment of the International Criminal Court \u2014 of the World Court. They used to have two companions, Hoxha of Albania and Qaddafi in Libya. But they are gone. So now the U.S. stands in splendid isolation in having rejected the judgment of the World Court, that was in 1986, dealt with one of Washington\u2019s minor crimes, the war against Nicaragua. The court condemned the United States for \u2014 the words were \u2014 \u201cunlawful use of force,\u201d meaning international terrorism, ordered the U.S. to desist and pay substantial reparations. Well, there was a reaction by the Reagan administration and Congress: Escalate the crimes. That was the reaction. There was a reaction in the press: The New York Times editorial saying the court decision is irrelevant, because the court is a hostile forum. Why is it a hostile forum? Because it dares to accuse the United States of crimes. So that takes care of that. So the reaction is to escalate the crimes. Nicaragua actually sponsored first a Security Council resolution, which didn\u2019t mention the United States, just called on all states to observe international law; the U.S. vetoed it. It was on record as saying to the Security Council, states should not observe international law. It then went to the General Assembly who overwhelmingly approved a similar resolution. U.S. opposed, Israel opposed, two states that should not observe international law. Well, all of that, that\u2019s not part of history as far as the United States is concerned. That\u2019s the kind of history, according to Republicans, you shouldn\u2019t teach because it\u2019s divisive, makes people feel bad. You shouldn\u2019t teach it. But you don\u2019t have to tell anyone because it\u2019s not taught. And it\u2019s not remembered \u2014 virtually no one remembers it. And it goes beyond that. The United States, in fact, when the major treaties, like the Organization of American States treaty, were signed back in the 40s, the United States added reservations, saying basically not applicable to the United States. In fact, the United States very rarely signs any conventions \u2014 very rarely. I mean ratifies \u2014 sometimes it signs. And when it does ratify them, they are with reservations, excluding the United States. That even includes the Genocide Convention. There is a Genocide Convention. The United States finally ratified it after, I think, about 40 years, but with a reservation saying inapplicable to the United States. We are entitled to commit genocide. That came to the international tribunals: Yugoslavia tribunal, or maybe it was the World Court. I don\u2019t remember. Yugoslavia charged NATO with crimes in its attack on Serbia. The NATO powers agreed to enter into the details of the court operations. The U.S. refused. And it did on grounds that Yugoslavia had mentioned genocide. And the United States is self-immune, immunized from the charge of genocide. And the court accepted that correctly. Countries are subject to jurisdiction only if they accept it. Well, that\u2019s us."

    "input": "JS:What do you see \u2014 or how would you analyze right now, the posture of the United States toward India and China, in particular? I mean, two massive countries representing a large portion of the world\u2019s population, relative to the size of the United States for certain, but the economic pressure that the United States is putting on both India and China right now, what are the consequences of the U.S. posture toward both India and China right now?",
    "output": "Well, it\u2019s different. For one thing the United States is quite supportive of the Indian government. India has a neo-fascist government. The Modi government is working hard to destroy Indian democracy, turn India into a racist, Hindu kleptocracy, attack Muslims, conquer Kashmir \u2014 not a word about that. The United States supports all that. It\u2019s very supportive. It\u2019s a close ally, a close ally of Israel \u2014 our kind of guy, in other words, so no problem. And the problem with India is it doesn\u2019t go far enough. It doesn\u2019t go as far as we want it to, to join in the assault against Russia. It is playing a neutral game like all of the Global South saying: Yeah, it\u2019s a crime, but we\u2019re not going to get involved in your game. And the other thing is, India is participating, but not as actively as the U.S. would like in its policy of what the Biden administration calls \u201cencircling China.\u201d One of our major policy, Russia\u2019s kind of a sideline, but the major policy is to encircle China \u2014 containment is out of fashion, so encircle China \u2014 with sentinel states, that\u2019s the term that\u2019s used, armed to the teeth with massive offensive capacity to protect ourselves from what\u2019s called the threat of China. That\u2019s a ring of states from South Korea, Japan, Australia, India \u2014 except India is not joining actively enough \u2014 which we will provide, the Biden administration has just recently announced providing advanced precision missiles aimed at China. In the case of Australia, the United States, along with Britain, its puppy dog, is providing Australia with advanced nuclear submarines, advertised as able to get into Chinese ports without being detected and to destroy the Chinese fleet in two or three days. China has an ancient prehistoric fleet there \u2014 they don\u2019t even have nuclear submarines \u2014 old fashioned diesel submarines. Meanwhile, the United States is enhancing its own capacity to defend ourselves. So far, we have Trident nuclear submarines, which are able to, each one, one submarine, can destroy almost 200 cities anywhere in the world with a nuclear strike. But that\u2019s not enough. We\u2019re now moving to more advanced, I think it\u2019s called Virginia-class submarines, which will be far more destructive. And that\u2019s our policy towards China. We also have an economic policy. The United States just passed a bipartisan, two-party supported act to improve the U.S. technology, science infrastructure, not because it would be good for the United States \u2014 we couldn\u2019t consider that \u2014 but because it would compete with China. It\u2019s the compete-with-China bill. So if we want to have better science and technology, it is because we have to beat down China, make sure China doesn\u2019t get ahead of us. Let\u2019s not work with China, to deal with truly existential problems like global warming, or less serious but severe problems, like pandemics and nuclear weapons. Let\u2019s compete with them and make sure we can beat them down \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s important \u2014 and get ahead of them. It\u2019s a pathology. You can\u2019t imagine anything more lunatic. Incidentally: What is the China threat? It\u2019s not that China\u2019s got a very brutal, harsh government. But the U.S. never cares about things like that. Deals with them easily. The China threat, there\u2019s an interesting article about it by an Australian statesman, well-known international statesman, former prime minister, Paul Keating, who reviews the various elements of the China threat, and concludes, finally, that the China threat is that China exists. And he\u2019s correct. China exists and does not follow U.S. orders. That\u2019s no good. You have to follow U.S. orders. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re in trouble. Well, most countries do. Europe does. Europe despises U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran, strongly opposes them, but it observes them because you don\u2019t step on the toes of the godfather. So they observe U.S. sanctions. China doesn\u2019t. China\u2019s engaged in what the State Department once called \u201csuccessful defiance\u201d of U.S. policies. That was 1960s when the State Department was explaining why we have to torture Cuba, carry out a terrorist war against it, almost leading to nuclear war, impose highly destructive sanctions \u2014 we\u2019re still at it after 60 years, opposed by the entire world. Look at the votes in the General Assembly 184-2, U.S. and Israel. We have to do it as the liberal state department explained in the 1960s because of Cuba\u2019s successful defiance of U.S. policies going back to 1823. The Monroe Doctrine, which stated the U.S. determination to dominate the hemisphere \u2014 [we] weren\u2019t strong enough to do it at the time, but that\u2019s the policy. And Cuba is defying it successfully. That\u2019s no good. China\u2019s not Cuba, it\u2019s much bigger. It\u2019s successfully defying U.S. policies. So no matter how brutal it is, who cares? We support other brutal states all the time, but not successful defiance of U.S. policies. So therefore, we have to encircle China, with sentinel states, with advanced weapons aimed at China, which we have to maintain and upgrade, and ensure that we overwhelm anything in China\u2019s vicinity. That\u2019s part of our official policy. It was formulated by the Trump administration, Jim Mattis, in 2018, taken over by Biden. We have to be able to fight and win two wars with China and Russia. I mean, that\u2019s beyond insanity. The war with either China or Russia means: Nice knowing you, goodbye civilization, we\u2019re done. But we have to be able to win and fight two of them. And now with Biden, we have to expand it to encircling China with sentinel states to which we provide more advanced weapons, while we upgrade our huge destructive capacity. Like we don\u2019t want those weak nuclear submarines which can destroy 200 cities. That\u2019s sissy stuff. Let\u2019s go beyond. And then Putin gave the United States a tremendous gift. The war in Ukraine was criminal, but also from his point of view, utterly stupid. He gave the United States the fondest wish; it could have handed Europe to the United States on a golden platter. I mean, throughout the whole Cold War, one of the major issues in international affairs was whether Europe would become an independent force in international affairs, what was called a third force, maybe along the lines that Charles de Gaulle outlined, or that Gorbachev outlined when the Soviet Union collapsed; common European home, no military alliances, cooperation between Europe and Russia, which had become integrated into peaceful commercial blood. That\u2019s one option. The other option is what\u2019s called the Atlanticist program, implemented by NATO. The United States calls the shots and you obey, that\u2019s the Atlanticist program. Of course, the U.S. has always supported that one, and has always won. Now Putin solved it for the United States. He said: OK. You get Europe as a subordinate. Europe goes ahead and arms itself to the teeth to protect itself from an army, which Europe says gleefully, is incapable of conquering cities 20 miles from its border. So therefore, we have to arm ourselves to the teeth to defend ourselves from the onslaught of this extraordinarily powerful force against NATO. I mean, if anybody\u2019s observing this from outer space, they\u2019d be cracking up in laughter. But not in the offices of Lockheed Martin. They think it\u2019s terrific. Even better in the offices of Exxon Mobil. That\u2019s the interesting part. There were some hopes, not major hopes, but some hopes of dealing with a climate crisis that is gonna destroy organized human life on Earth. Not tomorrow, but in the process of doing it. Current, most plausible projections are three degrees Centigrade increase over pre-industrial levels by 20 by the end of the century. That\u2019s catastrophic. I mean, doesn\u2019t mean everybody dies, but it\u2019s a total catastrophe. Well, there were moves to stop that. Now they\u2019ve been reversed."

That\u2019s what somebody from outer space would be looking at. That\u2019s us, OK?",
    "output": "JS:I know, Noam, we have to wrap up. But I do want to note that just in recent days we\u2019ve heard now that the White House is proposing a record-shattering military budget, in excess of $813 billion. And you know, this would be a much longer conversation if we kept it going. But it\u2019s really a number of very significant things that have happened over the course of this war, from the perspective of the U.S. and NATO, among them Germany lifting its cap on the amount of its GDP that it will spend on defense, the pipeline of weapons. And many European countries have been very hesitant to get super-involved with transferring weapons systems and now there\u2019s discussion of even more permanent NATO bases. And I think part of what you\u2019re getting at, which I think is important for people to understand, is that Vladimir Putin, for whatever reasons he made the decision to do this in Ukraine, ultimately has created conditions that the U.S. has long wished were there for the United States to assert total dominance over European decision-making on issues of militarism. It also is an enormous boondoggle for the war industry. And I think that it\u2019s hard to \u2014 go ahead. And the fossil fuel industry. JS:And the fossil fuel industry. And I think that as we watch the horrors of human destruction and mass murder happening in Ukraine, we also must find a way to think of the long-term consequences of the actions of our own government. And unfortunately, when you raise these issues, when I raised them, when others do right now, in the U.S. media contexts, there is this Neo McCarthyite response, where to question the dominant narrative, or to question the motives of those in power, is now treated as an act of treason, or it\u2019s traitorous or you are a Putin stooge or are being paid in rubles. This is a very dangerous trend that we\u2019re witnessing where to question the state now is being very publicly and consistently equated with being a traitor. That\u2019s an old story. JS:It\u2019s an old story, but also with social media, and the fact that so many people now could have their comments spread around, and the cohesion of messaging that we\u2019re seeing \u2014 it is an old story, Noam, of course, and you\u2019ve written multiple books about this very phenomenon. What I\u2019m getting at is that it now is just permeating every aspect of our culture, where to question those in power, which is the job of journalists, which is the job of thinking, responsible people in a democratic society, those things are being attacked as acts of treason, basically. As always has been the case. We have a dramatic example of it right in front of us: Julian Assange. A perfect example of a journalist who did the job of providing the public with information that the government wants suppressed. Information, some of it about U.S. crimes but other things. So he\u2019s been subjected to years of torture \u2014 torture \u2014 that\u2019s the U.N. Repertory torture decision, now being held in a high-security prison, subjected to the possibility of extradition to the United States where he\u2019ll be severely punished for daring to do what a journalist is supposed to do. Now take a look at the way the media are reacting to this. First of all, they used everything WikiLeaks exposed, happily used it, made money out of it, improved their reputations. Are they supporting Assange, and this attack on the person who performed the honorable duty of a journalist and is now being tortured? Not that I\u2019ve seen. They\u2019re not supporting it. We\u2019ll use what he did, but then we\u2019ll join the jackals who are snapping at his feet. OK? That\u2019s now. It goes far back. You go back to 1968, the peak of the war in Vietnam, when real mass popular popular opinion was developing. When McGeorge Bundy, national security adviser for Kennedy and Johnson wrote a very interesting article in Foreign Affairs, a main establishment journal, in which he said: Well, there are legitimate criticisms of some of what we\u2019ve done in Vietnam, like we made tactical errors, we should have done things a little differently. And then he said, there are also the wild men in the wings, who question our policies beyond tactical decisions \u2014 terrible people. We\u2019re a democratic country, so we don\u2019t kill them. But you got to get rid of these wild men in the wings \u2014 [that\u2019s] 1968. You go to 1981: U.N. ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick devises the notion of moral equivalence. She said: If you dare to criticize the United States, you\u2019re guilty of moral equivalence. You\u2019re saying we\u2019re just like Stalin and Hitler. So you can\u2019t talk about the United States. There\u2019s another term that\u2019s used now. It\u2019s: whataboutism. If you talk about what the U.S. is doing right now, it\u2019s whataboutism, you can\u2019t do that. You\u2019ve got to adhere firmly to the party line, strictly to the party line. We don\u2019t have the kind of force that Hitler and Stalin had. But we can use obedience, conformity \u2014 a lot of things we\u2019ve been talking about. And you get a sort of similar result \u2014 not new. And yes, you\u2019re right, it has to be combatted. We have to deal with what\u2019s happening. And that includes what we are now doing to Ukraine, as we\u2019ve discussed, both by inaction and action, we\u2019re fighting to the last Ukrainian to quote Ambassador Freeman again. And it should be legitimate to say that if you care anything about Ukrainians. If you don\u2019t care anything about them, fine, just silence. JS:On that note, Noam Chomsky, I want to thank you very much for taking the time to be with us and for all of your work. I really appreciate you taking the time this evening. Good to talk to you."

    "output": "China could act to advance the prospects for a peaceful negotiated settlement in Ukraine. It seems that the Chinese leadership sees no advantage in doing so. China\u2019s \u201cinformation system\u201d appears to be pretty much conforming to the Russian propaganda line. But more generally, it doesn\u2019t seem to diverge much from a fairly common stance in the Global South, illustrated graphically by the sanctions map. The states joining in sanctions against Russia are in the Anglosphere and Europe, as well as Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. The rest of the world condemns the invasion, but is mostly standing aloof. This should not surprise us. It is nothing new. We recall well that the Iraq invasion had virtually no global support. Less familiar is the fact that the same was true of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan after 9/11. A few weeks after the invasion, an international Gallup poll asked the question: \u201cOnce the identity of the [9/11] terrorists is known, should the American government launch a military attack on the country or countries where the terrorists are based or should the American government seek to extradite the terrorists to stand trial?\u201d The wording reflects the fact that their identity was not known. Even eight months later, in his first major press conference, FBI Director Robert Mueller could only affirm that al-Qaeda was suspected of the crime. If the poll had asked about actual U.S. policy, the very limited support would doubtless have been even lower. World opinion overwhelmingly favored diplomatic-judicial measures over military action. Opposition to invasion was particularly strong in Latin America, which has a little experience with U.S. intervention. The free press spared Americans knowledge of international opinion. It was therefore able to proclaim that \u201cthe opposition [to the U.S. invasion] was mostly limited to the people who are reflexively against the American use of power.\u201d Quite a few suffer from this malady, apparently. Global opinion today should come as no great surprise. China\u2019s unwillingness to devote its efforts to a negotiated settlement of the Ukraine conflict deserves criticism, but it is hard to see how such criticism can properly come from Americans. After all, China is adhering to official U.S. policy. Simply put, the policy is to \u201cfight to the last Ukrainian for Ukrainian independence\u201d while offering no way to save Ukraine from further tragedy. Even worse, current policy undermines such hopes by informing Putin that he has no way out: It\u2019s The Hague or proceed to destroy Ukraine. The quote and the opinions just paraphrased are those of one of the most astute and widely respected U.S. diplomats, Ambassador Chas Freeman, who goes on to spell out the options, and to remind us of the history. Like anyone who cares in the least about the fate of Ukrainians, Ambassador Freeman recognizes that the only alternative to Russian destruction of Ukraine \u2014 which, with their backs to the wall, Putin and his narrow circle of silovikican implement \u2014 is a negotiated settlement that will be ugly, offering the aggressors an escape. He also carries the history back further than we have done in our earlier discussions, back to the Congress of Vienna of 1814, which followed the Napoleonic Wars. Metternich and other European leaders, he observes, \u201chad the good sense to reincorporate [defeated] France into the governing councils of Europe,\u201d overlooking its virtual conquest of Europe. That led to a century of substantial peace in Europe, which had long been the most violent part of the world. There were some wars, but nothing like what preceded. The century of peace ended with World War I. Freeman goes on to remind us that the victors in the war did not have the good sense of their predecessors: \u201cThe victors \u2014 the United States and Britain and France \u2014 insisted on excluding Germany from a role in the affairs of Europe, as well as this newly formed Soviet Union, the result was World War II and the Cold War.\u201d"

Or should it become an independent \u201cthird force\u201d along Gaullist lines, accommodating Russia within a Europe without military alliances from the Atlantic to the Urals?",
    "output": "The question arose starkly when the USSR collapsed, and Mikhail Gorbachev outlined the vision of a \u201ccommon European home\u201d with no military alliances from Lisbon to Vladivostok. In a limited form, the concept was revived by French President Emmanuel Macron in his recent abortive interchanges with Putin. If there had been anyone in the Kremlin who resembled a statesman, they would have leaped at the opportunity to explore something like the Gorbachev vision. Europe has strong reasons to establish close relations with Russia, ranging from commerce to security. Whether such efforts might have succeeded, avoiding the Ukraine tragedy, we can only guess. The answer could only have been found out by trying. Instead, the hard men in Moscow turned to violence, compounding their criminal aggression with self-defeating foolishness. The Gorbachev conception had some partial U.S. support within the framework of the Partnership for Peace, a U.S. initiative intended to provide a cooperative security system with a limited relation to NATO. Ambassador Freeman, who had a significant role in establishing it, describes its fate in words that are worth heeding: What happened in 1994, which was a midterm election year, and 1996, which was a presidential election year, was interesting. In 1994, Mr. Clinton was talking out of both sides of his mouth. He was telling the Russians that we were in no rush to add members to NATO, and that our preferred path was the Partnership for Peace. The same time he was hinting to the ethnic diasporas of Russophobic countries in Eastern Europe \u2014 and, by the way, it\u2019s easy to understand their Russophobia given their history \u2014 that, no, no, we were going to get these countries into NATO as fast as possible. And in 1996 he made that pledge explicit. [In] 1994 he got an outburst from [Boris] Yeltsin, who was then the president of the Russian Federation. [In] 1996 he got another one, and as time went on, when Mr. Putin came in, he regularly protested the enlargement of NATO in ways that disregarded Russia\u2019s self-defense interests. So, there should have been no surprise about this. For 28 years Russia has been warning that at some point it would snap, and it has, and it has done it in a very destructive way, both in terms of its own interests and in terms of the broader prospects for peace in Europe. None of this provides any excuse for Putin\u2019s invasion, Freeman emphasizes. But it is important to understand that, \u201cThere were those people in the United States who were triumphalist about the end of the Cold War.... This allowed the United States to incorporate all the countries right up to Russia\u2019s borders and beyond them, beyond those borders in the Baltics, into an American sphere of influence. And, essentially, they posited a global sphere of influence for the United States modeled on the Monroe Doctrine. And that\u2019s pretty much what we have.\u201d Russian leadership tolerated Clinton\u2019s violation of the firm U.S. commitment to Gorbachev not to extend NATO beyond East Germany. They even tolerated George W. Bush\u2019s further provocations, and U.S. military actions that struck directly at Russian interests, undertaken in such a way as to humiliate Russia. But Ukraine and Georgia were red lines. That was clearly understood in Washington. As Freeman continues, no Russian leader was likely to tolerate the NATO expansion into Ukraine that began after the 2014 \u201ccoup, [carried out] to prevent neutrality or a pro-Russian government in Kiev, and to replace it with a pro-American government that would bring Ukraine into our sphere.... So, since about 2015 the United States has been arming, training Ukrainians against Russia,\u201d effectively treating Ukraine \u201cas an extension of NATO.\u201d As we\u2019ve discussed, that stance became explicit policy in Biden\u2019s September 2021 official statement, possibly a factor in Russia\u2019s decision to escalate to direct aggression a few months later. Crucially, to repeat, current U.S. policy is to \u201cfight to the last Ukrainian\u201d while offering no way to save Ukraine from further tragedy and in fact undermining such hopes by informing Putin that he has no way out: It\u2019s The Hague or proceed to destroy Ukraine. China is probably relatively satisfied with the course of events. Very likely the same is true in Washington. Both have gained from the tragedy. And the euphoria among weapons and fossil fuel producers is unconcealed as they lead the way toward indescribable catastrophe, underscored in vivid terms by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report of April 4."

    "input": "Turkey\u2019s position over the war in Ukraine is to maintain neutrality while acting as a mediator in the Russian-Ukrainian crisis. Can Turkey continue to maintain such a balancing act since we know that it has been supplying military assistance to Ukraine since 2019 and that it is aligned with the geo-strategic vision of Washington over Ukraine?",
    "output": "Turkey has had an ambiguous position in global affairs for many years. It is a member of NATO, but the EU has rejected its appeals for membership on human rights grounds. In the 1990s, Turkey was indeed responsible for hideous crimes: its massive state terror against its Kurdish population, leaving tens of thousands dead, 3,500 towns and villages destroyed, a flood of hundreds of thousands of people from the devastated Kurdish regions to miserable slums in Istanbul. The crimes were mostly concealed by the \u201cfree press,\u201d perhaps because Clinton was pouring arms into Turkey, the flow escalating as atrocities mounted. Turkey became the leading recipient of U.S. military aid (apart from Israel-Egypt, a separate category), extending a very close correlation between human rights abuses and U.S. aid that goes far back, but somehow does not detract from its much-lauded nobility. By 2000, Turkish state crimes were abating, and in the following years the situation greatly improved \u2014 something I was able to witness personally, with much appreciation. By 2005, under President Recep Erdo\u011fan\u2019s increasingly harsh rule, the progress ended and reversed. That might have been in part a reaction to the continued refusal of the European Union to accept Turkish membership, ignoring the great steps forward in recent years and fortifying the sense that Europeans simply won\u2019t accept Turks into their club. Since then, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rule has become far more brutal, again targeting Kurds but also attacking civil and human rights on a broad front. And he has been trying to turn Turkey into a major actor in regional affairs, with hints of a renewed Ottoman caliphate. He accepts Russian weapons over strong U.S. objections but remains a central part of the NATO system of regional \u2014 by now global \u2014 dominance. The \u201cbalancing act\u201d with regard to Ukraine is a case in point. If Turkey can facilitate negotiations that will bring the Ukraine horrors to an end, that will be a most welcome development, to be applauded. We can only speculate about what the chances are while the U.S. insists on perpetuating the conflict \u201cto the last Ukrainian\u201d while blocking an ugly negotiated settlement that is the alternative to destruction of Ukraine and perhaps even nuclear war."

    "output": "It doesn\u2019t look likely in the near future. Europe could manage to end the use of Russian coal and oil, but gas is a different matter. That requires pipelines, which it would take years to build, or transport facilities for liquified natural gas that barely exist. But the question we should be asking I think is different. Can we ascend to the wisdom of the reactionary tyrants who provided Europe with a century of peace in Vienna in 1814? Can we move towards the Gorbachev vision of a European common home with no military alliances, a conception not too far from the U.S.-initiated Partnership for Peace that was undermined by President Clinton? Can some resemblance to statesmanship appear in today\u2019s Russia? Such questions as these should, I think, be in the forefront of our thinking, and our active engagement in trying to influence discussion and debate, and policy choices."

    "input": "Evidence of Russian war crimes is mounting. Can Putin be prosecuted for war crimes in Ukraine?",
    "output": "Prosecution for war crimes, in the real world, is \u201cvictor\u2019s justice.\u201d That was clear from the Nuremberg Tribunal and was not even concealed in the accompanying Tokyo Tribunal. At Nuremberg, saturation bombing of densely settled urban areas was excluded because it was a specialty of the Allies. German war criminals were exculpated if they could show that the Allies carried out the same crimes. In subsequent years, the Nuremberg principles were thrown out the window. They have only recently been discovered as a cudgel to beat official enemies. There can be no thought of trying the U.S. for its many horrendous crimes. An effort was once made to bring the U.S. to justice for its war against Nicaragua. The U.S. responded to the International Court of Justice orders to end the crimes by sharply escalating them while the press dismissed the court as a \u201chostile forum\u201d as shown by its daring to convict the U.S. (perTheNew York Times\u2019s editors), following ample precedent. Putin might be tried for crimes if he is overthrown within Russia and Russia can be treated as a defeated country. That is what the record indicates. Imaginably, the world might rise to a level of civilization in which international law can be honored instead of righteously wielded against selected targets. We should never cease efforts to bring that about. In doing so, we should not succumb to the illusions fostered by the global doctrinal systems."

People can feel very virtuous about denouncing Trump. But Public Citizen warns, \u201cEvery day we witness a further slide toward authoritarianism under Trump.\u201d Are you concerned about that?",
    "output": "I\u2019m less concerned than they are. I think the system is resilient enough to withstand a figure who is defying subpoenas, defying congressional orders and so on. I think Trump is in many ways underestimated. He\u2019s a highly skilled politician who is very successful in what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s got two major constituencies. One is the actual, standard constituency, the Republican Party \u2014 both parties, but much more the Republicans \u2014 private wealth, corporate power. You\u2019ve got to keep them satisfied. Then there is the voting base. Here, what\u2019s happened to the Republicans over the years is pretty interesting. During the neoliberal period, both parties have shifted to the right. By the 1970s, the Democrats had pretty much abandoned the working class. The last gesture of support for the working class was the Humphrey-Hawkins bill in 1978, a full employment bill that former President Jimmy Carter watered down so it didn\u2019t really mean anything. But since then, the Democrats have simply handed the working class over to their main class enemy: the Republicans. Some little changes here and there, but it\u2019s pretty substantial. The Democrats have become what used to be called moderate Republicans. The Republicans, meanwhile, have just gone off the edge.... They\u2019ve just become \u201ca radical insurgency.\u201d You see it almost daily. Recently, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that if Republicans have a chance to appoint someone else to the Supreme Court in an election year, \u201cFine, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d When it was Obama, he said, \u201cNo, in an election year you can\u2019t do it.\u201d They have simply abandoned any pretense of being a parliamentary party, and upped it to the jugular. But meanwhile, we\u2019re going to support private wealth, corporate power with utter dedication. You can\u2019t get votes that way. There are not enough people that are going to say, \u201cFine, let\u2019s do that.\u201d What the Republicans have had to do since the 1970s is to try to kind of cobble together a voting constituency on some grounds other than their actual policies. It\u2019s been very interesting to watch it. It started with former President Richard Nixon and his Southern strategy. The civil rights movement alienated Southern racists. The Nixon team pretty openly said, \u201cWe can pick up votes by being racist.\u201d They didn\u2019t use the word, but essentially did by catering to the racist elements of the South that are opposed to the civil rights movement. It was then picked up by one of the chief Republican strategists, Paul Weyrich. He noticed in the mid-1970s that Republicans could get lots of votes if they pretended \u2014 stresspretended\u2014 to be opposed to abortion. The Republican Party had been almost completely pro-choice. Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Barry Goldwater, all of them, their position in the 1960s was that the state has nothing to say about things like abortion. It\u2019s a matter between a woman and her doctor. Weyrich recognized that Republicans can get the votes of Northern Catholics, workers and Evangelical Christians, who are a huge population in the U.S., if they pretend to be opposed to abortion. Instantly, they all became passionately opposed to abortion. That\u2019s now one of the leading planks of the Republican Party. Guns is another one. \u201cWe have to be pro-guns. We can pick up people this way.\u201d A good part of the population, especially the working class, has indeed suffered under the neoliberal programs instituted since the Reagan years. We can\u2019t tell people, \u201cLook, we\u2019re screwing you, so we have to find some scapegoat who is responsible for it.\u201d In the case of Reagan, it was outright racist: It was the Black \u201cwelfare queens,\u201d the Black woman driving up in a limousine to the welfare office to steal your hard-earned money, all that stuff. Now it\u2019s immigrants. \u201cThe immigrants are coming to steal your jobs,\u201d or \u201cChina is going to take your jobs.\u201d It\u2019s kind of amazing to watch it work. For example, forget immigrants \u2014 that\u2019s so transparent we don\u2019t have to talk about it. There\u2019s almost 100 percent agreement that China is taking our jobs. But how is China taking our jobs? Does China have a gun to the heads of the CEOs of Apple and GM and Microsoft, and says, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to send jobs here?\u201d It\u2019s the corporate managers who are deciding to do it. So if you don\u2019t want the jobs to go to China, you should be saying, \u201cWell, the corporate managers shouldn\u2019t have the right to make that decision.\u201d So, who should have the right? If you believe in democracy, it should be the people who work in the enterprise. But where are we now? Back to the gentleman named Karl Marx in the mid-19th century. We should have worker control of enterprises. So the logical argument about China stealing our jobs goes straight to workers\u2019 control of enterprises, the main theme of the American working class in the early Industrial Revolution. Somehow you don\u2019t read about that. So, China is taking our jobs, immigrants are taking our jobs, welfare mothers are stealing from you, you have to have guns, you can\u2019t have abortions, etc. Republicans had to cobble together a voting constituency including these sectors and also the relatively affluent. Trump voters are mostly pretty affluent. They, of course, are going to vote Republican for their own reasons. What\u2019s happened in the past roughly 15 years, when you take a look at every Republican primary, when somebody came up from the popular base, they are so \u201ccrazy\u201d that the Republican establishment wasn\u2019t able to tolerate them and was able to beat them down \u2014 people like Michele Bachmann, Rick Santorum and others. The difference in 2016 is they couldn\u2019t beat them down. Trump is a skillful politician, and he managed not only to win the nomination, but to put the entire party in his pocket to a remarkable extent. Amazingly, he\u2019s been able to maintain the support of people that he is shafting at every turn with his pretense of being the guy who is standing up for you. It\u2019s very interesting to watch it. There was an interesting article inThe New York Times, a long study of Midwest farmers. These are not poor farmers with a garden in their backyard; these are pretty affluent farmers. But they\u2019re suffering from the trade war. They\u2019re losing their market for soybeans. But they\u2019re still supporting Trump. And the reason is, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop the Chinese practices. It\u2019s unfair to us. And Trump says he supports us.\u201d In fact, the main person they quote in the article says, \u201cTrump says, \u2018farmers are marvelous people, I love you,\u2019 and I\u2019m going to vote for him.\u201d So, a little sweet-talk. And also, a little bit of cash doesn\u2019t hurt. So there\u2019s now $16 billion sent to farmers in the Midwest to try to compensate for their trade losses. Where does that $16 billion come from? It comes from the trade war. Tariffs are simply a tax on consumers. That\u2019s what a tariff is: A tariff, the way it spells itself out, it ends up with higher prices for consumers. And it\u2019s not small. The New York Fed just estimated the annual tax bite as about $800 per family. That\u2019s a big tax increase under Trump, which helps pay off his constituency. It\u2019s a pretty nice scam, when you look at it, and they\u2019re carrying it off very effectively. Trump and Steve Bannon and the rest are pretending to be the tribunes of the people, defending the American worker from all these attacks. By now, there are a few Democrats who are starting to talk about it, but as a party, the Democrats have pretty much abandoned the working class. In fact, many working people voted for Obama believing his nice rhetoric about hope and change. But within about two years that was shattered. By the 2010 midterm elections, it was gone. Trump comes along and says, \u201cI\u2019m your defender. I\u2019m going to protect you from not only foreign enemies but the people who are stealing your jobs.\u201d He\u2019s carrying it off, and the Democrats are helping him. Take this laser-like focus on the Robert Mueller report, Russiagate. It was obvious from the beginning that they were not going to find very much. They\u2019ll find that Trump\u2019s a crook. OK, we knew that already \u2014 but they\u2019re not going to find any real collusion with the Russians, and they didn\u2019t. They\u2019re not going to find any real significant Russian impact on the election. There couldn\u2019t be. You want to talk about interference with the election? Campaign funding by the wealthy and the corporate sector utterly overwhelms the effect of any imaginable foreign interference. That\u2019s the real interference with elections. Whatever the Russians might have tried to do, it\u2019s a piece of straw in a haystack. And, of course, it\u2019s nothing compared with U.S. interference with Russian elections, let alone other countries, where we just overthrow the government. But the Democrats focused all their hopes on somehow \u201cMueller is going to save us,\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s not look at Trump\u2019s policies.\u201d But these policies are murderous. Trump\u2019s climate policy may literally be a virtual death knell for the species. It\u2019s not a small thing. There\u2019s almost no talk about it. The Nuclear Strategy Review, which escalates the threat of nuclear war significantly, that\u2019s not under discussion. The tax scam, which was just a gift to the rich and the corporations, a double gift. For one thing, it poured a lot of money into their pockets. Secondly, it created a huge deficit which can be used as a justification for cutting social spending. We can go on and on. None of this is being discussed. Let\u2019s instead talk about the fact that maybe somebody in the Trump campaign talked to a Russian oligarch who placed an ad somewhere. It\u2019s as if the Democrats are working for him, like paid agents of the Trump campaign. Maureen Dowd, a columnist forThe New York Times, writes, \u201cMy head hurts, puzzling over whether Trump is just a big blowhard who\u2019s flailing around, or a sinister genius laying traps to get himself impeached to animate the base ahead of the election.\u201d Trump ... understands nothing about the economy; he doesn\u2019t care about the world. But he is extremely skillful in carrying off the primary tasks that a \u201cnarcissistic megalomaniac\u201d has to achieve. One is maintaining the support of wealth and corporate power, which he is doing. That\u2019s handed over to McConnell and the rest. They make sure that that works. And it\u2019s working brilliantly. Corporate profits are going through the roof. It\u2019s fantastic. Wages are pretty much stagnating. What more can he ask? But the other thing is: He has to keep his voting base energized, and he\u2019s doing it, very well. Impeachment is another case. If the Democrats move to impeachment, I think they\u2019re going to shoot themselves in the foot. You can see exactly what\u2019s going to happen. Suppose the House impeaches Trump. It goes to the Senate. The Senate is in Trump\u2019s pocket. They\u2019ll exonerate him. Then what happens? Trump starts making speeches about how, \u201cI\u2019m exonerated, the Deep State and the treacherous Democrats are trying to destroy the guy who is standing up for you against your enemies.\u201d Just like what happened with the Mueller report. They were just walking into a trap. If you want to be concerned, you want to overturn Trump on the basis of his actual crimes, the thing to look at is not Congress, it\u2019s the New York State Attorney General\u2019s office, which is carrying out, apparently, careful investigations of Trump\u2019s fraudulent dealings over decades, which I\u2019m sure are going to pile up crime after crime, maybe enough to send him to prison after he\u2019s out of office. That\u2019s probably where it\u2019s all going to come out. But in general terms, that\u2019s a minor issue. He\u2019s not my favorite person, as you can see, but as compared with the crimes he may have committed, the fraud in New York with his hotels and so on, that\u2019s very minor as compared with the fact that he\u2019s escalating the race to disaster. This is the most important decision in human history. We\u2019ve got a couple of years to try to deal somehow with the environmental crisis. It can be controlled. It\u2019s not easy, but it can be done. If you waste a couple of years by trying to escalate the crisis, you might just push us over the edge. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve looked at this, one of the most amazing documents in human history that came out of the Trump administration, from a part of the bureaucracy, naturally. It was a 500-page environmental assessment study done by the Transportation Administration, the point of which was to argue that we should not impose new emissions controls on cars and trucks. And they had a very sound argument. The argument is, \u201cLook, we\u2019re going off the cliff anyway, and car emissions don\u2019t make that much of a difference. So who cares?\u201d Their estimate was that by the end of this century, global temperatures will have risen 4 degrees Centigrade. That\u2019s way beyond what the scientific consensus says will make life unlivable. So, what they\u2019re saying is, \u201cWe\u2019re finished, it\u2019s all done anyhow, by the end of the century, everything will be destroyed. So why stop driving?\u201d Can you think of anything like this in human history, ever? Hitler wasn\u2019t saying. \u201cLet\u2019s destroy the world.\u201d Of course, they\u2019re assuming that ... nobody is going to do anything about it. But all of this passes without anybody paying attention. Let\u2019s worry about whether Russia had some minor influence on the election. Talk about the young people in Congress like Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and others, and teen activist students like Greta Thunberg of Sweden, Haven Coleman of Denver, and other young people involved in Extinction Rebellion and the Sunrise Movement. That\u2019s very exciting. That\u2019s really the hope for the future. These are very impressive people. Extinction Rebellion are great people. The Sunrise Movement \u2014 which is, after all, a small group of young people \u2014 succeeded partly just through their activism, like sitting-in in congressional offices, got some support from especially Representative Ocasio-Cortez, who is doing a wonderful job. They managed to put on the agenda the Green New Deal. Now, of course, it immediately got denounced as a \u201ccrazy\u201d this, that, and the other thing. But it\u2019s a great achievement. There has to be some kind of Green New Deal if we\u2019re going to survive. And they managed to move it from obscurity to the legislative agenda, along with Ed Markey, the senator from Massachusetts. That\u2019s a real achievement. And there are very solid, substantive proposals as to how you could implement these proposals. One of the most detailed and persuasive I know of is by Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. It can be done. These groups have broken through the silence and apathy on it. That\u2019s a remarkable achievement. In fact, it\u2019s the hope for survival of any kind of civilized life. This is not a small thing. The human species is facing questions that have never arisen before: Is organized human life going to survive in any recognizable form? We\u2019re approaching the level of global warming of roughly 125,000 years ago, when sea levels were about 25 feet higher than they are now. You don\u2019t have to have much of an imagination to know what that means. Shall we race toward it the way the Trump administration and the Republican Party wants us to do? Or shall we do something about it, the way Sunrise Movement and Extinction Rebellion and Ocasio-Cortez want to do? That\u2019s the decision that has to be made. It\u2019s good that you bring that up, because that\u2019s of extraordinary importance. This is a lightly edited transcript of an interview thatfirstaired onAlternative Radio."

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: After months of fighting, there is still very little hope of peace in Ukraine. Russia is now refocusing its efforts on taking control of the east and south of the country with the likely intent of incorporating them into the Russian Federation, while the West has signaled that it will step up military support for Ukraine. In the light of these developments, Ukrainian officials have ruled out a ceasefire or concessions to Moscow, although President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also went on record saying that only diplomacy can end the war. Don\u2019t these two positions cancel each other out? Doesn\u2019t a mutually acceptable agreement for a war to end always contain concessions? Indeed, back in March, the Ukrainian government had signaled its intention that it was willing to make big concessions for the war to end. So, what\u2019s going on? Could it be that neither side is fully invested in peace?",
    "output": "I\u2019ll come back to the questions, but we should carefully consider the stakes. They are very high. They go far beyond Ukraine, desperate and tragic as the situation is there. Anyone with a moral bone in their body will want to think through the issues carefully, without heroic posturing. Let\u2019s consider what is at stake. First, of course, is Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, a crime (to repeat once again) that can be compared to the U.S. invasion of Iraq or the Hitler-Stalin invasion of Poland, the kind of crimes against peace for which Nazi war criminals were hanged \u2014 though only the defeated are subject to punishment in what we call \u201ccivilization.\u201d In Ukraine itself, there will be a terrible toll as long as the war persists. There are broader consequences, which are truly colossal. That\u2019s no exaggeration. One is that tens of millions of people in Asia, Africa and the Middle East are literally facing starvation as the war proceeds, cutting off desperately needed agricultural supplies from the Black Sea region, the primary supplier for many countries, including some already facing utter disaster, like Yemen. Will return to how that is being handled."

One is the widely voiced call for a no-fly zone, which means attacking anti-aircraft installations inside Russia. The extreme danger of such proposals is understood by some, notably the Pentagon, which so far has been able to veto the most dangerous proposals. For how long in the prevailing mood?",
    "output": "These are horrendous prospects. Prospects: whatmighthappen. When we look at what actuallyishappening, it gets worse. The Ukraine invasion has reversed the much-too-limited efforts to address global warming \u2014 which will soon become global frying. Prior to the invasion, some steps were being taken to avert catastrophe. Now that has all been thrown into reverse. If that continues, we\u2019re done. One day the IPCC issues another severe warning that if we are to survive, we must start right now to reduce use of fossil fuels. Right now, no delay. The next day President Biden announces vast new expansion of fossil fuel production. Biden\u2019s call to increase fossil fuel production is sheer political theater. It has nothing to do with today\u2019s fuel prices and inflation, as claimed. It will be years before the poisons reach the market \u2014 years that could be spent on moving the world rapidly to renewable energy. That\u2019s perfectly feasible, but barely discussed in the mainstream. There\u2019s no need to comment here. The topic has recently been expertly analyzed by economist Robert Pollin in another of his essential contributions to understanding this critical issue of survival and acting on that understanding. It is crystal clear that settling the Ukraine crisis is of extraordinary significance, not just for Ukraine itself but because of the calamitous consequences beyond if the war persists. What then can we do to facilitate ending the tragedy? Let\u2019s begin with virtual truism. The war can end in one of two ways: Either there will be a diplomatic settlement, or one side will capitulate. The horror will go on unless it ends with a diplomatic settlement or capitulation. That at least should be beyond discussion. diplomatic settlement differs from capitulation in one crucial respect: Each side accepts it as tolerable. That\u2019s true by definition, so it is beyond discussion. Proceeding, a diplomatic settlement must offer Putin some kind of escape hatch \u2014 what is now disdainfully called an \u201coff-ramp\u201d or \u201cappeasement\u201d by those who prefer to prolong the war. That much is understood even by the most dedicated Russia-haters, at least those who can entertain some thought in their minds beyond punishing the reviled enemy. One prominent example is the distinguished foreign policy scholar Graham Allison of Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, who also has long direct experience in military affairs. Five years ago, he instructed us that it was then clear that Russia as a whole is a \u201cdemonic\u201d society and \u201cdeserves to be strangled.\u201d Today he adds that few can doubt that Putin is a \u201cdemon,\u201d radically unlike any U.S. leader, who at worst only make mistakes, in his view. Yet even Allison argues that we must contain our righteous anger and bring the war to a quick end by diplomatic means. The reason is that if the mad demon \u201cis forced to choose between losing and escalating the level of violence and destruction, then, if he\u2019s a rational actor, he\u2019s going to choose the latter\u201d \u2014 and we may all be dead, not just Ukrainians. Putin is a rational actor, Allison argues. And if he is not, all discussion is useless because he can destroy Ukraine and maybe even blow up the world at any moment \u2014 an eventuality we cannot prevent by any means that won\u2019t destroy us all. Proceeding with truism, to oppose or even act to delay a diplomatic settlement is to call for prolonging the war with its grim consequences for Ukraine and beyond. This stand constitutes a ghastly experiment: Let\u2019s see whether Putin will slink away quietly in total defeat, or whether he will prolong the war with all its horrors, or even use the weapons that he indisputably has to devastate Ukraine and to set the stage for terminal war. All of this seems obvious enough. Or it should, but not in the current climate of hysteria, where such near truisms elicit a great flood of utterly irrational reactions:The monster Putin won\u2019t agree, it\u2019s appeasement, what about Munich, we have to establish our own red lines and keep to them whatever the monster says, etc. There is no need to dignify such outpourings with a response. They all amount to saying: Let\u2019s not try, and instead undertake the ghastly experiment. The ghastly experiment is operative U.S. policy, and is supported by a wide range of opinion, always with noble rhetoric about how we must stand up for principle and not permit crime to go unpunished. When we hear this from strong supporters of U.S. crimes, as we commonly do, we can dismiss it as sheer cynicism, the Western counterpart to the most vulgar apparatchiks of the Soviet years, eager to eloquently denounce Western crimes, fully supportive of their own. We also hear it from opponents of U.S. crimes, from people who surely do not want to carry out the ghastly experiment that they are advocating. Here other issues arise: the rising tide of irrationality that is undermining any hope for serious discourse \u2014 a necessity if Ukraine is to be spared indescribable tragedy, and even if the human experiment is to persist much longer. If we can escape cynicism and irrationality, the humane choice for the U.S. and the West is straightforward: seek to facilitate a diplomatic settlement, or at least don\u2019t undermine the option. On this matter, official Western opinion is split. France, Germany and Italy have been calling for negotiations to establish a ceasefire and move toward a diplomatic settlement. The U.S. and Britain, the West\u2019s two warrior states, object. Their position is that the war must proceed: the ghastly experiment. The longstanding U.S. policy of undermining diplomacy, which we have reviewed in detail in earlier discussions, was presented in sharper form a few weeks ago at a meeting of NATO powers and others organized by Washington at the U.S. airbase in Ramstein, Germany. The U.S. issued the marching orders: The war must be continued so as to harm Russia. That is the widely advocated \u201cAfghan model\u201d that we have discussed: In the words of the definitive scholarly study of the topic, it is the policy of \u201cfighting Russia to the last Afghan\u201d while seeking to delay Russian withdrawal and to undermine the UN diplomatic efforts that finally brought the tragedy to an end. Explaining U.S.-NATO goals at Ramstein, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that \u201cwe want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can\u2019t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.\u201d Let\u2019s think about it. How do we ensure that Russia can never again invade another country? We put aside here the unthinkable question of whether reshaping U.S. policy might contribute to this end, for example, examining Washington\u2019s openly declared refusal to consider any Russian security concerns and many other actions that we have discussed. To achieve the announced goal, it seems that we must at least reenact something like the Versailles Treaty, which sought to ensure that Germany would not be able to go to war again. But Versailles did not go far enough, as was soon made clear. It follows that the new version being planned must \u201cstrangle the demon\u201d in ways that go beyond the Versailles effort to control the Huns. Perhaps something like the Morgenthau Plan. That is the logic of the pronouncements. Even if we don\u2019t take the words seriously and give them a limited interpretation, the policy entails prolonging the war, whatever the consequences are for Ukrainians and the \u201ccollateral damage\u201d beyond: mass starvation, possible terminal war, continued destruction of the environment that sustains life."

    "output": "As always, there are two directions to explore: military or diplomatic. \u201cWar/War or Jaw/Jaw\u201d in the phrase attributed to Churchill, who assigned priority to the latter. War/War is official U.S. policy: Send advanced anti-ship missiles to force Russia to stop blockade of ports. Beyond the Russian flagship, more can be sunk. Will the Russians observe quietly? Maybe. How would the U.S. react in similar circumstances? We can put that aside. Another possibility, proposed by theWall Street Journaleditors, is \u201cto use warships to escort merchant ships out of the Black Sea.\u201d The editors assure us that it would conform to international law, and that Russians will stop at nothing. So, if they react, we can proclaim proudly that we upheld international law as all goes up in flames. The editors observe that there are precedents: \u201cThe U.S. has marshalled allies for such a mission twice in recent decades. In the late 1980s the U.S. reflagged and protected Kuwaiti oil tankers as they sailed out of the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq tanker war.\u201d That is correct, though there is a small oversight. The U.S. did indeed intervene directly to provide crucial support for Reagan\u2019s good friend Saddam Hussein in his invasion of Iran. That was after supporting Saddam\u2019s chemical warfare that killed hundreds of thousands of Iranians, and even charging Iran for Saddam\u2019s massacre of Kurds with chemical warfare. Iran was the demon of the day. A fine precedent. Those are options for ending the blockade, keeping to convention by restricting attention to force rather than possible peaceful steps. Are there any? One cannot know without thinking about them, looking at what is transpiring, and trying. It may be of relevance that Russia did propose something of the sort, though in our increasingly totalitarian culture, it can be reported only at the extreme margins. Quoting from a libertarian website: Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko ... [argued] his country is not solely responsible for the burgeoning food emergency while pointing to Western sanctions blocking the export of grain and fertilizers. \u201cYou have to not only appeal to the Russian Federation but also look deeply at the whole complex of reasons that caused the current food crisis. [Sanctions] interfere with normal free trade, encompassing food products including wheat, fertilizers and others,\u201d Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko said. Is it worth considering? Not in our culture, which automatically reaches for the revolver. The reflexive preference for violence, and its grim consequences, have not been overlooked abroad. That\u2019s common in the Global South, which has ample experience with Western practice, but even among allies. The editor of the Australian international affairs journalArenadeplores the rigid censorship and intolerance of even mild dissent in U.S. media, concluding that \u201cThis means it is almost impossible within mainstream opinion to simultaneously acknowledge Putin\u2019s insupportable actionsandforge a path out of the war that does not involve escalation, and the further destruction of Ukraine.\u201d Quite correct. And unless we can escape this self-imposed trap, we are likely to march on to annihilation. It is all reminiscent of the early days of World War I when the Great Powers enthusiastically undertook a self-destructive war, but this time with incomparably more severe consequences lurking not far in the distance. I\u2019ve said nothing about what Ukrainians should do, for the simple and sufficient reason that it\u2019s not our business. If they opt for the ghastly experiment, that\u2019s their right. It\u2019s also their right to request weapons to defend themselves from murderous aggression."

    "input": "Here we return to what is our business: ourselves. How should we respond to these requests? I\u2019ll repeat in a moment my personal belief, but here too a little honesty wouldn\u2019t hurt. There are many ringing declarations upholding the sacred principle that victims of criminal assault must be supported in their just demand for weapons to defend themselves. It is easy to show that those who issue them don\u2019t believe a word of what they are saying, and in fact, almost always, strongly support providing weapons and crucial diplomatic support to the aggressor. To take just the most obvious case, where are the calls to provide Palestinians with weapons to defend themselves from half a century of brutal criminal occupation in violation of Security Council orders and international law \u2014 or even to withdraw the decisive U.S. support for these crimes?",
    "output": "One can, of course, read the reports of U.S.-backed settler-IDF atrocities in the Israeli press, in the daily columns of the great journalist Gideon Levy. And we can read the withering reports by another honorable Israeli journalist, Amira Hass, reviewing the bitter condemnations of the ecological damage caused by the \u201cdemonic\u201d Russians in Ukraine, which somehow miss the Israeli attack on Gaza last May, when \u201cIsraeli shells ignited hundreds of tons of pesticides, seeds, fertilizers, other chemicals, nylon and plastic sheeting, and plastic piping in a warehouse in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahia.\u201d The shelling ignited 50 tons of hazardous substances, with lethal effects on the shattered population, which is living in conditions of bare survival, international agencies report, after decades of U.S.-backed Israeli sadism. It is \u201cchemical warfare by indirect means,\u201d the highly reputable Palestinian legal research and activism agency al-Haq reports, after extensive investigation. None of this, and vastly more, inspires any word in the mainstream about ending huge U.S. support for the murderous occupier, or of course for any means of defense. But enough of such outrageous \u201cwhataboutism,\u201d otherwise known as elementary honesty, and a common theme outside of our tightly controlled doctrinal system. How should the principle apply in the unique case of Ukraine, where the U.S. for once opposes aggression? My own view, to repeat, is that the Ukrainian request for weapons should be honored, with caution to bar shipments that will escalate the criminal assault, punishing Ukrainians even more, with potential cataclysmic effects beyond."

The diplomatic solution advanced by many experts is the one based on a Ukrainian treaty of neutrality while Russia drops its objections to Ukraine\u2019s membership in the EU, although the road to membership will inevitably be very long. However, there is one scenario which is rarely discussed, yet this is where things could be headed. This is Graham Allison\u2019s \u201cKorean scenario,\u201d where Ukraine is divided into two parts without a formal treaty. Do you regard this as a likely or possible scenario?",
    "output": "It is one of a number of possible very ugly outcomes. Speculation seems to me rather idle. Better, I think, to devote our energy to thinking of constructive ways to overcome the developing tragedies \u2014 which, again, go far beyond Ukraine. We might even envision a broader framework, something like the \u201ccommon European home\u201d with no military alliances proposed by Mikhail Gorbachev as an appropriate framework of world order after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Or we might pick up some of the early wording of the Partnership for Peace, initiated by Washington in the same years, as when President Clinton in 1994 assured Boris Yeltsin that \u201cthe broader, higher goal [is] European security, unity and integration \u2013 a goal I know you share.\u201d These promising prospects for peaceful integration were soon undercut, however, by Clinton\u2019s plans for NATO expansion, over strong Russian objections, long preceding Putin. Such hopes can be revived, to the great benefit of Europe, Russia and world peace generally. They might have been revived by Putin had he pursued Macron\u2019s tentative initiatives towards accommodation instead of foolishly choosing criminal aggression. But they are not necessarily dead. It\u2019s useful to recall some history. For centuries, Europe was the most vicious place on earth. For French and Germans, the highest goal in life was to slaughter one another. As recently as my childhood, it seemed unimaginable that it could ever end. A few years later, it did end, and they have since been close allies, pursuing common goals in a radical reversal of a long history of brutal conflict. Diplomatic successes need not be impossible to achieve."

    "input": "It is now a commonplace that the world has entered a new Cold War. In fact, even the once-unthinkable scenario of using nuclear weapons in warfare is no longer taboo talk. Have we entered an era of confrontation between Russia and the West, a geostrategic and political rivalry reminiscent of the Cold War?",
    "output": "Nuclear warfare had better become taboo talk, and unthinkable policy. We should be working hard to restore the arms control regime that was virtually dismantled by Bush II and Trump, who didn\u2019t have quite enough time to complete the job but came close. Biden was able to rescue the last major relic, New Start, just days before its expiration. The arms control regime should then be extended, looking forward to the day when the nuclear powers will join the UN Treaty on Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, now in force. Other measures can be taken to alleviate the threat, among them implementing Nuclear Weapons-Free Zones (NWFZ). They exist in much the world, but are blocked by U.S. insistence on maintaining nuclear weapons facilities within them. The most important would be a NWFZ in the Middle East. That would end the alleged Iranian nuclear threat and eliminate any thin pretext for the criminal U.S.-Israeli bombings, assassinations and sabotage in Iran. That crucial advance in world peace is, however, blocked by the U.S. alone. The reason is not obscure: It would interfere with Washington\u2019s protection of Israel\u2019s huge nuclear arsenal. That has to be kept in the dark. If exposed, U.S. law would come into play, threatening Washington\u2019s extraordinary support for Israel\u2019s illegal occupation and constant crimes \u2014 another topic that is unmentionable in polite society. All steps should be taken to remove the scourge of nuclear weapons from the earth, before they destroy all of us. In the world system that is taking shape, the confrontation with Russia is something of a sideshow. Putin has handed Washington a marvelous gift by turning Europe into a virtual U.S. vassal, cutting off the prospects that Europe might become an independent \u201cthird force\u201d in international affairs. A consequence is that the fading Russian kleptocracy, with its huge stock of natural resources, is being incorporated into the Chinese-dominated zone. This growing system of development and loans stretches over Central Asia and reaches to the Middle East through the UAE and Maritime Silk Road, with tentacles stretching to Africa and even to Washington\u2019s \u201clittle region over here,\u201d as FDR\u2019s Secretary of War Henry Stimson described Latin America while calling for dismantling of all regional associations except for our own. It is the \u201cChina threat\u201d that is the centerpiece of U.S. strategy. The threat is enhanced if resource-rich Russia is incorporated as a junior partner. The U.S. is now vigorously reacting to what it calls \u201cChinese aggression,\u201d such as devoting state resources to developing advanced technology and internal repression. The reaction, initiated by Trump, has been carried forward by Biden\u2019s policy of \u201cencirclement\u201d based on a ring of \u201csentinel states\u201d off the coast of China. These are armed with advanced weapons, recently upgraded to high-precision weapons, aimed at China. The \u201cdefense\u201d is backed by a fleet of invulnerable nuclear submarines that can destroy not just China but the world many times over. Since that is not good enough, they are now being replaced as part of the enormous Trump-Biden military expansion. The stern U.S. reaction is understandable. \u201cChina, unlike Russia, is the only country powerful enough to challenge U.S. dominance on the world stage,\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced in describing this intolerable threat to world order (aka U.S. dominance). While we talk of \u201cisolating Russia,\u201d if not \u201cstrangling\u201d this \u201cdemonic\u201d society, most of the world is keeping its ties open to Russia and to the China-dominated global system. It is also watching, bemused, as the U.S. destroys itself from within. Meanwhile the U.S. is developing new alliances, which will presumably strengthen in November if the GOP takes over Congress and manages to gain long-term control of the political system through its quite open efforts to undermine political democracy. One such alliance is being firmed up right now with the racist self-declared \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d of Hungary, which has crushed free speech and independent cultural and political institutions and is worshipped by leading figures of the GOP from Trump to media star Tucker Carlson. Steps toward that goal were taken a few days ago at the conference of far right elements in Europe that met in Budapest, where the star attraction was the Conservative Political Action Conference, a core element of the Republican Party. The alliance between the U.S. and the European extreme right has a natural ally in the Abraham alliance forged by Trump and Jared Kushner. This widely hailed alliance formalized the tacit relations between Israel and the most reactionary states of the MENA (Middle East-North Africa) region. Israel and Hungary already have close relations, based on shared racist values and a sense of grievance for being shunned by more liberal elements in Europe. Another natural partner is today\u2019s India, where Prime Minister Modi is shattering Indian secular democracy and establishing a Hindu ethnocracy, bitterly repressing the Muslim population, and extending India\u2019s domains with his brutal occupation of Kashmir. The U.S. is already virtually alone in recognizing the two existing illegal MENA occupations in violation of Security Council orders: Israel\u2019s annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights and of vastly expanded Greater Jerusalem, and Morocco\u2019s annexation of Western Sahara to extend its near monopoly of irreplaceable phosphate reserves. With the GOP in power, the U.S. might complete the picture by recognizing Hindu India\u2019s violent takeover of Kashmir. new global order is taking shape, but the U.S.-Russia confrontation is not its central element. Speaking of a new Cold War, I must say I am in utter disbelief by the delirious reaction on the part of so many in the U.S. to analyses seeking to provide background to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and the same is true in connection with voices calling for diplomacy to end the war. They conflate explanation and justification and willfully ignore historical facts, such as the decision of the U.S. to expand NATO eastward without consideration to Russia\u2019s security concerns. And it isn\u2019t as if this decision was greeted at the time with approval by leading diplomats and foreign affairs experts. Former U.S. envoy to the Soviet Union Jack F. Matlock Jr. and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned against NATO expansion and Ukraine\u2019s inclusion. George Kennan\u2019s reaction to the Senate\u2019s 1998 ratification of NATO eastward expansion up to the borders of Russia was even more blunt: \u201cI think it is the beginning of a new cold war.... I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely.... I think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever.... Of course there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then [the Nato expanders] will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are \u2013 but this is just wrong.\u201d Were these top U.S. diplomats Russian pawns, as is often said today of anyone offering background information why Russia has invaded Ukraine? I like to have your thoughts on this matter. You can add others who delivered stern warnings to Washington that it was reckless and needlessly provocative to ignore Russia\u2019s announced security concerns, including current CIA Director William Burns and his predecessor Stansfield Turner, even hawks like Paul Nitze, in fact almost the whole of the diplomatic corps who had any deep knowledge of Russia. Those warnings were particularly strong with regard to Russia\u2019s concerns, well before Putin and including every Russian leader, over incorporation into NATO of Georgia and Ukraine. These are Russia\u2019s geostrategic heartland as is evident by a look at a topographic map and recent history, Operation Barbarossa. Are they all Russian pawns? I suppose that can be claimed in today\u2019s climate of frenzied irrationality, a danger to ourselves and the world. It\u2019s useful to have a look at chapters of history that are far enough back so that we can consider them with some degree of detachment. An obvious choice, as mentioned earlier, is the First World War. It is now recognized that it was a terrible war of futility and stupidity in which none of the agents had a tenable stand. That\u2019s now. Not at the time. As the great powers of the day stumbled into war, the educated classes in each proclaimed the nobility of the cause of their own state. A famous manifesto of prominent German intellectuals appealed to the West to support the land of Kant, Goethe, Beethoven, and other leading figures of civilization. Their counterparts in France and Britain did the same, as did the most distinguished American intellectuals when Woodrow Wilson joined the war shortly after having won the 1916 election on a platform of Peace without Victory. Not everyone took part in the celebration of the grandeur of their own state. In England, Bertrand Russell dared to question the party line; in Germany, he was joined by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht; in the U.S., by Eugene Debs. All were imprisoned. Some, like Randolph Bourne in the U.S., escaped that fate. Bourne was only barred from all liberal journals. This pattern is not a departure from the historical norm. It pretty much is the norm, regrettably. The World War I experience did provide important lessons. That was recognized very quickly. Two highly influential examples are Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays. Lippmann went on to become a most prominent U.S. 20th century public intellectual. Bernays became one of the founders and intellectual leaders of the huge public relations industry, the world\u2019s major propaganda agency, devoted to undermining markets by creating uninformed consumers who will make irrational choices and to fostering the unbridled consumerism that ranks alongside the fossil fuel industries as a threat to survival. Lippmann and Bernays were Wilson-Roosevelt-Kennedy liberals. They were also members of the propaganda agency established by President Wilson to convert a pacifist population to raging anti-German fanatics, the Creel Committee on Public Information, a properly Orwellian title. Both were highly impressed by its success in \u201cmanufacture of consent\u201d (Lippmann), \u201cengineering of consent\u201d (Bernays). They recognized this to be a \u201cnew art in the practice of democracy,\u201d a means to ensure that the \u201cbewildered herd\u201d \u2014 the general population \u2014 can be \u201cput in their place\u201d as mere \u201cspectators,\u201d and will not intrude into domains where they do not belong: policy decisions. These must be reserved for the \u201cintelligent minority,\u201d \u201cthe technocratic and policy-oriented intellectuals\u201d in the Camelot version. That is pretty much reigning liberal democratic theory, which Lippmann and Bernays helped forge. The conceptions are by no means new. They trace back to the early democratic revolutions of the 17th and 18th centuries in England and then its U.S. colony. They were invigorated by the World War I experience. But while the masses may be controlled with \u201cnecessary illusions\u201d and \u201cemotionally potent oversimplifications\u201d (in the words of Reinhold Niebuhr, venerated as the \u201ctheologian of the liberal establishment\u201d), there is another problem: the \u201cvalue-oriented intellectuals\u201d who dare to raise questions about U.S. policy that go beyond tactical decisions. They can no longer be jailed, as during World War I, so those in power now seek to expel them from the public domain in other ways."

I suspect that Trump and associates regard their legal challenges as a success in what seems a plausible strategy: keep the pot boiling and keep the loyal base at fever pitch, furious about the \u201cstolen\u201d election and the efforts of the insidious elites and the \u201cdeep state\u201d to remove their savior from office. That strategy seems to be working well.

Meanwhile, this strategy requires keeping the wrecking ball \u2014 Trump\u2019s symbol \u2014 actively at work. Do nothing to deal with the pandemic, even delay in providing data to Biden\u2019s team while a top nurse\u2019s union warns of \u201ccatastrophic death\u201d in the growing chaos while \u201cour hospitals are knowingly still not prepared\u201d and the government is on vacation.

On that day, which will live in infamy among the faithful, Trump might set up what he claims is an authentic government in Mar-a-Lago, with Mitch McConnell\u2019s Senate in his pocket and a furious popular base. The next step would be to make the country ungovernable, a specialty that McConnell has been perfecting for a decade and that an accomplished demagogue like Trump can manage reflexively. Everything that goes wrong can be blamed on the treacherous \u201celites.\u201d Trump and associates might, as some have speculated, set up an alternative media empire, incorporating talk radio and other far right outlets but perhaps notFox, which has shown occasional signs of disobedience. Then they could come roaring back into power in 2022-2024, feeding on growing discontent. They would then be free to destroy the environment with abandon and maximize short-term profit for their primary constituency, impose discipline on what remains of government, tame the media, institute harsh authoritarian measures elsewhere, and continue with their abject service to their masters \u2014 the real elites, the very rich and the corporate sector, the decision-makers, as recent academic research once again establishes very clearly. It\u2019s of no little interest that we have to turn to the world\u2019s leading business journal, the very respectable LondonFinancial Times, to read some elementary truths about what could once claim to be a leading democracy: \u201cAnyone with a pulse,\u201dFinancial TimesAssociate Editor Rana Foroohar writes, \u201cknows that in the US today the system is rigged in favour of the wealthy and powerful.\u201d Foroohar adds: One particularly illuminating paper [just cited] found that considering the opinions of anyone outside that top 10 per cent was a far less accurate predictor of what happened to government policy. The numbers showed that: \u2018not only do ordinary citizens not have uniquely substantial power over policy decisions; they have little or no independent influence on policy at all\u2019. We have had decades of legislative tweaks to everything from tax policy to corporate governance and accounting standards that have favoured capital over labour. Supreme Court decisions such as theCitizens Unitedcase have also dramatically increased the amount of money funneled into political campaigning. This has left the nature of America\u2019s political economy perilously close to an oligopoly. If the Trump strategy is anything like the speculation outlined above, the prevailing oligopoly might look like a fond memory. Anger and contempt for \u201celites\u201d is not a mistake, even if the real elites are effectively concealed by the propaganda machine. The masters do not much like Trump. His vulgar antics undermine their preferred image as humane and benign figures who labor tirelessly for the common good, directing \u201csoulful corporations,\u201d trustworthy guardians in whose hands our future is safe. But they may find it hard to fault someone whose major legislative achievement is a tax scam designed to enrich the very rich while imposing a heavier tax burden on the undeserving (and unwitting) majority."

    "input": "Trump\u2019s hopes for denying a Biden election win lie with a legislative revolt \u2014 that is, by overturning the certification process. Experts indicate that such an outcome has a very slim chance of taking place, yet the fact that it is even considered as a possibility surely reveals something utterly problematic about the way democracy functions in the United States. Can you share your views with us on this matter, and discuss what it would take to make the democratic process in the U.S. actually democratic?",
    "output": "Whatever the validity of my speculation about the goals and success of the Trump strategy, the whole election reveals the extreme fragility of American democracy. It is amazing enough that someone whose malevolent decision to provoke an out-of-control pandemic has just killed tens of thousands of Americans can even run for office, even carry much of the country with him, and that the political party that virtually shines his shoes can win a resounding victory at every level apart from the White House. That\u2019s putting aside Trump\u2019s major \u201cachievements\u201d: driving to near-term environmental catastrophe and sharply increasing the threat of terminal war, crimes that scarcely registered in the electoral process. Trump\u2019s rejection of the election results is just the coda to his quite impressive campaign to accomplish an authoritarian takeover, with the executive purged while his close associate Mitch McConnell converts the Senate into a joke, functioning almost entirely to enrich the rich and stack the judiciary with young, far right justices whose task will be to impose the ultra-reactionary Trump-McConnell agenda for a generation. But that is only the icing on the cake. Foroohar of theFinancial Times, whom I quoted earlier, is quite right that the malaise cuts far deeper. It traces back as far as the constitutional order, which was established on the principle that \u201cthose who own the country ought to govern it\u201d (first Chief Justice John Jay) and that a prime duty of government is to \u201cprotect the minority of the opulent against the majority\u201d (leading framer James Madison). Hard struggles ensued to overturn the \u201cFramers\u2019 Coup\u201d against democracy \u2014 the title of the gold standard of scholarship on the framing of the Constitution, by Michael Klarman. There have been periods of progress and of regression. We have just endured 40 years of regression, the neoliberal regime, a bitter assault against democracy and on the kind of society that can sustain it. An estimate of the monetary cost to the general population was recently given by the Rand Corporation: $47 trillion transferred from the working and middle classes (90 percent of the population) to the super-rich; the top 0.1 percent doubled their share of wealth to 20 percent of the total since Ronald Reagan. The Rand figures are a considerable underestimate. Tens of trillions more were \u201ctransferred\u201d after Reagan opened the spigots for tax havens, shell companies and other devices to rob the public. More were developed under Clinton\u2019s deregulatory mania. Reagan and his partner Margaret Thatcher moved at once to undermine the labor movement, setting in motion the campaigns to deprive working people of the primary means to resist the assault. The serious decline of functioning democracy is a virtual corollary of the radical concentration of wealth and dispatch of much of the general population to stagnation and precarity. There is no need to review the rest of the sordid story once again. But it is important to remember the deep roots of the undemocratic structure of the government. In the 18th century, despite the Framer\u2019s Coup, the U.S. Constitution was an important step toward democracy, so much so that the great statesmen of Europe invoked the venerable domino theory. They feared that \u201cthe pernicious doctrines of republicanism and popular self-rule\u201d spread by \u201cthe apostles of sedition\u201d who had freed themselves from Britain\u2019s grip might encourage similar \u201cvicious principles\u201d beyond. That was then. A lot has happened in 250 years. If the U.S. were to apply for membership in the European Union today, it would probably be rejected. The radically undemocratic character of the Senate would be sufficient reason. There is surely something a little odd about the respected doctrine of \u201coriginalism,\u201d holding that we should be bound by the ideas of a group of wealthy white slaveowners 250 years ago, even putting aside the cynical ways \u201coriginalist\u201d and \u201ctextualist\u201d doctrines are often applied in practice. Even without Trump, the United States would still be facing a severe constitutional crisis. But that is only a fraction of the problem. Democracy is at best a fragile reed when people spend most of their waking lives under the rule of a master with virtually absolute power. That was understood very well by working people in the early days of the industrial revolution, who struggled hard against this attack on their fundamental rights and personal dignity. They also expressed their concern that a day might come when wage slaves \u201cwill so far forget what is due to manhood as to glory in a system forced on them by their necessity and in opposition to their feelings of independence and self-respect,\u201d a day they hoped would be \u201cfar distant.\u201d Thoughts worth contemplating."

    "input": "Millions of Trump\u2019s supporters seem to believe that their leader actually won the election. In fact, there have even been signs claiming, \u201cWorld Knows Trump Won.\u201d In light of this, it seems to me that the contemporary United States is not simply a divided and polarized nation on political and ideological issues alone, but that we also have alternative epistemologies in operation: one segment of the population believes in actual facts and relies on science for an explanation of the world, while another segment of the citizenry is under the spell of falsehoods, disinformation and deception. How do you explain this peculiar phenomenon, especially since we are talking about a very rich and technologically advanced country?",
    "output": "little caution is needed here. This is the country of theScopestrial. When I was a student at an Ivy League college, lectures on the theory of evolution were introduced with the professor\u2019s warning that you don\u2019t have to believe this but it\u2019s important to know what some people think. Today, \u201cBoth Protestants and Catholics are considerably more likely to say evolution was guided or allowed by God than they are to say that humans evolved due to processes such as natural selection, or to say that humans have always existed in their present form.\u201d Over 40 percent of Americans expect the Second Coming by mid-century, while over 80 percent of the population believe in miracles. In some ways, we\u2019re not that far from centuries ago. It\u2019s also important to consider the devastating impact of the neoliberal regime on much of the country, with particular severity in rural areas that were also major centers of manufacturing. After steady growth for many years, employment in manufacturing declined from its 1979 peak of almost 20 million to under 13 million 40 years later. The decline was in large part the result of policy choices: bipartisan investor rights agreements, mislabeled \u201cfree trade agreements,\u201d which provided unparalleled protection and other rights to corporate power while setting working people in competition with the most poorly paid and repressed workers in the world. That has been a large factor in the devastation of rural America: towns depopulated or abandoned, no jobs or hospitals or other services, general malaise and a justified sense of having been abandoned. That\u2019s hardly conducive to participation in the most advanced sectors of global culture. The sources of the divide you mention are complex. The split, however, is very real. And it has major impacts. Right now, the country is in the grip of a severe pandemic. It was understood by scientists in 2003, after containment of the SARS epidemic, that another coronavirus was likely. The cultural divide soon emerged. When Obama took office in 2009, one of his first acts was to convene the president\u2019s scientific advisory council to request them to provide a pandemic response plan. They did. It was implemented, and remained in force until January 2017, when one of Trump\u2019s first acts was to dismantle it, opening the most anti-science administration in modern history, with consequences that we have seen on many fronts \u2014 and with effects on popular culture. The conflict of epistemologies is real. It is no simple matter to explain or to deal with it. The future will depend substantially on how the conflict is resolved."

What happens within the most powerful country in human history cannot fail to have an overwhelming impact on what eventuates \u2014 an impact even on survival of human society in any recognizable form.

    "input": "David Barsamian:Do you ever make the connection between the external violence of the U.S. state and what is happening internally with all the shootings and mass murders?",
    "output": "The U.S. is a very strange country. From the point of view of its infrastructure, the U.S. often looks like a \u201cThird World\u201d country.... Not for everybody, of course. There are people who can say, \u201cOK, fine, I\u2019ll go in my private jet or helicopter.\u201d Drive around any American city. They\u2019re falling apart. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the U.S. regularly a D, the lowest ranking, in infrastructure. This is the richest country in world history. It has enormous resources. It has advantages that are just incomparable in agricultural resources, mineral resources, huge territory, homogeneous. You can fly 3,000 miles and think you\u2019re in the same place where you started. There is nothing like that anywhere in the world. In fact, there are successes, like a good deal of the high-tech economy, substantially government-based but real. On the other hand, it\u2019s the only country in the developed world in which mortality is actually increasing. That\u2019s just unknown in developed societies. In the last several years, life expectancy has declined in the U.S. There is work by two major economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, who have carefully studied the mortality figures. It turns out that in the cohort roughly 25 to 50, the working-age cohort of whites, the white working class, there is an increase in deaths, what they call \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d: suicide, opioid overdoses, and so on. This is estimated at about 150,000 deaths a year. It\u2019s not trivial. The reason, it\u2019s generally assumed, is the economic stagnation since Reagan. In fact, this is the group that entered the workforce right around the early 1980s, when the neoliberal programs began to be instituted. That has led to a small slowdown in growth. Growth is not what it was before. There is growth, but very highly concentrated. Wealth has become extremely highly concentrated. Right now, according to the latest figures, 0.1 percent of the population holds 20 percent of the country\u2019s wealth; the top 1 percent holds roughly 40 percent. Half the population has negative net worth, meaning debts outweigh assets. There has been stagnation pretty much for the workforce over the whole neoliberal period. That\u2019s the group that we\u2019re talking about. Naturally, this leads to anger, resentment, desperation. Similar things are happening in Europe under the austerity programs. That\u2019s the background for what\u2019s misleadingly called \u201cpopulism.\u201d But in the U.S., it\u2019s quite striking. The \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d phenomenon seems to be a specific U.S. characteristic, not matched in other countries. Remember, there is no country in the world that has anything like the advantages of the U.S. in wealth, power and resources. It\u2019s a shocking commentary. You read constantly that the unemployment rate has reached a wonderful level, barely 3 percent unemployed. But that\u2019s pretty misleading. When you use Labor Department statistics, it turns out that the actual unemployment rate is over 7 percent. When you take into account the large number of people who have just dropped out of the workforce, labor force participation is considerably below what it was about 20-30 years ago. There are good studies of this by economists. You have roughly a 7.5 percent unemployment rate and stagnation of real wages, which have barely moved. Since the year 2000, there has been a steady decline in just median family wealth. As I said, for about half the population, it\u2019s now negative. In terms of guns, the U.S. is an outlier. We have 4 percent of the world\u2019s population with 40 percent of the globe\u2019s guns. There is an interesting history to that, very well studied. There\u2019s a recent book by Pamela Haag calledThe Gunning of America: Business and the Making of American Gun Culture. It\u2019s a very interesting analysis. What she shows is that after the Civil War, the gun manufacturers didn\u2019t really have much of a market. The U.S. government market had declined, of course, and foreign governments weren\u2019t much of a market. It was then an agricultural society, the late 19th century. Farmers had guns, but they were like tools, nothing special. You had a nice old-fashioned gun. It was enough to chase away wolves. They didn\u2019t want the fancy guns that the gun manufacturers were producing. So, what happened was, the first major, huge advertising campaign that was a kind of a model for others later. An enormous campaign was carried out to try to create a gun culture. They invented a Wild West, which never existed, with the bold sheriff drawing the pistol faster than anyone else and all this nonsense that you get in the cowboy movies. It was all concocted. None of it ever happened. Cowboys were sort of the dregs of society, people who couldn\u2019t get a job anywhere else. You hired them to push some cows around. But this image of the Wild West and the great heroes was developed. Along with it came the ads, saying something like,\u2018If your son doesn\u2019t have a Winchester rifle, he\u2019s not a real man, If your daughter doesn\u2019t have a little pink pistol, she\u2019ll never be happy.\u2019 It was a tremendous success. I suppose it was a model for later on, when the tobacco companies developed the \u201cMarlboro man\u201d and all this kind of business. This was the late 19th, early 20th century, the period in which the huge public relations industry was beginning to develop. It was brilliantly discussed by Thorstein Veblen, the great political economist, who pointed out that in that stage of the capitalist economy, it was necessary to fabricate wants, otherwise you couldn\u2019t maintain the economy that would generate great profit levels. The gun propaganda was probably the beginning of it. It goes on, pushing up to the recent period since 2008, the Supreme CourtHellerdecision. What they called Second Amendment rights have just become holy writ. They\u2019re [considered by some] the most important rights that exist, our sacred right to have guns, established by the Supreme Court, overturning a century of precedent. Take a look at the Second Amendment. It says, \u201cA well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\u201d Up until 2008, that was interpreted pretty much the way it reads, that the point of having guns was to keep a militia. Scalia, in his decision in 2008, reversed that. He was a very good scholar. He\u2019s supposed to be an originalist. He would pay attention to the intentions of the founders. If you read the decision, it\u2019s interesting. There are all kinds of references to obscure 17th century documents. Strikingly, he never mentions once the reasons the founders wanted the people to have guns, which are not obscure. One reason was that the British were coming. The British were the big enemy then. They were the most powerful state in the world. The U.S. barely had a standing army. If the British were going to come again, which in fact they did, you\u2019ve got to have militias to fight them off, so we have to have well-regulated militias. The second reason was, it was a slave society. This was a period where there were slave rebellions taking place all through the Caribbean. Slavery was growing massively after the revolution. There was deep concern. Black slaves often outnumbered whites. You had to have well-armed militias to keep them under control. There was yet another reason. The U.S. is maybe one of the rare countries in history which has been at war virtually every year since its founding. You can hardly find a single year when the U.S. wasn\u2019t at war. When you look back at the American Revolution, the textbook story is \u201ctaxation without representation,\u201d which is not false, but far from the whole story. Two major factors in the revolution were that the British were imposing a restriction on expansion of settlement beyond the Appalachian Mountains into what was called \u201cIndian country.\u201d The British were blocking that. The settlers wanted to expand to the West. Not just people who wanted land, but also great land speculators, like George Washington, wanted to move into the Western areas. \u201cWestern\u201d meant right over the mountains. The British were blocking that. At the end of the war, the settlers could expand. The other factor was slavery. In 1772, there was a very important and famous ruling by a leading British jurist, Lord Mansfield, that slavery is so \u201codious,\u201d his word, that it cannot be tolerated within Britain. It could be tolerated in the colonies, like Jamaica, but not within Britain. The U.S. colonies were essentially part of Britain. It was a slave society. They could see the handwriting on the wall. If the U.S. stays within the British system, it\u2019s going to be a real threat to slavery. That was ended by the revolution. But that meant, going back to the guns, you needed them to keep off the British, you needed them to control the slaves, you needed them to kill Indians. If you\u2019re going to attack the Indian nations \u2014 they were nations, of course \u2014 you\u2019re going to attack the many nations to the West of the country, you\u2019re going to have to have guns and militias. Ultimately, it was replaced later by a standing army. But take a look at the reasons you had to have guns for the founders. Not a single one of them applies in the 21st century. This is completely missing not only from Scalia\u2019s decision, but even from the legal debate over this. There is a legal literature debating theHellerdecision, but almost all of it is about the technical question of whether the Second Amendment is a militia right or an individual right. The wording of the amendment is a little bit ambiguous, so you can argue about it, but it\u2019s completely beside the point. The Second Amendment is totally irrelevant to the modern world; it has nothing to do with it. But it\u2019s become holy writ. So, you have this huge propaganda campaign. As a kid, I was affected by it. Wyatt Earp, guns, \u201ckill Indians,\u201d all that. It\u2019s spread all over the world. In France, they love cowboy movies. A totally fabricated picture of the West, but it was very successful in creating a gun culture. It\u2019s now become sanctified by the reactionary Supreme Court. So, yes, everybody has got to have a gun.... Talk about the First Amendment and press freedom and journalism, a trade which has come under attack from the self-styled \u201cextremely stable genius\u201d in the White House as \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d Talk about that and also about the Assange case. The First Amendment is a major contribution of American democracy. The First Amendment actually doesn\u2019t guarantee the right of free speech. What it says is that the state cannot take preemptive action to prevent speech. It doesn\u2019t say it can\u2019t punish it. So under the First Amendment, literally, you can be punished for things you say. It doesn\u2019t block that. It was nevertheless a step forward in the environment of the time that the U.S. in many ways did break through. With all of its flaws, the American Revolution was progressive in many respects by the standards of the time, even the phrase \u201cWe the people.\u201d Putting aside the flaws in implementation, the very idea was a breakthrough. The First Amendment was a step forward. However, it wasn\u2019t really until the 20th century that First Amendment issues really came on the agenda, at first with the dissenting opinions of Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Louis Brandeis in cases around the First World War, a little bit later. It\u2019s worth looking at how narrow these dissents were. The first major one, in theSchenckcase in 1917, was a case of somebody who published a pamphlet describing the war as an imperialist war and saying you don\u2019t have to serve in it. Support for free speech under the First Amendment was very narrow, as Holmes\u2019s dissent and then support for punishment showed. The case was a complete scandal, but even Holmes went along. In fact, the real steps toward establishing a strong protection of freedom of speech were actually in the 1960s. A major case wasTimes v. Sullivan. The State of Alabama had claimed what\u2019s called sovereign immunity, that you can\u2019t attack the state with words. That\u2019s a principle that holds in most countries \u2014 Britain, Canada, others. There was an ad published by the civil rights movement, which denounced the police in Montgomery, Alabama, for racist activities, and they had sued to block it. It went to the Supreme Court. The ad was in [The New York Times]. That\u2019s why it\u2019s calledTimes v. Sullivan. The Supreme Court for the first time, basically, struck down the doctrine of sovereign immunity. It said you can attack the state with words. Of course, it had been done, but now it became legal. There was a stronger decision a couple years later,Brandenburg v. Ohio, in 1969, where the Court ruled that speech should be free up to participation in an imminent criminal action. So, for example, if you and I go into a store with the intent to rob it, and you have a gun and I say, \u201cShoot,\u201d that\u2019s not privileged. But that\u2019s basically the doctrine. That\u2019s a very strong protection of freedom of speech. There\u2019s nothing like it anywhere, as far as I know. In practice, the U.S. has not a stellar record, but one of the better (maybe even the best record) in protection of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. That is indeed under attack when the press is denounced as the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d and you organize your rabid support base to attack the press. That\u2019s a serious threat."

Given that you were extremely skeptical of the polls from day one, what do you think contributed to the massive turnout for Trump, even as Biden saw an even more massive turnout? Or, to phrase the questions differently, why is nearly half the country continuing to support a dangerous charlatan leader with such a feverish passion?",
    "output": "The very fact that someone could be considered a serious candidate after just having killed tens if not hundreds of thousands of Americans through a disastrous response to COVID-19 is an extraordinary victory for Trump \u2014 and a defeat for the country, for the world and for hopes for a decent future. Some of Trump\u2019s victories are very revealing. A report onNPRdiscussed his victory in a solid Democratic county on the Texas-Mexico border with many poor Latinos that hadn\u2019t voted Republican for a century, since Harding. TheNPRanalyst attributes Biden\u2019s loss to his famous \u201cgaffe\u201d in the last debate, in which he said that we have to act to save human society from destruction in the not very distant future. Not his words, of course, but that\u2019s the meaning of his statement: that we have to make moves to transition away from fossil fuels, which are central to the regional economy. Whether that\u2019s the reason for the radical shift, or whether it\u2019s attributable to another of the colossal Democratic organizing failures, the fact that the outcome is attributed to the gaffe is itself indicative of the rot in the dominant culture. In the U.S., it is [considered] a serious \u201cgaffe\u201d to dare to hint that we have to act to avoid a cataclysm. Poor working people in the border area are not voting for the predictable consequences of Trump\u2019s race toward cataclysm. They may simply be skeptical about what science predicts. Sixty percent of conservative Republicans (35 percent of moderate Republicans) believe that humans are contributing \u201cnot too much/not at all\u201d to global warming. A poll reported inSciencefound that only 20 percent of Republicans trust scientists \u201ca lot...to do what is right for the country.\u201d Why then believe the dire predictions? These, after all, are the messages pounded into their heads daily by the White House and its media echo chamber. South Texan working people may not be ready to sacrifice their lives and communities today on the basis of claims in elite circles that they are instructed not to trust. These tendencies cannot be blamed solely on Trump\u2019s malevolence. They trace back to the failure of the Democratic Party to bring to the public a serious program to fend off environmental catastrophe while also improving lives and work \u2014 not because such programs don\u2019t exist; they do. But because they don\u2019t appeal to the donor-oriented Clintonite neoliberals who run the Democratic Party. There\u2019s more. Trump has shown political genius in tapping the poisonous currents that run right below the surface of American society. He has skillfully nourished and amplified the currents of white supremacy, racism and xenophobia that have deep roots in American history and culture, now exacerbated by fear that \u201cthey\u201d will take over \u201cour\u201d country with its shrinking white majority. And the concerns are deep. A carefulstudyby political scientist Larry Bartels reveals that Republicans feel that \u201cthe traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it,\u201d and more than 40 percent agree that \u201ca time will come when patriotic Americans have to take the law into their own hands.\u201d Trump has also skillfully tapped reservoirs of anger and economic resentment among the working and middle classes who have been subjected to the bipartisan neoliberal assault of the last 40 years. If they feel that they have been robbed, they have good reason. The Rand Corporation recently estimated transfer of wealth from the lower 90 percent to the very rich during the four neoliberal decades: $47 trillion, not small change. Looking more closely, the transfer was primarily to a small fraction of the very rich. Since Reagan, the top 0.1 percent has doubled their share of the country\u2019s wealth to an astonishing 20 percent. These outcomes are not the result of principles of economics or laws of history but of deliberate policy decisions. If decisions are shifted from government (\u201cgovernment is the problem,\u201d as Reagan claimed) they do not disappear. They are placed in the hands of the corporate sector, which must be guided solely by greed (per neoliberal economic guru Milton Friedman). With such guidelines in place, results are not hard to anticipate. On top of the near-$50 trillion train robbery, the international economy (\u201cglobalization\u201d) has been structured to set American working people in competition with those in low-wage countries with no workers\u2019 rights while the very rich are granted protection from market forces, by exorbitant patent rights, to take one example. Again, the effects of this bipartisan enterprise are not a surprise. Less educated workers may not know the details or understand the mechanisms that have been designed to undermine their lives, but they see the outcomes. The Democrats offer them nothing. They long ago abandoned the working class and have been full collaborators in the racket. Trump in fact harms workers even more than the opposition, but he excoriates \u201celites\u201d \u2014 while slavishly serving the super-rich and corporate sector, as his legislative program and executive orders amply demonstrate. Apart from almost daily steps to chip away at the environment that sustains life and to pack the judiciary top-to-bottom with far right young lawyers, the main achievement of the Trump-McConnell administration has been the tax scam of 2017: \u201ca delayed tax increase dressed up as a tax cut,\u201d economist Joseph Stiglitz explains. \u201cThe Trump administration has a dirty little secret: It\u2019s not just planning to increase taxes on most Americans. The increase has already been signed, sealed and delivered, buried in the pages of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\u201d The law was carefully designed to lower taxes initially so as to \u201choodwink\u201d Americans to think their taxes were being reduced, but with mechanisms to ensure that tax increases \u201cwould affect nearly everyone but people at the top of the economic hierarchy. All taxpayer income groups with incomes of $75,000 and under \u2014 that\u2019s about 65 percent of taxpayers \u2014 will face a higher tax rate in 2021 than in 2019.\u201d It\u2019s the same device that the George W. Bush Republicans used to sell their 2001 \u201ctax cut\u201d \u2014 for the rich."

We are not in the days of Richard Nixon, who had good reasons to question the legitimacy of the vote he lost in 1960, but had the decency to put the welfare of the country about his personal ambitions. Not Donald Trump. And the organization that grovels at his feet is not the political party of 60 years ago. Trump still has two months to wield the wrecking ball that has already diminished the United States, harmed the world and severely threatened the future. His penchant for wrecking everything he did not create, whatever the cost, is hard to miss. He might decide to go for broke."

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: Wartime propaganda has become in the modern world a powerful weapon in garnering public support for war and providing a moral justification for it, usually by highlighting the \u201cevil\u201d nature of the enemy. It\u2019s also used in order to break down the will of the enemy forces to fight. In the case of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Kremlin propaganda seems so far to be working inside Russia and dominating Chinese social media, but it looks like Ukraine is winning the information war in the global arena, especially in the West. Do you agree with this assessment? Any significant lies or war-myths around the Russia-Ukraine conflict worth pointing out?",
    "output": "Wartime propaganda has been a powerful weapon for a long time, I suspect as far back as we can trace the historical record. And often a weapon with long-term consequences, which merit attention and thought. Just to keep to modern times, in 1898, the U.S. battleshipMainesank in Havana harbor, probably from an internal explosion. The Hearst press succeeded in arousing a wave of popular hysteria about the evil nature of Spain. That provided the needed background for an invasion of Cuba that is called here \u201cthe liberation of Cuba.\u201d Or, as it should be called, the prevention of Cuba\u2019s self-liberation from Spain, turning Cuba into a virtual U.S. colony. So it remained until 1959, when Cuba was indeed liberated, and the U.S., almost at once, undertook a vicious campaign of terror and sanctions to end Cuba\u2019s \u201csuccessful defiance\u201d of the 150-year-old U.S. policy of dominating the hemisphere, as the State Department explained 50 years ago. Whipping up war myths can have long-term consequences. few years later, in 1916, Woodrow Wilson was elected president with the slogan \u201cPeace without Victory.\u201d That was quickly transmuted to Victory without Peace. A flood of war myths quickly turned a pacifist population to one consumed with hatred for all things German. The propaganda at first emanated from the British Ministry of Information; we know what that means. American intellectuals of the liberal Dewey circle lapped it up enthusiastically, declaring themselves to be the leaders of the campaign to liberate the world. For the first time in history, they soberly explained, war was not initiated by military or political elites, but by the thoughtful intellectuals \u2014 them \u2014 who had carefully studied the situation and after careful deliberation, rationally determined the right course of action: to enter the war, to bring liberty and freedom to the world, and to end the Hun atrocities concocted by the British Ministry of Information. One consequence of the very effective Hate Germany campaigns was imposition of a victor\u2019s peace, with harsh treatment of defeated Germany. Some strongly objected, notably John Maynard Keynes. They were ignored. That gave us Hitler. In a previous interview, we discussed how Ambassador Chas Freeman compared the postwar Hate Germany settlement with a triumph of statesmanship (not by nice people): The Congress of Vienna, 1815. The Congress sought to establish a European order after Napoleon\u2019s attempt to conquer Europe had been overcome. Judiciously, the Congress incorporated defeated France. That led to a century of relative peace in Europe. There are some lessons. Not to be outdone by the British, President Wilson established his own propaganda agency, the Committee on Public Information (Creel Commission), which performed its own services. These exercises also had a long-term effect. Among the members of the Commission were Walter Lippmann, who went on to become the leading public intellectual of the 20th century, and Edward Bernays, who became a prime founder of the modern public relations industry, the world\u2019s major propaganda agency, dedicated to undermining markets by creating uninformed consumers making irrational choices \u2014 the opposite of what one learns about markets in Econ 101. By stimulating rampant consumerism, the industry is also driving the world to disaster, another topic. Both Lippmann and Bernays credited the Creel Commission for demonstrating the power of propaganda in \u201cmanufacturing consent\u201d (Lippmann) and \u201cengineering of consent\u201d (Bernays). This \u201cnew art in the practice of democracy,\u201d Lippmann explained, could be used to keep the \u201cignorant and meddlesome outsiders\u201d \u2014 the general public \u2014 passive and obedient while the self-designated \u201cresponsible men\u201d will attend to important matters, free from the \u201ctrampling and roar of a bewildered herd.\u201d Bernays expressed similar views. They were not alone. Lippmann and Bernays were Wilson-Roosevelt-Kennedy liberals. The conception of democracy they elaborated was quite in accord with dominant liberal conceptions, then and since. The ideas extend broadly to the more free societies, where \u201cunpopular ideas can be suppressed without the use of force,\u201d as George Orwell put the matter in his (unpublished) introduction toAnimal Farmon \u201cliterary censorship\u201d in England. So it continues. Particularly in the more free societies, where means of state violence have been constrained by popular activism, it is of great importance to devise methods of manufacturing consent, and to ensure that they are internalized, becoming as invisible as the air we breathe, particularly in articulate educated circles. Imposing war-myths is a regular feature of these enterprises. It often works, quite spectacularly. In today\u2019s Russia, according to reports, a large majority accept the doctrine that in Ukraine, Russia is defending itself against a Nazi onslaught reminiscent of World War II, when Ukraine was, in fact, collaborating in the aggression that came close to destroying Russia while exacting a horrific toll. The propaganda is as nonsensical as war myths generally, but like others, it relies on shreds of truth, and has, it seems, been effective domestically in manufacturing consent. We cannot really be sure because of the rigid censorship now in force, a hallmark of U.S. political culture from far back: the \u201cbewildered herd\u201d must be protected from the \u201cwrong ideas.\u201d Accordingly, Americans must be \u201cprotected\u201d from propaganda which, we are told, is so ludicrous that only the most fully brainwashed could possibly keep from laughing. According to this view, to punish Vladimir Putin, all material emanating from Russia must be rigorously barred from American ears. That includes the work of outstanding U.S. journalists and political commentators, like Chris Hedges, whose long record of courageous journalism includes his service asTheNew York TimesMiddle East and Balkans bureau chief, and astute and perceptive commentary since. Americans must be protected from his evil influence, because his reports appear onRT. They have now been expunged. Americans are \u201csaved\u201d from reading them. Take that, Mr. Putin. As we would expect in a free society, it is possible, with some effort, to learn something about Russia\u2019s official position on the war \u2014 or as Russia calls it, \u201cspecial military operation.\u201d For example, via India, where Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had a long interview withIndia Today TVon April 19. We constantly witness instructive effects of this rigid indoctrination. One is that it isde rigueurto refer to Putin\u2019s criminal aggression in Ukraine as his \u201cunprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\u201d A Google search for this phrase finds \u201cAbout 2,430,000 results\u201d (in 0.42 seconds). Out of curiosity, we might search for \u201cunprovoked invasion of Iraq.\u201d The search yields \u201cAbout 11,700 results\u201d (in 0.35 seconds) \u2014 apparently from antiwar sources, a brief search suggests. The example is interesting not only in itself, but because of its sharp reversal of the facts. The Iraq War was totally unprovoked: Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld had to struggle hard, even to resort to torture, to try to find some particle of evidence to tie Saddam Hussein to al-Qaeda. The famous disappearing weapons of mass destruction wouldn\u2019t have been a provocation for aggression even if there had been some reason to believe that they existed. In contrast, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was most definitely provoked \u2014 though in today\u2019s climate, it is necessary to add the truism that provocation provides no justification for the invasion. host of high-level U.S. diplomats and policy analysts have been warning Washington for 30 years that it was reckless and needlessly provocative to ignore Russia\u2019s security concerns, particularly its red lines: No NATO membership for Georgia and Ukraine, in Russia\u2019s geostrategic heartland. In full understanding of what it was doing, since 2014, NATO (meaning basically the U.S.), has \u201cprovided significant support [to Ukraine] with equipment, with training, 10s of 1000s of Ukrainian soldiers have been trained, and then when we saw the intelligence indicating a highly likely invasion Allies stepped up last autumn and this winter,\u201d before the invasion, according to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. The U.S. commitment to integrate Ukraine within the NATO command was also stepped up in fall 2021 with the official policy statements we have already discussed \u2014 kept from the bewildered herd by the \u201cfree press,\u201d but surely read carefully by Russian intelligence. Russian intelligence did not have to be informed that \u201cprior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States made no effort to address one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s most often stated top security concerns \u2014 the possibility of Ukraine\u2019s membership into NATO,\u201d as the State Department conceded, with little notice here. Without going into any further details, Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was clearly provoked while the U.S. invasion of Iraq was clearly unprovoked. That is exactly the opposite of standard commentary and reporting. But it is also exactly the norm of wartime propaganda, not just in the U.S., though it is more instructive to observe the process in free societies. Many feel that it is wrong to bring up such matters, even a form of pro-Putin propaganda: we should, rather, focus laser-like on Russia\u2019s ongoing crimes. Contrary to their beliefs, that stand does not help Ukrainians. It harms them. If we are barred, by dictate, from learning about ourselves, we will not be able to develop policies that will benefit others, Ukrainians among them. That seems elementary. Further analysis yields many other instructive examples. We discussed Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Tribe\u2019s praise for President George W. Bush\u2019s decision in 2003 to \u201caid the Iraqi people\u201d by seizing \u201cIraqi funds sitting in American banks\u201d \u2014 and, incidentally, invading and destroying the country, too unimportant to mention. More fully, the funds were seized \u201cto aid the Iraqi people and to compensate victims of terrorism,\u201d for which the Iraqi people bore no responsibility. We didn\u2019t go on to ask how the Iraqi people were to be aided. It is a fair guess that it is not compensation for U.S. pre-invasion \u201cgenocide\u201d in Iraq. \u201cGenocide\u201d is not my term. Rather, it is the term used by the distinguished international diplomats who administered the \u201cOil-for-Food program,\u201d the soft side of President Bill Clinton\u2019s sanctions (technically, via the UN). The first, Denis Halliday, resigned in protest because he regarded the sanctions as \u201cgenocidal.\u201d He was replaced by Hans von Sponeck, who not only resigned in protest with the same charge, but also wrote a very important book providing extensive details of the shocking torture of Iraqis by Clinton\u2019s sanctions,A Different Kind of War. Americans are not entirely protected from such unpleasant revelations. Though von Sponeck\u2019s book was never reviewed, as far as I can determine, it can be purchased from Amazon (for $95) by anyone who has happened to hear about it. And the small publisher that released the English edition was even able to collect two blurbs: from John Pilger and me, suitably remote from the mainstream. There is, of course, a flood of commentary about \u201cgenocide.\u201d By the standards used, the U.S. and its allies are guilty of the charge over and over, but voluntary censorship prevents any acknowledgment of this, just as it protects Americans from international Gallup polls showing that the U.S. is regarded as by far the greatest threat to world peace, or that world public opinion overwhelmingly opposed the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan (also \u201cunprovoked,\u201d if we pay attention), and other improper information. I don\u2019t think there are \u201csignificant lies\u201d in war reporting. The U.S. media are generally doing a highly creditable job in reporting Russian crimes in Ukraine. That\u2019s valuable, just as it\u2019s valuable that international investigations are underway in preparation for possible war crimes trials. That pattern is also normal. We are very scrupulous in unearthing details about crimes of others. There are, to be sure, sometimes fabrications, sometimes reaching the level of comedy, matters that the late Edward Herman and I documented in extensive detail. But when enemy crimes can be observed directly, on the ground, journalists typically do a fine job reporting and exposing them. And they are explored further in scholarship and extensive investigations. As we\u2019ve discussed, on the very rare occasions when U.S. crimes are so blatant that they can\u2019t be dismissed or ignored, they may also be reported, but in such a way as to conceal the far greater crimes to which they are a small footnote. The My Lai massacre, for example. On Ukraine winning the information war, the qualification \u201cin the West\u201d is accurate. The U.S. has always been enthusiastic and rigorous in exposing crimes of its enemies, and in the current case, Europe is going along. But outside of U.S.-Europe, the picture is more ambiguous. In the Global South, the home of most of the world\u2019s population, the invasion is denounced but the U.S. propaganda framework is not uncritically adopted, a fact that has led to considerable puzzlement here as to why they are \u201cout of step.\u201d That\u2019s quite normal too. The traditional victims of brutal violence and repression often see the world rather differently from those who are used to holding the whip. Even in Australia, there\u2019s a measure of insubordination. In the international affairs journalArena, editor Simon Cooper reviews and deplores the rigid censorship and intolerance of even mild dissent in U.S. liberal media. He concludes, reasonably enough, that, \u201cThis means it is almost impossible within mainstream opinion to simultaneously acknowledge Putin\u2019s insupportable actionsandforge a path out of the war that does not involve escalation, and the further destruction of Ukraine.\u201d No help to suffering Ukrainians, of course. That\u2019s also nothing new. That has been a dominant pattern for a long time, notably during World War I. There were a few who didn\u2019t simply conform to the orthodoxy established after Wilson joined the war. The country\u2019s leading labor leader, Eugene Debs, was jailed for daring to suggest to workers that they should think for themselves. He was so detested by the liberal Wilson administration that he was excluded from Wilson\u2019s postwar amnesty. In the liberal Deweyite intellectual circles, there were also some who were disobedient. The most famous was Randolph Bourne. He was not imprisoned but was barred from liberal journals so that he could not spread his subversive message that \u201cwar is the health of the state.\u201d I should mention that a few years later, much to his credit, Dewey himself sharply reversed his stand. It is understandable that liberals should be particularly excited when there is an opportunity to condemn enemy crimes. For once, they are on the side of power. The crimes are real, and they can march in the parade that is rightly condemning them and be praised for their (quite proper) conformity. That is very tempting for those who sometimes, even if timidly, condemn crimes for which we share responsibility and are therefore castigated for adherence to elementary moral principles."

    "output": "Hard to say. Particularly hard for me to say because I avoid social media and only have limited information. My impression is that it is a mixed story. Social media provide opportunities to hear a variety of perspectives and analyses, and to find information that is often unavailable in the mainstream. On the other hand, it is not clear how well these opportunities are exploited. There has been a good deal of commentary \u2014 confirmed by my own limited experience \u2014 arguing that many tend to gravitate to self-reinforcing bubbles, hearing little beyond their own beliefs and attitudes, and worse, entrenching these more firmly and in more intense and extreme forms. That aside, the basic news sources remain pretty much as they were: the mainstream press, which has reporters and bureaus on the ground. The internet offers opportunities to sample a much wider range of such media, but my impression, again, is that these opportunities are little used. One harmful consequence of the rapid proliferation of social media is the sharp decline of mainstream media. Not long ago, there were many fine local media in the U.S. Mostly gone. Few even have Washington bureaus, let alone elsewhere, as many did not long ago. During Ronald Reagan\u2019s Central America wars, which reached extremes of sadism, some of the finest reporting was done by reporters of theBoston Globe, some close personal friends. That has all virtually disappeared. The basic reason is advertiser reliance, one of the curses of the capitalist system. The founding fathers had a different vision. They favored a truly independent press and fostered it. The Post Office was largely established for this purpose, providing cheap access to an independent press. In keeping with the fact that it is to an unusual extent a business-run society, the U.S. is also unusual in that it has virtually no public media: nothing like theBBC,for example. Efforts to develop public service media \u2014 first in radio, later in TV \u2014 were beaten back by intense business lobbying. There\u2019s excellent scholarly work on this topic, which extends also to serious activist initiatives to overcome these serious infringements on democracy, particularly by Robert McChesney and Victor Pickard."

    "output": "Unfortunately, Edward \u2014 the prime author \u2014 is no longer with us. Sorely missed. I think he would agree with me that the digital age hasn\u2019t changed much, beyond what I just described. What survives of mainstream media in a largely business-run society still remains the main source of information and is subject to the same kinds of pressures as before. There have been important changes apart from what I briefly mentioned. Much like other institutions, even including the corporate sector, the media have been influenced by the civilizing effects of the popular movements of the \u201860s and their aftermath. It is quite illuminating to see what passed for appropriate commentary and reporting in earlier years. Many journalists have themselves gone through these liberating experiences. Naturally, there is a huge backlash, including passionate denunciations of \u201cwoke\u201d culture that recognizes that there are human beings with rights apart from white Christian males. Since Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern strategy,\u201d the GOP leadership has understood that since they cannot possibly win votes on their economic policies of service to great wealth and corporate power, they must try to direct attention to \u201ccultural issues\u201d: the false idea of a \u201cGreat Replacement,\u201d or guns, or indeed anything to obscure the fact that we\u2019re working hard to stab you in the back. Donald Trump was a master of this technique, sometimes called the \u201cthief, thief\u201d technique: when you\u2019re caught with your hand in someone\u2019s pocket, shout \u201cthief, thief\u201d and point somewhere else.

    "output": "Here again there\u2019s a long history. In the early postwar period [World War II], independent thought could be silenced by charges of comsymp: you\u2019re an apologist for Stalin\u2019s crimes. It\u2019s sometimes condemned as McCarthyism, but that was only the vulgar tip of the iceberg. What is now denounced as \u201ccancel culture\u201d was rampant and remained so. That technique lost some of its power as the country began to awaken from dogmatic slumber in the \u201860s. In the early \u201880s, Jeane Kirkpatrick, a major Reaganite foreign policy intellectual, devised another technique: moral equivalence. If you reveal and criticize the atrocities that she was supporting in the Reagan administration, you\u2019re guilty of \u201cmoral equivalence.\u201d You\u2019re claiming that Reagan is no different than Stalin or Hitler. That served for a time to subdue dissent from the party line. Whataboutism is a new variant, hardly different from its predecessors. For the true totalitarian mentality, none of this is enough. GOP leaders are working hard to cleanse the schools of anything that is \u201cdivisive\u201d or that causes \u201cdiscomfort.\u201d That includes virtually all of history apart from patriotic slogans approved by Trump\u2019s 1776 Commission, or whatever will be devised by GOP leaders when they take command and are in a position to impose stricter discipline. We see many signs of it today, and there\u2019s every reason to expect more to come. It\u2019s important to remember how rigid doctrinal controls have been in the U.S. \u2014 perhaps a reflection of the fact that it is a very free society by comparative standards, hence posing problems to the doctrinal managers, who must be ever alert to signs of deviation. By now, after many years, it\u2019s possible to utter the word \u201csocialist,\u201d meaning moderately social democrat. In that respect, the U.S. has finally broken out of the company of totalitarian dictatorships. Go back 60 years and even the words \u201ccapitalism\u201d and \u201cimperialism\u201d were too radical to voice. Students for a Democratic Society President Paul Potter, in 1965, summoned the courage to \u201cname the system\u201d in his presidential address, but couldn\u2019t manage to produce the words. There were some breakthroughs in the \u201860s, a matter of deep concern to American liberals, who warned of a \u201ccrisis of democracy\u201d as too many sectors of the population tried to enter the political arena to defend their rights. They counseled more \u201cmoderation in democracy,\u201d a return to passivity and obedience, and they condemned the institutions responsible for \u201cindoctrination of the young\u201d for failing to perform their duties. The doors have been opened more widely since, which only calls for more urgent measures to impose discipline. If GOP authoritarians are able to destroy democracy sufficiently to establish permanent rule by a white supremacist Christian nationalist caste subservient to extreme wealth and private power, we are likely to enjoy the antics of such figures as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who banned 40 percent of children\u2019s math texts in Florida because of \u201creferences to Critical Race Theory (CRT), inclusions of Common Core, and the unsolicited addition of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) in mathematics,\u201d according to the official directive. Under pressure, the State released some terrifying examples, such as an educational objective that, \u201cStudents build proficiency with social awareness as they practice with empathizing with classmates.\u201d If the country as a whole ascends to the heights of GOP aspirations, it will be unnecessary to resort to such devices as \u201cmoral equivalence\u201d and \u201cwhataboutism\u201d to stifle independent thought."

That\u2019s fairly evident to anyone who was able to visit him (I was, once) and was confirmed by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture [and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment] Nils Melzer in May 2019. few days later, Assange was indicted by the Trump administration under the Espionage Act of 1917, the same act that President Wilson employed to imprison Eugene Debs (among other state crimes committed using the Act). Legalistic shenanigans aside, the basic reasons for the torture and indictment of Assange are that he committed a cardinal sin: he released to the public information about U.S. crimes that the government, of course, would prefer to see concealed. That is particularly offensive to authoritarian extremists like Trump and Mike Pompeo, who initiated the proceedings under the Espionage Act. Their concerns are understandable. They were explained years ago by the Professor of the Science of Government at Harvard, Samuel Huntington. He observed that, \u201cPower remains strong when it remains in the dark; exposed to the sunlight it begins to evaporate.\u201d That is a crucial principle of statecraft. It extends to private power as well. That is why manufacture/engineering of consent is a prime concern of systems of power, state and private. This is no novel insight. In one of the first works in what is now called political science, 350 years ago, his \u201cFirst Principles of Government,\u201d David Hume wrote that, Nothing appears more surprising to those, who consider human affairs with a philosophical eye, than the easiness with which the many are governed by the few; and the implicit submission, with which men resign their own sentiments and passions to those of their rulers. When we enquire by what means this wonder is effected, we shall find, that, as Force is always on the side of the governed, the governors have nothing to support them but opinion. It is therefore, on opinion only that government is founded; and this maxim extends to the most despotic and most military governments, as well as to the most free and most popular. Force is indeed on the side of the governed, particularly in the more free societies. And they\u2019d better not realize it, or the structures of illegitimate authority will crumble, state and private. These ideas have been developed over the years, importantly by Antonio Gramsci. The Mussolini dictatorship understood well the threat he posed. When he was imprisoned, the prosecutor announced that, \u201cWe must prevent this brain from functioning for 20 years.\u201d We have advanced considerably since fascist Italy. The Trump-Pompeo indictment seeks to silence Assange for 175 years, and the U.S. and U.K. governments have already imposed years of torture on the criminal who dared to expose power to the sunlight."

    "input": "So take it from there. Which\u2013I think we can start with the assumption we have to be concerned about a dystopian future. Which model do you see emerging?",
    "output": "Actually, I could add a third one. The first of this series of dystopian novels was Zamyatin, his bookWe, around 1920, Russian, gave a very vivid picture of a dystopian society that kind of amalgamates the kinds of pictures that Huxley and Orwell were developing. But we are very clearly moving to a tight surveillance society. There\u2019s interesting work on this: Shoshana Zuboff, whose work you\u2019ve probably seen, a Harvard professor, has a book called, I think,Surveillance Capitalism, which is about the techniques that are being developed to influence, control behavior, control people through the use of modern technology. So as I\u2019m sure you know, when you drive a car, the car is picking up a ton of information about you, going back to the auto maker to some central source, we don\u2019t know exactly where. And so if you\u2019re driving down the main street in Tucson, where we are now, and the information that\u2019s been collected indicates that you like Chinese restaurants, then if you\u2019ve got the right kind of gadgets in your car there\u2019ll be an ad saying, you know, a half-mile from here there\u2019s a Chinese restaurant you might like. And this is not just being used to flood you with information, but also to control you. So, for example, the insurance companies are observing what you\u2019re doing, if you\u2019ve got your car wired up right. And if they see you go through a traffic light, they can send you an instant message saying you better be careful or you\u2019re going to raise your insurance rates. They can even get to the point of locking your car, you know. But there\u2019s a combination of sort of punishment and shaping, trying to direct you in certain directions. You see it every time you look something up on Google, you know; then you get a bunch of things saying you\u2019d like this, or wanted to do this, and so on. All of this goes, is moving on to controlling people at work. So by now, there\u2019s the beginning\u2013actually it began in Sweden, but it\u2019s now expanded here\u2013of placing chips in working people with an inducement. If you agree to have a chip inserted then you get, you know, free access to the coffee machine, and you can do all these interesting things, so people do it. But it also controls your actions. Like if you\u2019re in an Amazon warehouse, they already have systems\u2013which is backbreaking work\u2013they\u2019ve worked out the quickest routes between this spot and that spot. And if you\u2019re one of these people racing to try to keep up with a schedule, and you deviate from the route, you get a discredit immediately. You get an instant warning if you take off a little time to say hello to a friend, you get a warning. UPS is using it to control truck drivers. So if you back up when you shouldn\u2019t have, you get a warning. If you stop for a cup of coffee when that wasn\u2019t on your schedule, you get a warning. They\u2019ve, in fact, they claim they\u2019ve increased efficiency; these people internalize all this, and you race to keep to the commands, and they can claim they can now have more deliveries with fewer drivers, and so on. This is being\u2013the kind of model towards which society is moving is already illustrated to a substantial extent in China, where they have very heavy surveillance systems\u2013cameras, you know, the devices that keep track of you, and so on. And you get a\u2013they have what they call a credit system, social credit system. You get a certain number of points, and if you, say, jaywalk, violate a traffic rule, you lose points. If you help an old lady across the street, you gain points. Pretty soon all this gets internalized, and your life is dedicated to making sure you follow the rules that are established. This is going to expand enormously as we move to what\u2019s called the internet of things. Meaning every device around you\u2013your refrigerator, your toothbrush, and so on\u2013is picking up information about what you\u2019re doing, predicting what you\u2019re going to do next, trying to control what you\u2019re going to do next, advise what you do next. And in a way, Huxley was kind of right. People may not see it as intrusive; they just see it as that\u2019s the way life is, the way the sun rises in the morning. RS:Well, go further than that: they define freedom as consumer sovereignty. And they think of having choices about shoes to buy or the best bargain\u2013that\u2019s what Amazon specializes in\u2013is a very shriveled notion of freedom. Because if you actually think of political freedom, or social activism, or being involved in the moral life of your community, then you will be a little wary of this information being out there. But I just want to make one point about this. What Edward Snowden revealed more than anyone else\u2013and something I think you would be very familiar with, being at the sort of center of a lot of this technology at MIT for so many years\u2013there\u2019s a close connection between what the private sector can get and what the government has. And Snowden\u2019s great revelation was that there\u2019s no wall between Google and Amazon and the government. In fact, we now know Amazon is developing the cloud to keep all this information for the government, for the CIA, for the intelligence agencies. So getting back to these dystopian models, we actually have the situation where people, in the manner of Huxley, give up their information because they\u2019re taking the drug, consumerism, or whatever it is. But we also have the Orwellian image of Big Brother knowing everything, because we know the NSA and the CIA and every other agency has gotten all this information from Google. And so the question I want to put to you, is this the end of time for our species? And is this a reflection\u2013and I know this is going to sound alarmist, but I reread your book,Hegemony or Survival, which was I think 2003. So by the standard of the internet, it was very early. And you mentioned there that the typical life of a species is 100,000 years. That\u2019s one thing I got from it. And that we may be coming to the end of this disfavor, of however it happens. And secondly, it\u2019s an open question whether being smart, as we define smart, is an important way of averting disaster and preventing the disintegration of the species."

    "instruction": "Respond as a Journalist in a Radio Show discussing Bioethics",
    "input": "And you leave it as an open question. The reason it\u2019s a relevant question right at this moment is because we had the best and the brightest, as David Halberstam had described them, who gave us the Cold War and gave us Vietnam and gave us Iraq and everything else and, you know, gave away the money from Main Street to Wall Street, and all that. And now we have somebody who people like to think of as very crude, boorish, ill-mannered, which is Donald Trump. And we have Trumpwashing. Suddenly the smart, liberal people who created much of this mischief are now whitewashed, or Trumpwashed, by this buffoon. So I would like to ask you, first of all, are we in the end of times in that sense? And what is this battle, as I will define it, between Clintonism and Trumpism?",
    "output": "[omission 13:19 \u2013 13:52] Well, you raise a lot of points. I should say there\u2019s a kind of a subtle structure to the book that you mentioned, which may be too subtle for anyone to notice. It begins, the book begins with the discussion by the great biologist Ernst Mayr, who pointed out that\u2013he did mention that the average life of a species\u2013it\u2019s been tens of billions of species\u2013is about 100,000 years; that\u2019s not far from us, we\u2019re maybe 200,000 years. But the point he was making is that intelligence seems to be a kind of lethal mutation. If you look through the\u2013what\u2019s called biological success, what allows the species to survive and proliferate, turns out as you move up the scale of what we call intelligence, capacity to survive declines. So the species that are really very successful are beetles, for example, which have a fixed niche; they never change. Everything changes, the whole world changes, but they stick to their niche and keep reproducing and they\u2019re fine. In fact Julian Huxley, Aldous\u2019s brother, who was a great biologist, was asked once what biology had taught him about God. And he said what he had [been] taught was that God loves beetles. Because there\u2019s a huge number of species that are all over the place, they do great. Another species that does fine is bacteria, the dumbest of all, but they mutate very quickly. So they adapt to whatever comes along. As you move up to, say, mammals\u2013say bigger mammals\u2013their capacity to survive declines. What about when you get to humans? Well, you could argue that\u2013and this is, let me just say at the very end of the same book, there\u2019s a quote from Russell. Russell is asked, when will there be peace on earth? And he says, there will be peace on earth after all higher organisms have disappeared, and we\u2019re back to the bacteria, and so on; then, there will be peace. That\u2019s basically the structure. Now, if you think about it, we\u2019ve been around for a couple hundred thousand years, we\u2019re supposed to be the most intelligent species\u2013we are now proving Mayr\u2019s thesis. Not so much for the reasons you mentioned, which are bad enough, but we are racing to destroy the possibility of organized human life. And it\u2019s a cooperation of those who call themselves the best and the brightest, and the Trumpian boors, and\u2013all doing it. So I\u2019m sure the CEOs of ExxonMobil and JPMorgan Chase know as much about global warming as we do. But they are\u2013and they know, certainly, that continuing to do what they do\u2013maximize the use of fossil fuels, pour money from the banks into development of fossil fuels\u2013they know for certain that that\u2019s going to destroy the possibilities of organized human life, not in the very distant future. Go to the other end, Trump cares about nothing but himself. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another idea in his mind, just me. What is he doing? Well, he\u2019s following what\u2019s good for me: keep his main constituency happy, the rich and the powerful, and somehow control the others. And one way to do it is by saying, let\u2019s maximize the use of fossil fuels. Let\u2019s use more coal, let\u2019s use more energy, let\u2019s be the greatest country in the world. We now are again the major producer of fossil\u2013of oil, surpassing Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s wonderful, let\u2019s all cheer."

In fact, he\u2019s appealed to the government of Ireland to allow him to build a wall\u2013you know, he loves walls\u2013to protect his golf course in Ireland from rising sea levels. His administration came out with one of the most amazing documents in human history. The transportation administration came out with a long, I think, several hundred page environmental assessment study, which predicted that by the end of the century, temperatures will have risen seven degrees Fahrenheit. That\u2019s what climate scientists describe as cataclysmic, about twice the level at which organized human society can survive. And they drew a conclusion from that. The conclusion is we should not put any more emissions controls on automobiles and trucks. Why? Sound argument. We\u2019re going over the cliff anyway, so why not have fun?",
    "output": "So here you have the spectrum, all racing toward disaster, perfectly consciously, a great testimonial to human intelligence. And that\u2019s only the beginning. There\u2019s something else, which\u2013at least this, some people are talking about\u2013there\u2019s another danger, at least as extreme, which is barely discussed. And that\u2019s the greatly increasing threat of nuclear war. Greatly increasing. Not only the nuclear\u2013the new nuclear strategy study, which is bad enough; Obama\u2019s before it was also pretty awful. But also the dismantling of the entire arms control system which has kept us, more or less, barely alive. Anyone who looks at the history of the nuclear weapons period knows that it\u2019s kind of a miracle that we\u2019ve survived this long. Well, there was an arms control regime. One core part of it was the ABM Treaty, which George W. Bush dismantled. The second major part was the INF Treaty, negotiated by Reagan and Gorbachev, that reduced sharply the threat of nuclear war for 20 years. Trump has just abandoned it, and there\u2019s barely a word about it. And furthermore, immediately after abandoning it, the Pentagon carried out a test, obviously long-planned, of a missile that violates the treaty. Just pleading with the Russians and others, please make up, develop missiles to destroy us. The Open Skies treaty, initiated by Eisenhower\u2013it was a different world then\u2013that\u2019s the next one on the chopping block, won\u2019t do that. The New START treaty is next; the administration\u2019s already said they\u2019re not going to sign it. That ends the arms control regime; we are now free to create more and more destructive weapons to ensure that others do the same. If you read the announcements from Lockheed Martin and other arms control producers, they\u2019re ecstatic, getting huge contracts to figure out ways to destroy us all and to make sure that others do it, too. Hardly a word said about this. This is intelligence across the board, OK. So maybe Ernst Mayr is right, and human beings will demonstrate that [it\u2019s] untrue that it\u2019s better to be smart than stupid. We\u2019re supposed to be smart; look at what we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s quite apart from the systems and surveillance and control that you\u2019re talking about. These are the major issues in all of human history. There\u2019s never been a moment in human history when we had to make a decision whether the species is going to survive in any recognizable form. And other species with it; we\u2019re now destroying species at a rate that\u2019s never been seen before. In fact we\u2019re getting to the point, if you look at the temperature rise and the percentage of CO2 particles in the atmosphere, we\u2019re going back to periods hundreds of thousands or even millions of years ago, when the sea level might have been 25 or 30 feet higher. What does that tell you about human life? What are we doing about it? Maximizing the effort, with the United States in the lead. Every other country in the world is trying to do at least something; the United States alone has pulled out of even the weak Paris agreement, and is now dedicated to maximizing these twin disasters. Other countries are bad enough, but we\u2019re in the lead\u2013the most powerful, richest country in history. This is something\u2013there are no words to describe this. RS:Well, this is exactly what caused Bertrand Russell to be considered controversial, and then smeared, when he pointed out the obvious: that the mutual assured destruction strategy of nuclear warfighting\u2013in fact, he used the example not so much of the beetles, but of the survival of the cockroaches, another dumb species. That if you had this great policy that came out of very enlightened administrations, mutual assured destruction, all-out nuclear war and so forth, that it would be the cockroaches and the beetles that survived. And intelligence came into it as a way of more effectively rationalizing, or to use a word you\u2019ve written a lot about, propagandize the public. It\u2019s very skilled. So we argued, our best and brightest, for example, as\u2013and it\u2019s interesting, we\u2019re doing this recording on a day when the Washington Post revealed that they had gotten through the Freedom of Information Act, basically, the Pentagon Papers of the Afghan war. That this war has been a lie, just as the Vietnam War was a lie. We didn\u2019t, we\u2019re not doing it for any of the reasons that were shared with the public. That basically, you know, lives were squandered, and resources, for no purpose. And as we know, in Vietnam, the ignominious loss of the Vietnam War by the U.S.\u2013they always said \u201cyou can\u2019t just get out\u201d\u2013when we lost in the most ignominious defeat, communist China and communist Vietnam went to war, and it did not increase the security threat to the United States. So the best and the brightest\u2013and that\u2019s why Halberstam used that title\u2013used their intelligence to lie more effectively, to propagandize and so forth, and to tell the public stuff they knew was untrue. In fact the Secretary of State under Trump, who is now seen as a good guy, was the head of Exxon, Tillerson. And he could just\u2013he wanted to be a more effective liar. It\u2019s not that he was going to really do anything about global warming. So my point, really, is this is distinction without a difference between so-called liberals and conservatives. I mean, you have the Democratic Party, now is basically a warmongering party. They want to be even tougher. Instead of saying\u2013for instance, it was Ronald Reagan who was quite a warmonger, but nonetheless he made the agreement with Gorbachev. It was Ronald Reagan who said that at Reykjav\u00edk in Iceland: we can step back. You know, after calling them monsters\u2013oh no, we can. We can do some of this. And in fact now, for all kinds of irrelevant reasons, we want to have a new Cold War with Russia, we want to have red-baiting without reds. It\u2019s an exercise in madness. We\u2019ve given up any idea of arms control. And ironically, Trump actually from time to time makes more sensible comments about getting along with some of these people. And at the core of it is something you have written about effectively. It\u2019s the notion\u2013I don\u2019t know if you use that word\u2013of American innocence, American exceptionalism. And you know, this global warming started when, way back when you were writing and we were\u2013they used to say 6% of the world\u2019s population using 60% of its resources. And the waste that was built into the advertising society, and so forth. And it just\u2013I think if I were to take your wisdom in a nutshell, it would be: beware of the people of power, and avarice, and wealth. Because the more intelligent they are, the better they\u2019ll be at distorting reality and convincing us that what\u2019s good for them is good for the world when it\u2019s just the opposite. Well, you raise a great number of points. [Laughs] Be good to go after them point by point. But let\u2019s start for a minute with the Pentagon Papers. The way the Pentagon Papers is interpreted, almost universally, is exactly the way you interpreted it. The Pentagon\u2013I remember an article by Hannah Arendt in the New York Review, calling Washington \u201ccity of lies\u201d\u2013the Pentagon Papers showed they were lying to us. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the Pentagon Papers showed. The focus of discussion about the Pentagon Papers is almost entirely on the 1960s. If you look at The New York Times selection from it, it\u2019s the 1960s. And yes, there was a lot of distortion and deceit, and self-deceit and so on in the sixties. But the Pentagon Papers go back to the 1940s. And if you look back at the early part\u2013which I did writing about it at the time, in fact\u2013you see a rational picture. And in fact if you look at that picture, the idea that the U.S. failed in Vietnam becomes much muddier. Why did we get into Vietnam? Well, you look back around 1950. A major\u2013in the late forties, the United States was kind of ambivalent about how to deal with the imperial systems. On the one hand, it wanted to support its allies\u2013actually clients, by that time\u2013Britain, France, Holland, and so on, which would have meant supporting their imperial systems. On the other hand, the United States was dedicated to what it called an open world in which U.S. multinationals, which were just developing at the time, would be free to exploit, to gain resources, to invest without any impediments. So no closed regions, all open regions, which we would expect to dominate. That meant opposing the imperial systems. So there\u2019s a quandary. And different decisions were made in different cases, by thinking about what the best way to do it was. When we got to Vietnam, this was right after what\u2019s called the fall of China. The loss of China, a very interesting term; the assumption is we own it, we lost it. That was a huge event that led to McCarthyism and so on. At that point, U.S. policy toward Vietnam changed. Before that, it had been ambivalent. But the decision was made to support France in its effort to reconquer its former colony. And there was a reason. It\u2019s the reason that underlies, that runs all through history. It\u2019s ridiculed as the domino theory, but though it\u2019s ridiculed, it\u2019s never abandoned, because it\u2019s correct. So therefore you go back to it, time after time. The idea was put nicely by Henry Kissinger: when there\u2019s a virus that spreads contagion\u2013the virus is independent development, out of control of the United States. If that spreads contagion to others, we\u2019re in trouble. Others will follow the same rule; the system of domination and control will erode. How do you deal with a virus that\u2019s spreading contagion? Well, you kill the virus and inoculate the victims so they won\u2019t be infected. That\u2019s exactly what was done in Vietnam. Vietnam was smashed. It\u2019s not going to be a model to anybody. Surrounding countries were inoculated by imposing vicious, brutal military dictatorships. No infection there; they\u2019re going to be controlled. And it worked. In fact, the telling point was Indonesia. They didn\u2019t care much about Vietnam, but Indonesia they did care about; very rich in resources and so on. When Suharto took [power] in 1965, that was just killing hundreds of thousands of people, instituting a vicious regime of torture and murder, all described pretty accurately, with euphoria. It was a \u201cgleam of light in Asia,\u201d as the Times\u2019 liberal correspondent James Reston described. You know, hope where there was none, and so on. Why? Because it ended the threat of contagion. In fact, in later years McGeorge Bundy, who was national security adviser for Kennedy and Johnson, he reflected that they probably should have ended the war in 1965, the Vietnam War. Because it had already been won. Vietnam was already smashed. The surrounding countries were now safe. And what they were really worried about in 1950 was Japan. The Asia historian John Dower, famous Asia historian, called Japan the superdomino. They were concerned that if Indonesia and Burma and Thailand accommodated to move in a path of independence, Japan might join this system as its industrial commercial center, and they would be, the rest of Southeast, East Asia would be the surrounding resource area. What\u2019s that? That\u2019s what Japan tried to construct during World War II. That\u2019s the new order in Asia. In 1950, U.S. planners were not ready to lose the Pacific War. This was disgraceful, but rational planning. And if you think about the consequences, it pretty much worked. Now, you look at Afghanistan, the papers that came out this morning\u2013notice what they\u2019re focused on. Incompetence. Stupid decisions. We didn\u2019t know what we were doing, and so on. You go back to, take Russia in the early 1980s. If we had internal documents from Russia in the early eighties, I\u2019m sure we would find the generals, political analysts saying what we\u2019re doing in Afghanistan is incompetent. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s a mistake, we should do it differently, and so on. Is that the problem with the Russian invasion of Afghanistan? No. Is it the problem with the American destruction of Indochina, that there were lies and it was incompetent? No. All of this is deep-seated propaganda, internalized. We\u2019re looking at the wrong thing, because that supports American innocence. If you say we were stupid, we made mistakes, and so on\u2013well, we can still be the most idealistic, wonderful place in the world; anybody can make mistakes. If you look at the actual planning, and the reasoning\u2013which was not silly, and in fact is duplicated over and over. The comment I quoted from Kissinger was about Allende. He said Chilean social democracy is a virus that might spread contagion. How is it dealt with? By installing the Pinochet dictatorship to kill it at its heart, to kill the virus. Installing brutal, vicious military dictatorships throughout the entire region. That\u2019s pretty much duplicating the same reasoning. And you can give case after case. And it goes back way before in the history of imperialism; you go back to King George the Third, time of the American Revolution. His concern was that this rise of republicanism in the British colonies could be a virus that would lead to a call for republicanism elsewhere, and the whole British Empire would erode. This is standard imperial history. We\u2019re right in the middle of it. It\u2019s not American exceptionalism. It\u2019s American conformity to standard imperial history, along with the propaganda of innocence, exceptionalism, and so on. And interestingly, the best and the brightest are accepting the propaganda. That\u2019s what they\u2019re focusing on. Not the rational imperial planning; the implementation of it, which unfortunately is pretty successful. Many millions of people are paying for that. That\u2019s what we should be thinking about. RS:OK, you\u2019re going to have to go, and we\u2019re going to have to tie it up. But I want to get to what we were going to talk about at the beginning, the question of Israel. So I\u2019m going to cut this short. I\u2019m not disagreeing with anything you said. And by the way, the value of the Pentagon Papers was it showed we lied about the very reason for going in, and putting Diem in\u2013 They didn\u2019t lie about it. If you look, about the early years, it\u2019s described accurately. In the sixties, they were lying about it, that\u2019s true. Because they were stuck and didn\u2019t know what to do. RS:OK, but when they had\u2013I don\u2019t want to go through the whole history, but when they had Tom Dooley and the Catholics fleeing, and they presented Vietnam as a totally Catholic\u2013I mean, we can go through the tissue of lies. But I do want to make one point here, I don\u2019t want to drop it, and I think it\u2019s an interesting point. If we think, yes, imperialism is an outmoded model, or it\u2019s a model that\u2019s difficult to defend; it\u2019s not the model that, say, Tim Cook of Apple would favor, or Sergey Brin of Google, or many of the people who have come out of MIT or Stanford or other places. They believe, actually, in a kind of virulent capitalism, including having dominance in particular industries and so forth. And that model\u2013just as communism turned out not to be nationalist, turned out to be highly\u2013I mean, turned out to be highly nationalist, not internationalist. The Vietnamese really cared about Vietnam, and they had their own grievances with China; the Sino-Soviet Dispute was a reality going back to the 1920s. Tito was really the model we should have studied rather than, you know, some notion of communist imperialism, which is a fiction. And in fact, the communists turned out to prove Karl Marx right, which is capitalism was a stage that comes before socialism. It doesn\u2019t replace socialism, and it ends the idiocy of rural life and builds big cities, et cetera, as he said in the manifesto. So the real issue was, was the Cold War necessary? Could we have had American economic dominance and trade and so forth in a more truly open society, where they could do it with one form or another, and one degree or another of state involvement\u2013and China is a perfect example. It\u2019s now very a successful capitalist, state capitalist country, up to the point where it is now; Vietnam is following in that. And so all I\u2019m saying is that they were irrational in trying to hold to an imperialist model at the very time when England and France knew it was not economically viable, and you have to abandon it. So, but leaving that\u2013 I don\u2019t agree with that. England and France were trying to sustain their imperial model. And in fact, the imperial model that was developed was very successful. Suppose that the United States had really, in the forties and fifties, had allowed countries to go their own way. Suppose that they\u2019d said, OK, Vietnam, you want to develop independently, out of our control\u2013fine, go ahead and do it; you\u2019ll be successful. Thailand followed, Burma followed, Indonesia followed; Japan joined in and became the center of this system. Would U.S. multinationals be able to dominate the world? Take a look at today\u2019s world, OK. There\u2019s a kind of a\u2013when we look at national power, what people look at typically is GDP, gross domestic product. And you look at U.S. share of GDP\u2013it\u2019s declined. It was maybe 40% in 1945, then maybe 25% by 1970, maybe 17% today. It looks like a decline. But take another measure. Take a look at the\u2013here I\u2019m quoting very interesting work by a young political economist, Ken Starrs. Suppose you look at the dominance of the economy by U.S.-based multinationals. It\u2019s spectacular. U.S. multinationals control about 50% of the global economy, own\u2013own 50% of it. In just about every area\u2013manufacturing, retail\u2013 RS:That\u2019s my point. My point is it\u2019s a more effective model than sending the troops\u2013 No, this is the imperial model, which succeeded. It prevented other countries from moving toward independent development, and therefore led to a situation in which U.S. multinationals dominate the world. If they had moved to independent development, we\u2019d see exactly what we\u2019re seeing with China today. It\u2019s moving toward independent development; U.S. is trying to prevent it. The policies, shared bipartisan policies, are to try to prevent Chinese [independent] development. So if China, for example\u2013you know, the mantra is \u201cChina\u2019s stealing our jobs.\u201d Is China stealing our jobs? They don\u2019t have a gun to the head of Tim Cook, saying invest here. The U.S. multinationals are losing our jobs. But we don\u2019t want China to develop as an economy. That\u2019s why the bipartisan programs are to prevent China from doing the things that make the economy successful\u2013like industrial policy, to have a state industrial policy. We see that that\u2019s successful; we want them to stop it. Kind of interesting, because that\u2019s\u2013economists and others, if they believe a word they\u2019re saying, ought to be cheering. According to their theories, if the state intervenes in the economy, it\u2019s going to harm the economy. But everyone knows the opposite is true. In fact, we ourselves have a massive state industrial policy. That\u2019s why you have things like computers and the internet and so on, it\u2019s mainly public funding. But we don\u2019t want China to have that, because they\u2019ll be successful, they\u2019ll be out of our control; that we don\u2019t want. That\u2019s what the kind of concern was in the fifties. So I think the imperial model has been very successful. It\u2019s led to a situation in which it\u2019s primarily designed for the benefit of U.S. capital, which has succeeded beyond belief. RS:Well, I think that\u2019s absolutely true. The question is whether in this multinational world\u2013and again, I need to get to these other points\u2013but whether\u2013and we\u2019ll see; this is a real test with the whole argument about holding China back. Because for the individual companies, Apple makes a lot of money from China. China delivers a docile workforce; you know, it\u2019s stable. And so the Chinese so-called communist model has turned out to be much better than if we had conquered China or returned Chiang Kai-shek to power, who controlled it. That\u2019s right. But as soon as it\u2019s beginning to get out of control, there\u2019s a bipartisan agreement, backed by capital, to try to prevent their development. Now on a much smaller scale that happened in Vietnam, happened in Chile. It\u2019s happened over and over again, even happened with Grenada if you want to look at it. And that\u2019s a standard imperial model that goes back way before we picked it up. And overall, it\u2019s been pretty successful. There were things that didn\u2019t work out. But for the main drivers of American policy, which is concentrated capital, it\u2019s been a pretty successful system."

Polychroniou: COP26, touted as our \u201clast best hope\u201d to avert a climatic catastrophe, has produced an outcome that was a \u201ccompromise,\u201d according to United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, while activists conducted a funeral ceremony at the Glasgow Necropolis to symbolize the failure of the summit. Noam, can you give us your analysis of the COP26 climate agreement?",
    "output": "There were two events at Glasgow: within the stately halls, and in the streets. They may have not been quite at war, but the conflict was sharp. Within, the dominant voice mostly echoed the concerns of the largest contingent, corporate lobbyists; rather like the U.S. Congress, where the impact of lobbyists, always significant, has exploded since the 1970s as the corporate-run neoliberal assault against the general population gained force. The voice within had some nice words but little substance. In the streets, tens of thousands of protesters, mostly young, were desperately calling for real steps to save the world from looming catastrophe. The outcome of this conflict will determine the course of history \u2014 or more precisely, will determine whether future human history will be \u201cnasty, brutish and short\u201d (to lift philosopher Thomas Hobbes\u2019s words) or full of promise and opportunity. The conflict is nicely encapsulated in a report of Brazil\u2019s National Institute of Space Research. It is dated October 27, just a few days before COP26 opened, offering space for fine words and eloquent promises about saving the Amazon forests, a precious resource for Brazil\u2019s future, and the world\u2019s. The Institute reported that \u201cthe area deforested in Brazil\u2019s Amazon reached a 15-year high after a 22% jump from the prior year, [an outcome that] flies in the face of [the Jair] Bolsonaro government\u2019s recent attempts to shore up its environmental credibility,\u201d to put it politely. It was put less politely by spokespersons for Brazilian and international environmental organizations. One said, \u201cWe are seeing the Amazon rainforest being destroyed by a government which made environmental destruction its public policy.\u201d Another said: \u201cThis is the real Brazil that the Bolsonaro government tries to hide with fantastical speeches and actions of greenwashing abroad. The reality shows that the Bolsonaro government accelerated the path of Amazon destruction.\u201d Within the halls there were many \u201cfantastical speeches,\u201d while the outside world revealed much that \u201cflies in their face.\u201d Within, there was great enthusiasm about the $130 trillion that will be provided by financial institutions to rescue us. U.S. chief negotiator John Kerry was exultant that the market is now on our side. He might be right, if we understand the phrase \u201cthe market\u201d to refer not to the \u201cfantastical\u201d concept that is conjured up in public discourse but to the real world market: What Robert Pollin and Gerald Epstein call the neoliberal \u201cbailout economy.\u201d How the holy market works in this case is outlined by political economist Adam Tooze. Lending by the holders of the rescue package of $130 trillion \u201cwill not be concessional,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe trillions, Kerry insisted to his Glasgow audience, will earn a proper rate of return. But how then will they flow to low-income countries? After all, if there was a decent chance of making profit by wiring west Africa for solar power, the trillions would already be at work. For that, Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager, has a ready answer. He can direct trillions towards the energy transition in low-income countries, if the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are there to \u2018derisk\u2019 the lending, by absorbing the first loss on projects in Africa, Latin America and Asia. Even more money will flow if there is a carbon price that gives clean energy a competitive advantage.\u201d \u201cIt is a neat solution,\u201d Tooze adds: \u201cThe same neat neoliberal solution that has been proffered repeatedly since the 1990s. The same solution that has not been delivered.\u201d And won\u2019t be delivered unless the friendly taxpayers (excluding the rich, who are granted ways to exempt themselves) perform their neoliberal duty in the \u201cbailout economy.\u201d Others added their own interpretation of the lofty rhetoric within the halls. Not least Washington. \u201cWe must seize this moment,\u201d President Joe Biden declared in Glasgow. On returning home, he \u201copened the largest oil and gas lease sale in U.S. history,\u201d carrying out a program set in motion by former President Donald Trump. In defense, the administration held that it was obligated to proceed because of \u201ca preliminary injunction issued by a federal judge in June, saying that its proposed pause on new leases would be illegal.\u201d Environmental groups point out a variety of options, but the main conclusions stare us in the face: The reigning institutions, whether federal or judicial, are unwilling to take the steps needed to save us from catastrophe. Threats will mount when, as seems likely, the denialist party storms back into power, having successfully blocked government programs that would help the population but bolster their political opposition, along with a flood of lies about saving innocent little children from the \u201ccritical race theory\u201d villains who are teaching them that they are by nature brutal oppressors, and whatever other hysteria they can whip up. As Trump took over sole possession of the Republican Party, the percentage of Republicans who regarded global warming as a \u201cserious problem\u201d declined from 49 percent to 39 percent while, \u201cThe proportion of Democrats who see climate change as an existential threat rose by 11 points to 95 percent over seven years.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to imagine how the wrecker and his minions will gleefully exploit the renewed opportunity to race as quickly as possible toward irreversible tipping points, while enriching their corporate masters. The \u201clast, best hope\u201d in Glasgow was not the conference of 120 world leaders, but the competing event that was taking place in the streets outside. They are the ones who can compel the powerful in government and corporate headquarters to act expeditiously to use the options available to avert the race to destruction and to create a better world."

    "input": "Bob, first what\u2019s your own assessment of the key outcomes from COP26, and what do you make of the position of those countries which were fiercely opposed to calls for the inclusion of fossil fuels in any final agreement and phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies?",
    "output": "Robert Pollin:The first thing to say about the COP26 conference is that it demonstrated, yet again, the breathtaking capacity of high-level diplomats to discuss issues of human survival almost entirely disconnected from reality. For example, it was considered an achievement of the conference that, for the first time, the burning of fossil fuels to produce energy was officially recognized as a cause of climate change. The only way that we can consider this progress is in relationship to the flat-out absurdity that the previous 25 COP agreements had all failed to acknowledge the long-established reality that burning fossil fuels is responsible for producing about 75-80 percent of the greenhouse gases causing climate change. Beyond this measure of \u201cprogress,\u201d the COP26 diplomats still wrangled over whether they objected,full stop, to governments providing fossil fuel subsidies or rather, whether they objected only to fossil fuel subsidies that are \u201cinefficient,\u201d whatever that means. Not surprisingly, the final document ended up only opposing \u201cinefficient\u201d subsidies. Similarly, at the very end of the meetings, China and India managed to substitute a reference to \u201cphasingdown\u201d coal rather than the original text that referred to \u201cphasingout\u201d coal. Amid such word-parsing exercises, the underlying reality is that, even with all the pledges made at the last major COP conference, COP21 in Paris in 2015, almost nothing has been accomplished in terms of reducing CO2 emissions. Thus, in its 2021 \u201cWorld Energy Outlook,\u201d the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that, according to its \u201cstated policies\u201d scenario \u2014 i.e. a scenario that takes account of all government pledges made at Paris along with what they have actually accomplished relative to these pledges \u2014 global CO2 emissions will not fallat allas of 2030 and will fall by less than 6 percent as of 2050, from 36 billion tons of emissions today to 33.9 billion tons as of 2050. This, again, is within the context of the Paris agreements, in which all 196 countries committed to stabilizing the global average temperature at 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.5\u00b0C) above pre-industrial levels. To succeed in stabilizing the global average temperature at 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has established that global CO2 emissions must fall by 45 percent by 2030 and reach zero emissions by 2050. All of this tells us that we will never move on to a viable climate stabilization by relying on the words or pledges agreed to in any such diplomatic documents. The only way to move seriously onto a viable climate stabilization path is through grassroots political organizing that forces governments to take actions that they will otherwise never take. If there was any good news out of COP26, it is that political organizers were in the streets in Glasgow in full force and could not be ignored. Their presence did force some concessions into the final document: About half of the nearly 200 country delegations agreed to cut methane emissions by 30 percent as of 2030. The full body pledged to end deforestation by 2030. The full body also acknowledged \u201cwith deep regret\u201d that the rich countries that are responsible for the climate crisis have not fulfilled their financial pledges to support green transition programs in low-income countries. It remains an open question as to whether this \u201cdeep regret\u201d will lead to serious financing commitments that will actually be met."

    "input": "Why is the transition to clean energy so slow? Is it a question of lack of investments and technological know-how, or something else?",
    "output": "Pollin:By some metrics, the transition to clean energy is proceeding fairly quickly. For example, as of 1985, solar energy provided less than 0.01 percent of the world\u2019s electricity supply. By 2020, that figure is up to 3.3 percent. This is an increase of nearly 3,000 percent in 35 years. Of course, we are starting in 1985 with a miniscule base of solar production. More importantly, the level of solar supply can\u2019t remain stuck in the range of 3 percent of electricity in order to meet the climate goals. It rather needs to be in the range of 60-70 percent as of 2050. major factor that had prevented the expansion of clean renewable energy from expanding more rapidly had been cost. As recently as 2010, the average cost globally of producing a kilowatt of electricity through solar energy was 38 cents. As of 2020, the average cost had fallen to less than 7 cents. Meanwhile, the comparative average cost for fossil-fuel-generated electricity has remained stable over this decade at between 5-15 cents per kilowatt hour. In other words, solar is now fully cost-competitive with fossil fuels, which had not been true previously. Both onshore and offshore wind are also now fully cost-competitive with fossil fuels. As such, when we include energy efficiency investments along with those for renewable energy, the overall result is that this clean energy infrastructure can deliver both a zero emissions economy and lower energy costs. Even with renewable energy costs dropping sharply, several critical issues still remain outstanding. One is the intermittency of solar and wind power supply \u2014 that is, the sun doesn\u2019t shine at night and wind doesn\u2019t blow all day everywhere. So transmission and storage questions do need to be addressed \u2014 for example, how to deliver wind-powered electricity reliably and at low cost from a farm in Western Pennsylvania to the center of Philadelphia? A lot of progress is being made toward resolving these issues. But also keep in mind that we don\u2019t need to solve them completely right now, before we can proceed with the clean energy transition. We aren\u2019t going to eliminate the use of fossil fuels next week, no matter what. We have roughly two decades to develop the transmission and storage technologies that we will need to operate the global economy on 100 percent renewable energy supply. Another challenge with building the renewable energy infrastructure is land use. This is a serious question that has emerged in many places. Where do we site the wind turbines and arrays of solar panels without wrecking neighborhoods or natural environments? Part of the solution is to make as much use as possible of artificial surfaces \u2014 such as putting solar panels on rooftops or building solar canopies in parking lots. Such measures are becoming increasingly viable, with the costs of even residential solar installations now also reaching cost parity with both fossil fuels as well as utility-scale solar farms. A similar pattern is also occurring with offshore wind platforms. Broadly speaking then, the technology, intermittency and land use issues are being addressed effectively despite inadequate levels of government support. Still, we need to find the funds to build this global clean energy infrastructure. That is going to require something like 2.5-3 percent of global GDP per year, i.e., about $2.5 trillion next year, then averaging about $4.5 trillion per year between now and 2050, according to figures in our book,Climate Crisis and the Global Green New Deal. What was clear from COP26 is that government funding at sufficient levels will never be forthcoming without political struggles. This is despite the fact that the 2.5 percent of GDP that is required can be provided readily through some financing combinations that we have discussed previously. For example, converting all existing fossil fuel subsidies into clean energy subsidies, transferring only 5-10 percent of military spending into clean energy investments, or having the major central banks purchasing global green investment bonds. Such bond purchases could be in the range of 2 percent of the bailout injections that the Federal Reserve injected into Wall Street to prevent a financial collapse brought on by the COVID recession. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that people shouldn\u2019t expect international climate summits like COP26 or governments to solve the climate crisis, but at the same time defended the Green New Deal plan. How do we realize the goals of the Green New Deal from below? This is a question addressed to both of you. How was the New Deal realized, or any other step forward in human history? Virtually without exception by dedicated persistent activism. This time will not be different. Elements are there. Thanks in no small part to Bob Pollin\u2019s active engagement, backed by sound analytic work, unions are taking up the cause. That includes the United Mine Workers, proceeding well ahead of coal baron Sen. Joe Manchin, a congressional champion-in-receiving-funding-from-fossil-fuel-industries who is cooperating with rock-solid Republican opposition to steps to reverse the race to destruction. There\u2019s ample precedent for organized labor taking the lead, as it did in bringing the New Deal to fruition. One of the earliest environmental activists was Tony Mazzocchi of the Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union, workers who are the most immediate victims of poisoning the atmosphere. His efforts to form a Labor Party failed, and it\u2019s not easy in the rigidly monopolized U.S. political system, but there are ways to progress even in this domain. There are encouraging signs that labor is reviving from the bitter 40-year neoliberal assault. The mass refusal to return to rotten and dangerous jobs is only one sign. The malaise that is leading to an unprecedented wave of \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d in the white working class can, and must, be overcome and directed to the kind of militant labor action that 90 years ago created a base for social democracy in the U.S. while Europe was descending into fascist horror. third of Americans, overwhelmingly Republicans, don\u2019t even regard global warming (let alone the much broader crisis of environmental destruction) as a \u201cserious problem.\u201d All must come to recognize, soon, that it is not only a serious problem but an urgent one, and that how we deal with it, right now, will determine the fate of human life as well as that of the countless species we are casually destroying. To achieve that essential goal requires major educational and organizational efforts, omitting no sector of the society, including those in thrall of Trump-style malevolence. In Congress, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey have reintroduced a 2019 resolution calling for a comprehensive Green New Deal along the lines of the detailed work of Robert Pollin and his colleagues and, with somewhat different models from economist Jeffrey Sachs, now also backed by the IEA. Local and state-level initiatives are underway. There are major international actions, mostly by the young. That\u2019s the barest sample. There\u2019s lots of work to do. This is not the time for musing on the sidelines. Pollin:We need to be organizing at all levels of society to advance the global Green New Deal project. This means fighting to stop any and all communities and institutions from relying on burning fossil fuels to provide energy and to build a zero-emissions energy infrastructure through investments in both energy efficiency and clean renewables. Note that this is distinct from demanding that institutions divest their ownership shares of fossil fuel stock and bonds. The divestment movement has played a critical role in raising consciousness about the climate crisis. But its effectiveness is limited by the reality that if, say, a university sells its stocks in Exxon-Mobil, those stocks are getting purchased by hedge funds that are happy to buy the stocks at reduced prices. The hedge fund will then continue to earn dividends from their fossil fuel stocks as long as people continue to consume oil, coal and natural gas to meet their energy needs. So the Green New Deal program must start with the project of ending reliance on fossil fuels. And we certainly can\u2019t wait for the next COP conference to settle the matter. We then need to be clear that the case for the Green New Deal is overwhelming, at many levels: It is the way through which we can realistically get to zero emissions by 2050. The investments to build the clean energy infrastructure will be a major engine of new job opportunities, in all regions of the world. My co-workers and I have estimated that clean energy investments at about 2.5 percent of GDP per year would generate, for example, about 4-5 million jobs per year in the U.S. and about 20 million jobs in India. Creating these new jobs will also open opportunities to increase union organizing and raise the pay and benefits associated with these jobs. Building the clean energy infrastructure will also create new possibilities for small-scale public, private and cooperative ownership of renewable energy assets. It will eliminate the largest sources of outdoor air pollution, thus significantly raising public health standards. The Green New Deal must, critically, also be committed to just transition for the workers and communities that are currently dependent on the fossil fuel industry that will need to be phased out. In combination, these various features of the global Green New Deal provide a powerful platform for committed and effective organizing. The diplomats that argued last week over what may constitute \u201cinefficient\u201d fossil fuel subsidies will then be forced into finally seeing the reality before their eyes."

There was no Pentagon involvement in research or teaching, though of course, the Pentagon is interested in anything that comes out from anthropology to zoology. The Koch funding of the cancer research centre at MIT I\u2019m sure involves no interference. The University of Arizona Freedom Centre is different.

    "output": "Russell was jailed during World War I along with the handful of others who dared to oppose that glorious enterprise: Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, Eugene Debs \u2014 who was even excluded from postwar amnesty by the vengeful Woodrow Wilson \u2014 to mention only the most famous. Some were treated more kindly, like Randolph Bourne, merely ostracized and barred from liberal intellectual circles and journals. Russell\u2019s later career had many ugly episodes, including his being declared by the courts to be too free-thinking to be allowed to teach at City College, a flood of vilification from high places because of his opposition to the Vietnam War, scurrilous treatment even after his death. Not all that unusual for those who break ranks, no matter how distinguished their contributions, as Russell\u2019s surely were. The term \u201cintellectual\u201d itself is a strange one. It is not applied to a Nobel laureate who devotes his life to physics, or to the janitor in his building who may have little formal education but deep insight and perceptive understanding of human affairs, history, culture. The term is used, usually, to refer to a category of people with a degree of privilege who are somehow regarded to be the guardians of society\u2019s intellectual and moral values. They are supposed to uphold and articulate those values and call upon others to adhere to them. Within this category there is a small minority who challenge power, authority and received doctrine. It is sometimes held that their responsibility is \u201cto speak truth to power.\u201d I\u2019ve always found that troubling. The powerful typically know the truth quite well. They generally know what they are doing, and don\u2019t need our instructions. They also will not benefit from moral lessons, not because they are necessarily bad people, but because they play a certain institutional role, and if they abandon that role, somebody else will fill it as long as the institutions persist. There is no point instructing CEOs of the fossil fuel industry that their activities are damaging communities and destroying the environment and our climate. They\u2019ve known that for a long time. They also know that if they depart from dedication to profit and concern themselves with the human impact of what they are doing, they\u2019ll be out on the streets and someone will replace them to carry out the institutionally required tasks. There remains a range of options, but it is narrow. It would make a lot more sense to speak truth not to power, but to its victims. If you speak truth to the powerless, it\u2019s possible that it could benefit somebody. It might help people confront the problems in their lives more realistically. It might even help them to act and organize in such ways as to compel the powerful to modify institutions and practices; and, even more significantly, to challenge illegitimate structures of authority and the institutions on which they are realized and thereby expand the scope of freedom and justice. It won\u2019t happen in any other way, and it\u2019s often happened in that way in the past. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right either. The task of a responsible person \u2014 anyone who wants to uphold intellectual and moral values \u2014 is not to speak what they regard as truthtoanybody \u2014 the powerful or the powerless \u2014 but rather to speakwiththe powerless and to try to learn the truth. That\u2019s always a collective endeavor and wisdom and understanding need not come from any particular turf. But that\u2019s quite rare in the history of intellectuals. Let\u2019s recall that the term \u201cintellectual\u201d came into use in its modern sense with the Dreyfus trial in France in the late 19th century. Today we admire and respect those who stood up for justice in their defense of Dreyfus, but if you look back at that time, they were a persecuted minority. The \u201cimmortals\u201d of the French Academy bitterly condemned these preposterous writers and artists for daring to challenge the august leaders and institutions of the French State. The prominent figure of the Dreyfusards, Emile Zola, had to flee from France. That\u2019s pretty typical. Take almost any society you like and you will find that there is a fringe of critical dissidents and that they are usually subjected to one or another form of punishment. Those I mentioned are no exception. In recent history, in Russian-run Eastern Europe, they could be jailed; if it was in our own domains, in Central or South America, they could be tortured and murdered. In both cases, there was harsh repression of people who are critical of established power. That goes back as far as you like, all the way back to classical Greece. Who was the person who drank the hemlock? It was the person who was \u201ccorrupting\u201d the youth of Athens by asking searching questions that are better hidden away. Take a look at the Biblical record, roughly about the same period. It\u2019s kind of oral history, but in what\u2019s reconstructed from it, there were people who by our standards might be called intellectuals \u2014 people who condemned the king and his crimes, called for mercy for widows and orphans, other subversive acts. How were they treated? They were imprisoned, driven into the desert, reviled. There were intellectuals who were respected, flatterers at the Court. Centuries later, they were called False Prophets, but not at the time. And if you think through history, that pattern is replicated quite consistently. The basic operative principle was captured incisively by McGeorge Bundy, a leading liberal intellectual, noted scholar, former Harvard dean, national security adviser under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, then director of the Ford Foundation. In 1968, when protest against the Vietnam War was peaking, Bundy published an article in the main establishment journalForeign Affairsin which he discussed protest against the war. Much of the protest was legitimate, he conceded: there had in retrospect been some mistakes in managing such a complex effort. But then there was a fringe of \u201cwild men in the wings\u201d who merit only contempt. The wild men actually descended so far as to look into motives. That is, they treated the U.S. political leadership by the standards applied to others, and hence must be excluded from polite company. Bundy\u2019s analysis was in fact the norm among liberal intellectuals. Their publications soberly distinguished the \u201ctechnocratic and policy-oriented intellectuals\u201d from the \u201cvalue-oriented intellectuals.\u201d The former are the good guys, who orchestrate and inform policy, and are duly honored for their constructive work \u2014 the Henry Kissingers, the kind who loyally transmit orders from their half-drunk boss for a massive bombing campaign in Cambodia, \u201canything that flies against anything that moves.\u201d A call for genocide that\u2019s not easy to duplicate in the archival record. The latter are the wild men in the wings who prate about moral value, justice, international law and other sentimentalities. The U.S. isn\u2019t El Salvador. The wild men don\u2019t have their brains blown out by elite battalions armed and trained in Washington, like the six leading Latin American intellectuals, Jesuit priests, whosuffered this fatealong with their housekeeper and her daughter on the eve of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Who even knows their names? Properly, one might argue, since there were many other religious martyrs among the hundreds of thousands slaughtered in Washington\u2019s crusade in Central America in the 1980s, managed with the assistance of technocratic and policy-oriented intellectuals. It is, regrettably, all too easy to continue. I believe it would be of great interest if you talked about the historical context of \u201cThe Responsibility of Intellectuals,\u201d but also if you elaborate on what you mean when you say intellectuals must see events from their historical perspective. The essay was based on a talk given in1966 to a student group at Harvard. It was published in the group\u2019s journal. They\u2019ve probably expunged it since. It was the Harvard Hillel Society. The journal isMosaic.This was a year before Israel\u2019s military victory in 1967, a great gift to the U.S., which led to a sharp re-orientation in U.S.-Israeli policies and major shifts in popular culture and attitudes in the U.S. \u2014 an interesting and important story, but not for here. TheNew York Review of Bookspublished an edited version. Since the talk was at Harvard, it was particularly important to focus on intellectual elites and their special links to government. The Harvard faculty was quite prominent in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Camelot mythology is in considerable part their creation. But as we\u2019ve been discussing, it\u2019s just one phase in a long history of intellectual service to power. It\u2019s still unfolding without fundamental change, though the activism of the \u201860s and its aftermath has substantially changed much of the country, widening the wings in which \u201cwild men\u201d can pursue their value-oriented subversion. This impact has also greatly broadened the historical perspective from which events of the world are perceived. No one today would write a major diplomatic history of the U.S. recounting how after the British yoke was overthrown, the former colonists, in the words of Thomas Bailey, \u201cconcentrated on the task of felling trees and Indians and of rounding out their natural boundaries\u201d \u2014 in \u201cself-defense,\u201d of course. Few in the \u201860s fully grasped the fact that our \u201cforever wars\u201d began in 1783. The horrendous 400-year record of torture of African Americans was also scarcely acknowledged by mainstream academics; more, and worse, is constantly being unearthed. The same is true in other areas. Dedicated and conscientious activism can open many windows for valuable historical perspective to be gained."

Moreover, we live in a much smaller world, and some of the challenges facing us are truly global in nature and scope. In that context, what should be the role of intellectuals and of social movements in a globalized world and with a shared future for humanity?",
    "output": "You\u2019re quite right that we face far greater challenges today than during the Vietnam era. In 1968, when liberal intellectuals were excoriating the value-oriented \u201cwild men,\u201d the leading issue was that \u201cViet-Nam as a cultural and historic entity [was] threatened with extinction [as] the countryside literally dies under the blows of the largest military machine ever unleashed on an area of this size,\u201d the judgment of the most respected Vietnam specialist, military historian Bernard Fall. It is now organized human society worldwide that is \u201cthreatened with extinction\u201d under the blows of environmental destruction, overwhelmingly by the rich, concentrated in the rich countries. That\u2019s apart from the no less ominous and growing threat of nuclear holocaust, being stoked as we speak. We are living in an era of confluence of crises that has no counterpart in human history. For each of these, feasible solutions are known, though time is short. There is no need to waste words on responsibility. Who is undertaking the historic task of addressing these crises? Who carried out the Global Climate Strike on September 24, a desperate attempt to wake up the dithering leaders of global society, and citizens who have been lulled into passivity by elite treachery? We know the answer: the young, the inheritors of our folly. It should be deeply painful to witness the scene at Davos, the annual gathering where the rich and powerful posture in their self-righteousness, and applaud politely when Greta Thunberg instructs them quietly and expertly on the catastrophe they have been blithely creating. Nice little girl. Now go back to school where you belong and leave the serious problems to us, the enlightened political leaders, the soulful corporations working day and night for the common good, the responsible intellectuals. We\u2019ll take care of it, ensuring that the betrayal will be apocalyptic\u2014 as it will be, if we grant them the power to run the world in accord with the principles they have established and implemented. The principles are not obscure. Right now, governments of the world, the U.S. foremost among them, are pressuring oil producers to increase production \u2014 having just been advised in the August IPCC report, by far the direst yet, that catastrophe is looming unless we begin right now to reduce fossil fuel use year by year, effectively phasing them out by mid-century. Petroleum industry journals are euphoric about the discovery of new fields to exploit as demand for oil increases. The business press debates whether the U.S. fracking industry or OPEC is best placed to increase production. Congress is debating a bill that might have slightly slowed the race to destruction. The denialist party is 100 percent opposed, so the fate of legislation is in the hands of the \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrats, particularly Joe Manchin. He has made his position on climate explicit: \u201cSpending on innovation, not elimination.\u201d Straight out of the playbook of PR departments of the fossil fuel companies, no surprise from Congress\u2019s leading recipient of fossil fuel compensation. Fossil fuel use must continue unimpeded, driving us to catastrophe in the interests of short-term profit for the very rich. Period. On the rest of the Biden package, Manchin \u2014 the swing vote \u2014 has made it clear that he will accept only a trickle, also insisting on cumbersome and degrading means testing for what is standard practice in the civilized world. The posture is certainly not for the benefit of his constituents. As for other \u201cmoderates,\u201d it is much the same. Without far more intense public pressure, there was never much hope that this Congress would allow the country to begin to beat back the cruel assault of overwhelming business power. There is no need to tarry on what this entails about responsibility. And again, we dare not neglect the cloud that was cast over the world by human intelligence 75 years ago and has been darkening in recent years. The arms control regime that had been laboriously constructed over many decades has been systematically dismantled by the last two Republican administrations, first Bush II and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, then Trump wielding his wrecking ball with abandon. He left office barely in time for Biden to salvage the New START Treaty, accepting Russia\u2019s pleas to extend it. Biden continues, however, to support the bloated military budget, to pursue the race to develop more dangerous weapons, and to carry out highly provocative acts where diplomacy and negotiations are surely possible. major point of contention right now is \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d in the South China Sea. More accurately, as Australian strategic analyst Clinton Fernandes points out, the conflict concerns military/intelligence operations in China\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) extending 200 miles offshore. The U.S. holds that such operations are permissible in all EEZs. China holds that they are not. India agrees with China\u2019s interpretation, and vigorously protested recent U.S. military operations in its EEZ. EEZs were established by the 1982 Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The U.S. is the only maritime power not to have ratified the Law, but asserts that it will not violate it. The relevant wording about military operations in the Law is not entirely precise. Surely this is a clear case where diplomacy is in order, not highly provocative actions in a region of considerable tension, with the threat of escalation, possibly without bounds. All of this is part of the U.S. effort to \u201ccontain China.\u201d Or, to put it differently, to establish \u201cThe fact that somehow, the rise of 20 per cent of humanity from abject poverty into something approaching a modern state, is illegitimate \u2014 but more than that, by its mere presence, an affront to the United States. It is not that China presents a threat to the United States \u2014 something China has never articulated nor delivered \u2014 rather, its mere presence represents a challenge to United States pre-eminence.\u201d This is the quite realistic assessment of former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, reacting to the recent AUKUS (Australia-U.K.-U.S.) agreement to sell eight advanced nuclear submarines to Australia, to be incorporated in the U.S. naval command in order to respond to the \u201cthreat of China.\u201d The agreement abrogates a France-Australia agreement for sale of conventional subs. With typical imperial arrogance, Washington did not even notify France, instructing the European Union on its place in the U.S.-run global order. In reaction, France recalled its ambassadors to the U.S. and Australia, ignoring the U.K., a mere vassal state. Australian military correspondent Brian Toohey observes that Australia\u2019s submission to the U.S. does not enhance its security \u2014 quite the contrary \u2014 and that AUKUS has no discernable strategic purpose. The subs will not be operational for over a decade, by which time China will surely have expanded its military forces to deal with this new military threat, just as it has done to deal with the fact that it is ringed by nuclear-armed missiles in some of the 800 military bases that the U.S. has around the world (China has one, Djibouti). Toohey outlines the naval military balance that is disrupted further by AUKUS. It\u2019s worth quoting directly to help understand how China threatens the U.S. \u2014 not in the Caribbean or the California coast, but on China\u2019s borders: China\u2019s nuclear weapons are so inferior that it couldn\u2019t be confident of deterring a retaliatory strike from the US. Take the example of nuclear-powered, ballistic missile-armed submarines (SSBNs). China has four Jin-class SSBNs. Each can carry 12 missiles, each with a single warhead. The subs are easy to detect because they\u2019re noisy. According to the US Office of Naval Intelligence, each is noisier than a Soviet submarine first launched in 1976. Russian and US subs are now much quieter. China is expected to acquire another four SSBNs that are a little quieter by 2030. However, the missiles on the subs won\u2019t have the range to reach the continental US from near their base on Hainan island in the South China Sea. To target the continental US, they would have to reach suitable locations in the Pacific Ocean. However, they are effectively bottled up inside the South China Sea. To escape, they have to pass through a series of chokepoints where they would be easily sunk by US hunter killer nuclear submarines of the type the [Australian] Morrison government wants to buy. In contrast, the US has 14 Ohio-class SSBNs. Each can launch 24 Trident missiles, each containing eight independently targetable warheads able to reach anywhere on the globe. This means a single US submarine can destroy 192 cities, or other targets, compared to 12 for the Chinese submarine. The Ohio class is now being replaced by the bigger Columbia class. These [are being] constructed at the same time as new US hunter killer submarines. That\u2019s before eight new advanced nuclear subs are built for Australia. In nuclear forces generally and other relevant military capacity, China is of course far behind the U.S., as are all potential U.S. adversaries combined. AUKUS does serve a purpose, however: to establish more firmly that the U.S. intends to rule the world, even if that requires escalating the threat of war, possibly terminal nuclear war, in a highly volatile region. And eschewing such \u201csissified\u201d measures as diplomacy. It is not the only example. One of these should have been on the front pages in the past few weeks as the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan, executing Trump\u2019s cynical sell-out of Afghans in his February 2020 deal with the Taliban. The obvious question is: Why did the Bush administration invade 20 years ago? The U.S. had no interest in Afghanistan, as Bush\u2019s pronouncements at the time made explicit; the real prize was Iraq, then beyond. Bush also made it clear that the administration also had little interest in Osama bin Laden or al-Qaeda. That lack of concern was made fully explicit by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld when the Taliban offered surrender. \u201cWe do not negotiate surrenders,\u201d Rumsfeld stormed. The only plausible explanation for the invasion was given by the most highly respected leader of the anti-Taliban resistance, Abdul Haq. He was interviewed shortly after the invasion by Asia scholar Anatol Lieven. Haq said that the invasion will kill many Afghans and undermine promising Afghan efforts to undermine the Taliban regime from within, but that\u2019s not Washington\u2019s concern: \u201cthe US is trying to show its muscle, score a victory and scare everyone in the world. They don\u2019t care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many people we will lose.\u201d That also seems a fair description of current U.S. strategy in \u201ccontaining the China threat\u201d by provocative escalation in place of diplomacy. It\u2019s no innovation in imperial history. Returning to the responsibility of intellectuals and how it is being fulfilled, no elaboration should be necessary."

On the current military situation, there are two radically different stories. The familiar one is provided by Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence head, Gen. Kyrylo Budanov: Russia\u2019s attempt to overthrow the Ukrainian government has failed, so Russia is now retreating to the occupied south and east of the country, the Donbas region and the eastern Azov sea coast, planning a \u201cKorean scenario.\u201d The head of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, Col. Gen. Sergey Rudskoy, tells a very different story (as of March 25): a rendition of George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d in Iraq, though without the dramatic trappings: The main goal of the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d was to defend the Donbass People\u2019s Republic from the genocidal assaults of Ukrainian Nazis over the past eight years. Since Ukraine rejected diplomacy, it was necessary to extend the operation to \u201cdemilitarization and denazification\u201d of Ukraine, destroying military targets with great care to spare civilians. The main goals have been efficiently achieved exactly according to plan. What remains is the full \u201cliberation of Donbass.\u201d Two tales, same ending, which I presume is accurate. The West, quite plausibly, adopts the former story. That is, it adopts the story that tells us that Russia is incapable of conquering cities a few miles from its border that are defended by what are limited military forces by world standards, supported by a citizen\u2019s army. Or does the West adopt this story? Its actions indicate that it prefers the version of General Rudskoy: an incredibly powerful and efficient Russian military machine, having quickly achieved its objectives in Ukraine, is now poised to move on to invade Europe, perhaps overwhelming NATO just as efficiently. If so, it is necessary to reinforce NATO\u2019s eastern front to prevent the impending invasion by this monstrous force."

By moving on to criminal aggression, he carried a step forward the annual mobilizations on Ukraine\u2019s borders in an effort to elicit some attention to his unanswered calls to consider Russia\u2019s security concerns, which are recognized as significant by a host of top U.S. diplomats, CIA directors, and numerous others who have warned Washington of the foolishness of ignoring these concerns. Perhaps exploring Putin\u2019s soul is the right approach to understanding his decision in February 2022. There is, perhaps, another possibility. Perhaps he meant what he and all other Russian leaders have been saying since former President Boris Yeltsin, 25 years ago, about neutralization of Ukraine; and perhaps, even though the highly provocative joint statement has been silenced in the U.S., Putin might have paid attention to it and therefore decided to escalate the disregarded annual efforts to direct aggression. possibility, perhaps.

    "output": "It\u2019s not hard to think of cases. One of the most terrifying is Afghanistan. Literally millions of people are facing starvation, a colossal tragedy. There is food in the markets, but lacking access to banks, people with a little money have to watch their children starve. Why? A major reason is that Washington is refusing to release Afghanistan\u2019s funds, kept in New York banks in order to punish poor Afghans for daring to resist Washington\u2019s 20-year war. The official pretexts are even more shameful: The U.S. must withhold the funds from starving Afghans in case Americans want reparations for crimes of 9/11, for which Afghans bear no responsibility. Recall that the Taliban offered complete surrender, which would have meant turning over the al-Qaeda suspects. (They were only suspects at the time of the U.S. invasion, in fact long after as the FBI confirmed.) But the U.S. firmly responded with the edict that, \u201cThe United States is not inclined to negotiate surrenders.\u201d That was Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, echoed by George W. Bush. If there is any moral outrage about this current crime, it\u2019s hard to detect. It is far from the only case. Are there some lessons to be learned? Perhaps, but though they seem simple enough, maybe they merit a few words. Moral outrage over Russian crimes in Ukraine is understandable and justified. The extreme selectivity in moral outrage is also understandable, but not justified. It is understandable because it is so common. It is hard to think of a more elementary moral principle than the Golden Rule \u2014 in the Jewish tradition, the rule that \u201cwhat is hateful to you, do not do to others.\u201d There is no rule that is more elementary, or more consistently violated. That is also true for a corollary: Energy and attention should be focused on where we can do most good. With regard to international affairs, that typically means focusing on the actions of one\u2019s own state, particularly in more or less democratic societies where citizens have some role in determining outcomes. We can deplore crimes in Myanmar [also known as Burma], but we cannot do much to alleviate the suffering and misery within Myanmar. We could do a lot to help the miserable victims who fled or were expelled, the Rohingya in Bangladesh. But we don\u2019t. The observation generalizes. The principle is indeed elementary. To say that actual practice fails to conform to it would be a vast understatement. It is not that we do not understand and honor the principle. We do, with true passion, when the principle is observed in the societies of official enemies: We greatly admire the Russians who are courageously defying the harsh Russian autocracy and protesting the Russian invasion. That keeps to a long tradition. We always greatly honored Soviet dissidents who condemned the crimes of their own state, and never cared at all about what they said about others, even when they applauded major U.S. crimes. Same with Chinese and Iranian dissidents. It is only when the principle applies to ourselves that it can barely even be contemplated. One dramatic illustration among many is the U.S. invasion of Iraq. It can be criticized as a \u201cstrategic blunder\u201d (according to Barack Obama) but not as what it was: unprovoked and murderous aggression, the \u201csupreme international crime\u201d according to the Nuremberg judgment. Accordingly, the dramatic selectivity in moral outrage is understandable, and another outrage. In some weak form of extenuation, we can add that it is no U.S. invention. Our predecessors as hegemonic imperial powers were no different, including Britain; arguably worse, though after centuries of disgraceful behavior there is now some beginning of reckoning. Turning to the next question, does the U.S. ever think that conflicts can be resolved by peaceful means? No doubt. There are examples, which deserve a closer look. We can learn a lot from them about international affairs, if we choose. Right at this moment, we are all called upon to celebrate a remarkable example of U.S. initiative to resolve conflict by peaceful means: the ongoing \u201cNegev Summit\u201d of Israel and four Arab dictatorships, which will \u201cexpand the potential for peace and conflict resolution across the region,\u201d according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Washington\u2019s representative at the historic meeting. The summit brings together the most brutal and violent states within the U.S. orbit, based on the Abraham Accords, which formalized the tacit relations between Israel, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Morocco, with Saudi Arabia present implicitly via its satellite, the Bahrain dictatorship. They are joined at the summit by Egypt, now suffering under the most vicious dictatorship in its ugly history, with some 60,000 political prisoners and brutal repression. Egypt is the second-largest recipient of U.S. military aid, after Israel. There should be no need to review the sordid record of the leading recipient, recently designated the apartheid state by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. The UAE and Saudi Arabia share primary responsibility for what the UN describes as the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis: Yemen. The official death toll last year reached 370,000. The actual toll no one knows. The shattered country is facing mass starvation. Saudi Arabia has intensified its blockade of the sole port used for food and fuel imports. The UN is issuing extreme warnings, including the threat of imminent starvation of hundreds of thousands of children. The general warnings are echoed by U.S. specialists, notably Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution, formerly the top CIA analyst on the Middle East for four presidents. He charges that the Saudi \u201coffensive action\u201d should be investigated as a war crime. The Saudi and Emirati air forces cannot function without U.S. planes, training, intelligence, spare parts. Britain is taking part in the crime, along with other Western powers, but the U.S. is well in the lead. The Moroccan dictatorship was also welcomed by the Trump peace initiative. In his last days in office, Donald Trump even formally recognized Morocco\u2019s annexation of Western Sahara in defiance of the UN Security Council and the International Court of Justice \u2014 incidentally firming up Morocco\u2019s virtual monopoly of potassium, a vital and irreplaceable resource, now within U.S. domains. Authorizing of Morocco\u2019s criminal annexation should have come as no surprise. It followed Trump\u2019s recognition of Israel\u2019s annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights and of vastly expanded Greater Jerusalem, in both cases in violation of Security Council orders. Trump\u2019s support for violation of international law was undertaken in both cases in the splendid isolation that the U.S. often enjoys, as in its torture of Cuba for 60 years. These are just further illustrations of the commitment to the \u201crule of law\u201d and the sanctity of sovereignty that Washington has demonstrated for 70 years in Iran, Guatemala, Brazil, Chile, Iraq, and on and on \u2014 the commitment that requires the U.S. to extend the welcome mat to Ukraine to join NATO. The summit that we are now celebrating is a direct outgrowth of the Abraham Accords. For implementing them, Jared Kushner has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize (by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz). The Abraham Accords and today\u2019s Negev Summit are by no mean the first time that Washington has demonstrated its dedication to peaceful settlement of conflicts. After all, Henry Kissinger won the Nobel Peace Prize for his achievements in bringing peace to Vietnam, shortly after issuing one of the most extraordinary calls for genocide in the diplomatic record: \u201dA massive bombing campaign in Cambodia. Anything that flies on anything that moves.\u201d The consequences were horrendous, but no matter. Kissinger\u2019s prize brings to mind the reported proposal by an Israeli physicist that [founder of Israel\u2019s Likud party and former prime minister] Menachem Begin should be granted the physics prize. When asked why, he said: \u201cLook, he\u2019s been granted the Peace Prize, so why not the Physics Prize?\u201d Sometimes the quip is unfair. Jimmy Carter surely deserved the Peace Prize that was awarded for his efforts after he left the presidency, though the award committee emphasized that while still in office, President Carter\u2019s \u201cvital contribution to the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt [was] in itself a great enough achievement to qualify for the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d Carter\u2019s 1978 efforts were also no doubt undertaken with the best of intentions. It didn\u2019t quite turn out that way. Menachem Begin did agree to abandon Israel\u2019s project of settling the Egyptian Sinai but insisted that Palestinian rights should be excluded from the accords, and illegal settlement sharply increased under Ariel Sharon\u2019s direction, always with vital U.S. aid and in violation of Security Council directives. And as Israeli strategic analysts quickly pointed out, removal of the Egyptian deterrent freed Israel to escalate its attacks on Lebanon, leading finally to the U.S.-backed 1982 invasion that killed some 20,000 Lebanese and Palestinians and destroyed much of Lebanon, with no credible pretext. Ronald Reagan finally ordered Israel to end the assault when the bombing of the capital city of Beirut was causing international embarrassment to Washington. It of course complied but maintained its control of South Lebanon with constant atrocities against what it called \u201cterrorist villagers\u201d resisting the brutal occupation. It also established a vicious torture chamber in Khiam, which was kept as a memorial after Israel was forced finally to withdraw by Hezbollah guerrilla warfare. I was taken through it before it was destroyed by Israeli bombing to erase memory of the crime. So, yes, there are some cases when the U.S., like other hegemonic imperial powers before it, has sought to resolve conflicts by peaceful means."

Trump accelerated tendencies that trace back to Newt Gingrich\u2019s takeover of the party 30 years ago.

At the very least, a serious internal crisis is taking shape. There has long been much talk about American decline. To the extent that it is real, the major factor is internal. If we look deeper, much of the internal social decay results from the brutal impact of the neoliberal programs of the past 40 years, topics we\u2019ve discussed before.

And the overall political culture in the U.S. is not too keen at all on permitting dissident voices to be widely heard in the public arena. Do you wish to comment on these foundational features of the political culture in the United States?",
    "output": "This is too large a topic to take up here. And much too important for casual comment. But it\u2019s worth remembering that, once again, it is nothing new. We all recall when the august Senate changed French fries to \u201cfreedom fries\u201d in furious reaction to France\u2019s impudent refusal to join in Washington\u2019s criminal assault on Iraq. We may see something similar soon if President Macron of France, one of the few reasonable voices in high Western circles, continues to call for moderation in words and actions and for exploring diplomatic options. The easy decline to scaremongering goes back much further, reaching comic depths when the U.S. entered World War I and all things German instantly became anathema. The plague you mention is not confined to U.S. shores. To take one personal example, I recently heard from a colleague that an article of his was returned to him, unread, by a highly respected philosophy journal in England, with a notice that the article could not be considered because he is a citizen of a country under sanctions: Iran. The sanctions are strongly opposed by Europe, but as usual, it submits to the Master, even to the extent of banning an article by an Iranian philosopher. Putin\u2019s great gift to Washington has been to intensify this subordination to power. I can add many examples right here, some from my own personal experience, but it should not be overlooked that the malignancy spreads well beyond. We live in dangerous times. We may recall that the Doomsday Clock abandoned minutes and shifted to seconds under Trump, and is now set at 100 seconds to midnight \u2014 termination. The analysts who set the clock give three reasons: nuclear war, environmental destruction, and collapse of democracy and a free public sphere, which undermines the hope that informed and aroused citizens will compel their governments to overcome the dual race to disaster. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated all three of these disastrous tendencies. The nuclear threat has sharply increased. The dire necessity of sharply reducing fossil fuel use had been reversed by adulation of the destroyers of life on Earth for saving civilization from the Russians. And democracy and a free public sphere are in ominous decline. It is all too reminiscent of 90 years ago, though the stakes are far higher today. Then, the U.S. responded to the crisis by leading the way to social democracy, largely under the impetus of a revived labor movement. Europe sank into fascist darkness. What will happen now is uncertain. The one certainty is that it is up to us."

One is the problem of influence between bodies at a distance, which defies the mechanical philosophy and makes our scientific theories unintelligible (for common sense). Here you adopt Lock\u2019s suggestion, essentially mysterianism: reality need not conform to our cognitive limitations. In particular, what we find indisputably intuitive\u2014that motion requires contact\u2014may turn out to be an illusion. But now consider how you approach the mystery of free will. This too goes beyond the mechanical philosophy. We perceive free will as involving a type of causation that is neither deterministic nor random. This is an indisputable intuition. But how do we know that it is not just like the \u201ccontact physics intuition\u201d\u2014a feature of our cognitive limitations rather than a feature of reality? Perhaps our actions are, after all, fully determined. No two situations are identical to the level of neural activity; minute differences at the molecular level may explain why I choose to move my arm in scenario A but not in scenario B, which look identical from our necessarily limited perspective. I feel that you would object to this analogy, and I wonder why. What makes our free will intuitions more reality-based than our (false) contact-physics intuitions?",
    "output": "As just discussed, I don\u2019t see the matter of action at a distance quite in the way you describe; much more was involved than violation of common sense. The analogy that you formulate seems to me fair enough. I have never questioned it. I think we can extend it. It seems to me that we (at least I) have conflicting intuitions about free will. One is that each of us believes, as firmly as anything we can conceive, that we can choose right now to raise a finger or not to\u2014even to put it into the flames, to take the Cartesian example. And in the case of language, keeping to Descartes and his contemporaries, we can speak in ways to which we are \u201cincited and inclined\u201d but not \u201ccompelled\u201d (\u201cthe creative aspect of language use\u201d). I could right now choose to report the weather outside but won\u2019t. We also have a conflicting intuition: that what happens in the world is determined (randomness aside). Turning to science, it provides no answers. It does not go beyond determinacy and randomness but does not refute the first intuition. For now, we cannot go beyond the conclusions of the leading scientists who study voluntary motion, Emilio Bizzi and Robert Ajemian, who write (\u201cfancifully,\u201d as they say) that \u201cwe have some idea as to the intricate design of the puppet and the puppet strings, but we lack insight into the mind of the puppeteer.\u201d We are therefore faced with two options. We can reject what we most firmly believe, relying on a conflicting intuition and the failure of science to provide answers. Or we can adopt some version of Descartes\u2019s conclusion in the letter to the queen of Sweden that I quoted: since \u201cthere is nothing we comprehend more evidently and more perfectly [than that] the free actions of men [are] undetermined, . . . it would be absurd\u201d to doubt something that \u201cwe comprehend intimately, and experience within ourselves\u201d merely because it conflicts with something else that is \u201cincomprehensible to us\u201d (Descartes goes beyond to allege that we know that it reduces to \u201cdivine preordination\u201d). In short, we have no answer. Rather, a decision\u2014which might be determined, hence not a decision, or might be ours to make on the basis of rational analysis. To return to your comment, at a fundamental level there should be no asymmetry. We do not know whether the collapse of the mechanical philosophy poses a mystery for humans, as Locke and Hume concluded (with Newton\u2019s indirect acknowledgment) or whether it is merely a problem (in the terminology I have been using). The rich history of the past half millennium suggests, to me at least, that Locke, Hume, and Newton were right, but the question is not settled\u2014though it is possible to imagine experimental studies that would bear on it, and in part there are, including classical work of Michotte and much more since. The same is true with regard to free will, where we (at least I) face conflicting intuitions, I personally feel inclined to suppose that there is some gap in our scientific understanding, perhaps an irremediable one for human science, and to adopt something like the Cartesian position, though leaving open the possibility that some entirely unknown aspect of the world is compelling me to do so and to write these words\u2014and to be more precise, not really \u201cleaving open the possibility\u201d because I am compelled even to do that\u2014so our discussion is really no more than an interaction between two automata governed by determinacy and randomness, with no reason or purpose. Just \u201csound and fury, signifying nothing.\u201d"

    "output": "The initiators of the Paris Agreement intended to have a binding treaty, not voluntary agreements, but there was an impediment. It\u2019s called the Republican Party. It was clear that the Republican Party would never accept any binding commitments. The Republican organization, which has lost any pretense of being a normal political party, is almost solely dedicated to the welfare of the super-rich and the corporate sector, and cares absolutely nothing about the population or the future of the world. The Republican organization would never have accepted a treaty. In response, the organizers reduced their goal to a voluntary agreement, which has all the difficulties that you mentioned. We\u2019ve lost six years, four under the Trump administration which was openly dedicated to maximizing the use of fossil fuels and dismantling the regulatory apparatus that, to some extent, had limited their lethal effects. To some extent, these regulations protected sectors of the population from pollution, mostly the poor and people of color. But they\u2019re the ones who, of course, face the main burden of pollution. It\u2019s the poor people of the world who live in what Trump called \u201cshithole countries\u201d that suffer the most; they have contributed the least to the disaster, and they suffer the worst. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. As you write in your new book,The Path to a Liveable Future, there is indeed a path to a livable future. There are ways to have responsible, sane, and racially just policies. It\u2019s up to all of us to demand them, something young people around the world are already doing. Other countries have their own things to answer for, but the United States has one of the worst records in the world. The United States blocked the Paris Agreement before Trump eventually got into office. But it was under Trump\u2019s instructions that the United States pulled out of the agreement altogether. If you look over at the more sane Democrats, who are far from guiltless, there are people called moderates like Senator Joe Manchin (D\u2013WV), the leading recipient of fossil-fuel funding, whose position is that of the fossil-fuel companies, which is, as he put it, no elimination, just innovation. That\u2019s Exxon Mobil\u2019s view, too: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll take care of you,\u201d they say. \u201cWe\u2019re a soulful corporation. We\u2019re investing in some futuristic ways to remove from the atmosphere the pollution that we\u2019re pouring into it. Everything\u2019s fine, just trust us.\u201d No elimination, just innovation, which may or may not come and if it does, it will probably be too late and too limited."

    "output": "Well, we have to face some realities. I would like to see a move towards a more free and just society \u2014 production for need rather than production for profit, working people able to control their own lives instead of subordinating themselves to masters for almost their entire waking life. The time required for succeeding at such efforts is simply too great for addressing this crisis. That means we need to solve this within the framework of existing institutions, which can be ameliorated. The economic system of the last 40 years has been particularly destructive. It\u2019s inflicted a major assault on most of the population, resulting in a huge growth in inequality and attacks on democracy and the environment. livable future is possible. We don\u2019t have to live in a system in which the tax rules have been changed so that billionaires pay lower rates than working people. We don\u2019t have to live in a form of state capitalism in which the lower 90% of income earners have been robbed of approximately $50 trillion, for the benefit of a fraction of 1%. That\u2019s the estimate of the RAND Corporation, a serious underestimate if we look at other devices that have been used. There are ways of reforming the existing system within basically the same framework of institutions. I think they ought to change, but it would have to be over a longer timescale. The question is: Can we prevent climate catastrophe within the framework of less savage state capitalist institutions? I think there\u2019s a reason to believe that we can, and there are very careful, detailed proposals as to how to do it, including ones in your new book, as well as the proposals of my friend and co-author, economist Robert Pollin, who\u2019s worked many of these things out in great detail. Jeffrey Sachs, another fine economist, using somewhat different models, has come to pretty much the same conclusions. These are pretty much along lines of proposals of the International Energy Association, by no means a radical organization, one that grew out of the energy corporations. But they all have essentially the same picture. There\u2019s, in fact, even a congressional resolution by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey which outlines proposals that are pretty close to this. And I think it\u2019s all within the range of feasibility. Their cost estimates of 2% to 3% of GDP, with feasible efforts, would not only address the crisis, but would create a more livable future, one without pollution, without traffic jams, and with more constructive, productive work, better jobs. All of this is possible. But there are serious barriers \u2014 the fossil-fuel industries, the banks, the other major institutions, which are designed to maximize profit and not care about anything else. After all, that was the announced slogan of the neoliberal period \u2014 the economic guru Milton Friedman\u2019s pronouncement that corporations have no responsibility to the public or to the workforce, that their total responsibility is to maximize profit for the few. For public-relations reasons, fossil-fuel corporations like ExxonMobil often portray themselves as soulful and benevolent, working day and night for the benefit of the common good. It\u2019s called greenwashing."

You want to do analyses like that in your academic seminar? OK, go ahead. But don\u2019t dare translate it into policy. Don\u2019t dare to do that. There\u2019s a striking difference between physicists and economists. Physicists don\u2019t say, hey, let\u2019s try an experiment that might destroy the world, because it would be interesting to see what would happen. But economists do that. On the basis of neoclassical theories, they instituted a major revolution in world affairs in the early 1980s that took off with Carter, and accelerated with Reagan and Thatcher. Given the power of the United States compared with the rest of the world, the neoliberal assault, a major experiment in economic theory, had a devastating result. It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure it out. Their motto has been, \u201cGovernment is the problem.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean you eliminate decisions; it just means you transfer them. Decisions still have to be made. If they\u2019re not made by government, which is, in a limited way, under popular influence, they will be made by concentrations of private power, which have no accountability to the public. And following the Friedman instructions, have no responsibility to the society that gave them the gift of incorporation. They have only the imperative of self-enrichment. Margaret Thatcher then comes along and says there is no such thing as society, just atomized individuals who are somehow managing in the market. Of course, there is a small footnote that she didn\u2019t bother to add: for the rich and powerful, there is plenty of society. Organizations like the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, ALEC, all kinds of others. They get together, they defend themselves, and so on. There is plenty of society for them, just not for the rest of us. Most people have to face the ravages of the market. And, of course, the rich don\u2019t. Corporations count on a powerful state to bail them out every time there\u2019s some trouble. The rich have to have the powerful state \u2014 as well as its police powers \u2014 to be sure nobody gets in their way."

Zionist policies since have been opportunistic.When possible, the Israeli government \u2014 and indeed the entire Zionist movement \u2014 adopts strategies of terror and expulsion.Whencircumstances don\u2019t allow that,it usessofter means.

There is no thought ofgrantingPalestiniansrights to return to homes from which they\u2019ve been expelled, evenrightsto build onwhat\u2019s left to them. Israel\u2019s1967 conquestsmade it possible to extend similar measures to the conquered territories, in this case ingrossviolation of international law, as Israeli leaders were informedright awayby their highest legal authorities. The new projects were facilitatedby the radical change in U.S.-Israeli relations.Pre-1967 relationshad been generallywarm but ambiguous.After thewarthey reachedunprecedentedheights of support for a client state. The Israeli victory was a great gift to the U.S.government.A proxy war had been underway between radical Islam (based inSaudi Arabia) and secular nationalism (Nasser\u2019s Egypt).Like Britain before it, the U.S.tended toprefer radical Islam,which itconsidered less threatening toU.S.imperial domination.Israel smashed Arab secular nationalism. Israel\u2019s military prowess had already impressed the U.S.military command in 1948, and the \u201967 victory made it very clear that a militarized Israeli state could be asolidbase for U.S.power in the region\u2014also providingimportant secondary services in support of U.S.imperial goals beyond.U.S.regional dominance came to rest on three pillars: Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran (then under the Shah).Technically, they were all at war, but inrealitythe alliance was very close, particularly between Israel andthe murderousIranian tyranny. Withinthat international framework, Israel was free to pursue the policies that persist today, always with massive U.S.support despite occasional clucks of discontent. TheIsraeli government\u2019simmediatepolicy goal is toconstructa\u201cGreater Israel,\u201dincludinga vastly expanded \u201cJerusalem\u201dencompassing surrounding Arab villages;the Jordan valley, a large part of the West Bank with much ofitsarable land;andmajor towns deep inside the West Bank, along with Jews-only infrastructure projects integrating them into Israel.The projectbypassesPalestinian population concentrations, like Nablus, so as tofend offwhat Israeli leaders describe asthe dread \u201cdemographicproblem\u201d:too many non-Jews inthe projected\u201cdemocratic Jewish state\u201dof\u201cGreater Israel\u201d\u2014an oxymoron more difficult tomouthwith each passing year.Palestinianswithin\u201cGreater Israel\u201dare confined to 165 enclaves, separated from theirlands and olive groves bya hostile military, subjected to constant attack by violent Jewish gangs (\u201chilltop youths\u201d) protected by the Israeli army. Meanwhile Israel settledand annexedthe Golan Heights in violation ofUNSecurity Council orders (asitdidin Jerusalem).The Gaza horror story is too complex to recount here.It isone of the worst of contemporary crimes, shrouded in a dense network of deceitand apologetics for atrocities. Trumpwent beyond his predecessorsinprovidingfree rein for Israeli crimes.One major contribution was orchestrating the Abraham Accords, which formalized long-standing tacit agreementsbetween Israel andseveralArab dictatorships.That relieved limited Arabrestraintson Israeli violence and expansion. TheAccords werea keycomponentof theTrump geostrategic vision: to construct a reactionary alliance of brutal and repressive states,run from Washington,including [Jair] Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil, [Narendra] Modi\u2019s India, [Viktor]Orb\u00e1n\u2019sHungary, and eventually others like them.The Middle East-North Africa component is based on al-Sisi\u2019s hideous Egyptian tyranny,andnowunder the Accords,alsofamily dictatorships from Morocco to the UAE and Bahrain.Israel provides the military muscle, with the U.S.in the immediate background. The Abraham Accords fulfillanother Trumpobjective: bringing under Washington\u2019s umbrella the major resource areas needed to accelerate the race toward environmental cataclysm,the cause to which Trump and associates dedicated themselves with impressive fervor.That includes Morocco, which has a near monopoly of the phosphates needed for the industrialized agriculture that is destroying soils and poisoning the atmosphere.To enhance the Moroccannear-monopoly, Trumpofficiallyrecognizedand affirmedMorocco\u2019s brutal andillegal occupation of Western Sahara, which also has phosphate deposits. It is of some interest that the formalization of the alliance of some of the world\u2019s most violent, repressive and reactionary states has been greatly applauded across a broad spectrum of opinion. So far, Biden has taken over these programs.He has rescinded the gratuitousbrutalityof Trumpism, such as withdrawing the fragile lifeline for Gaza because, asTrumpexplained, Palestinians had not been grateful enough for his demolition of their just aspirations.OtherwisetheTrump-Kushner criminaledificeremains intact, though some specialists on the region think it might totter with repeated Israeli attacks onPalestinianworshippers in the al-Aqsa mosque and other exercises of Israel\u2019s effective monopoly of violence."

    "input": "C. J. Polychroniou: Noam, since neoliberal policies were implemented more than 40 years ago, they have been responsible for increasing rates of inequality, destroying social infrastructure, and causing hopelessness and social malaise. However, it has also become evident that neoliberal social and economic policies are breeding grounds for right-wing radicalization and the resurgence of political authoritarianism. Of course, we know that there is an inherent clash between democracy and capitalism, but there is some clear evidence that neofascism emerges from neoliberal capitalism. Assuming that you agree with this claim, what\u2019s the actual connection between neoliberalism and neofascism?",
    "output": "The connection is drawn clearly in the first two sentences of the question. One consequence of the neoliberal social-economic policies is collapse of the social order, yielding a breeding ground for extremism, violence, hatred, search for scapegoats \u2014 and fertile terrain for authoritarian figures who can posture as the savior. And we\u2019re on the road to a form of neo-fascism. TheBritannicadefines neoliberalism as an \u201cideology and policy model that emphasizes the value of free market competition,\u201d with \u201cminimal state intervention.\u201d That is the conventional picture. Reality is different. The actual policy model threw open the doors for the masters of the economy, who also dominate the state, to seek profit and power with few constraints. In brief, unconstrained class war. One component of the policies was a form of globalization that combines extreme protectionism for the masters with search for the cheapest labor and worst working conditions so as to maximize profit, leaving decaying rust belts at home. These are policy choices, not economic necessity. The labor movement, joined by Congress\u2019s now defunct research bureau, proposed alternatives that could have benefited working people here and abroad, but they were dismissed without discussion as Clinton rammed through the form of globalization preferred by those conducting the class war. related consequence of \u201creally existing neoliberalism\u201d was rapid financialization of the economy enabling riskless scams for quick profits \u2014 riskless because the powerful state that intervenes radically in the market to provide extreme protections in trade agreements does the same to rescue the masters if something goes wrong. The result, beginning with Reagan, is what economists Robert Pollin and Gerald Epstein call a \u201cbailout economy,\u201d enabling the neoliberal class war to proceed without the risk of market punishment for failure. The \u201cfree market\u201d is not missing from the picture. Capital is \u201cfree\u201d to exploit and destroy with abandon, as it has been doing, including \u2014 we should not forget \u2014 destroying the prospects for organized human life. And working people are \u201cfree\u201d to try to survive somehow with real wages stagnating, benefits declining and work being reshaped to create a growing precariat. The class war took off, very naturally, with an attack on labor unions, the prime means of defense for working people. The first acts of Reagan and Thatcher were vigorous assaults on unions, an invitation to the corporate sector to join in and move beyond, often in ways that are technically illegal, but that is of no concern to the neoliberal state they dominate. The reigning ideology was expressed lucidly by Margaret Thatcher as the class war was launched: There is no such thing as society, and people should stop whining about \u201csociety\u201d coming to their rescue. In her immortal words, \u201c\u2018I am homeless, the Government must house me!\u2019 and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families, and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first.\u201d Thatcher and her associates surely knew very well that there is a very rich and powerful society for the masters, not only the nanny state that races to their rescue when they are in need but also an elaborate network of trade associations, chambers of commerce, lobbying organizations, think tanks, and more. But those less privileged must \u201clook to themselves.\u201d The neoliberal class war has been a grand success for the designers. As we\u2019ve discussed, one indication is the transfer of some $50 trillion to the pockets of the top 1 percent, mostly to a fraction of them. no slight victory. Other achievements are \u201chopelessness and social malaise,\u201d with nowhere to turn. The Democrats abandoned the working class to their class enemy by the \u201870s, becoming a party of affluent professionals and Wall Street donors. In England, Jeremy Corbyn came close to reversing the decline of the Labour Party to \u201cThatcher lite.\u201d The British establishment, across the board, mobilized in force and climbed deep into the gutter to crush his effort to create an authentic participatory party devoted to the interests of working people and the poor. An intolerable affront to good order. In the U.S., Bernie Sanders has fared somewhat better, but has not been able to break the hold of Clintonite party management. In Europe, the traditional parties of the left have virtually disappeared. In the midterm elections in the U.S., the Democrats lost even more of the white working class than before, a consequence of the unwillingness of party managers to campaign on class issues that a moderate left party could have brought to the fore. The ground is well prepared for the rise of neofascism to fill the void left by unremitting class war and capitulation of the mainstream political institutions that might have combatted the plague. The term \u201cclass war\u201d is by now insufficient. It\u2019s true that the masters of the economy and their servants in the political system have been engaged in a particularly savage form of class war for the past 40 years, but the targets go beyond the usual victims, now extending even to the perpetrators themselves. As the class war intensifies, the basic logic of capitalism manifests itself with brutal clarity: We have to maximize profit and power even though we know we are racing to suicide by destroying the environment that sustains life, not sparing ourselves and our families. What\u2019s happening calls to mind an often repeated tale on how to catch a monkey. Cut a hole in a coconut of just the right size for a monkey to insert its paw and put some delectable morsel inside. The monkey will reach in to grab the food but will then be unable to extricate its clenched paw and will starve to death. That\u2019s us, at least the ones running the sad show. Our leaders, with their similarly clenched paws, are pursuing their suicidal vocation relentlessly. At the state level, Republicans are introducing \u201cEnergy Discrimination Elimination\u201d legislation to ban even release of information on investment in fossil fuel companies. That\u2019s unfair persecution of decent folks who are just trying to profit by destroying the prospects for human life, adopting good capitalist logic. To take one recent example, Republican attorneys general have called on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to keep asset managers from purchasing shares in U.S. utility companies if the companies are involved in programs to reduce emissions \u2014 that is, to save us all from destruction. The champion of the lot, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, calls for investment in fossil fuels for many years ahead, while showing that he is a good citizen by welcoming opportunities to invest in still fanciful ways to get rid of the poisons that are produced and even in green energy \u2014 as long as profits are guaranteed to be high. In short, instead of devoting resources to escape from catastrophe, we must bribe the very rich to induce them to lend a hand in doing so. The lessons, stark and clear, are helping to invigorate popular movements that are seeking to escape from the shambles of capitalist logic that shine through with brilliant clarity as the neoliberal war against all reaches its latest stages of tragicomedy. That is the bright and hopeful side of the emerging social order."

    "output": "What do we mean by \u201cfascism\u201d? We have to distinguish what\u2019s happening in the streets, very visibly, from ideology and policy, more remote from immediate inspection. Fascism in the streets is Mussolini\u2019s Blackshirts and Hitler\u2019s Brownshirts: violent, brutal, destructive. The U.S. has surely never been immune from that. The sordid record of \u201cIndian removal\u201d and slavery mutating to Jim Crow needs no recounting here. peak period of \u201cstreet-fascism\u201d in this sense just preceded Mussolini\u2019s March on Rome. The postwar Wilson-Palmer, post-WWI \u201cred scare\u201d was the most vicious period of violent repression in U.S. history, apart from the two original sins. The shocking story is recounted in vivid detail in Adam Hochschild\u2019s penetrating studyAmerican Midnight. As usual, Black people suffered the most, including major massacres (Tulsa and others) and a hideous record of lynchings and other atrocities. Immigrants were another target in a wave of fanatic \u201cAmericanism\u201d and fear of Bolshevism. Hundreds of \u201csubversives\u201d were deported. The lively Socialist Party was virtually destroyed and never recovered. Labor was decimated, not only the Wobblies but well beyond, including vicious strike-breaking in the name of patriotism and defense against the \u201creds.\u201d The level of lunacy finally became so outlandish that it self-destructed. Attorney-General Palmer and his sidekick J. Edgar Hoover predicted an insurrection led by Bolsheviks on May Day 1920, with feverish warnings and mobilization of police, army and vigilantes. The day passed with a few picnics. Widespread ridicule and wish for \u201cnormalcy\u201d brought an end to the madness. Not without a residue. As Hochschild observes, progressive options for American society suffered a severe blow. A very different country could have emerged. What took place was street fascism with a vengeance. Turning to ideology and policy, the great Veblenite political economist Robert Brady 80 years ago argued that the whole industrial capitalist world was moving towards one or another form of fascism, with powerful state control of the economy and social life. On a separate dimension, the systems differed sharply with regard to public influence over policy (functioning political democracy). Such themes were not uncommon in those years, and to a limited extent beyond both in left and right circles. The issue becomes mostly moot with the shift from the regulated capitalism of the postwar decades to the neoliberal assault, which forcefully reinstitutes Adam Smith\u2019s conception that the masters of the economy are the principal architects of government policy and design it to protect their interests. Increasingly in the course of neoliberal class war, unaccountable concentrations of private power control both the economy and the political domain. The result is a general sense \u2014 not mistaken \u2014 that the government is not serving us, but rather someone else. The doctrinal system, also largely in the hands of the same concentrations of private power, deflects attention away from the workings of power, opening the door to what are termed \u201cconspiracy theories,\u201d usually founded on some particles of evidence: the Great Replacement, liberal elites, Jews, other familiar concoctions. That in turn engenders \u201cstreet fascism,\u201d drawing on poisonous undercurrents that have never been suppressed and that can easily be tapped by unscrupulous demagogues. The scale and character is by now no small threat to what remains of functioning democracy after the battering of the current era."

    "input": "Some are arguing that we live in a historic age of protests. Indeed, virtually every region in the world has seen a sharp increase of protest movements over the last 15 years. Why have political protests become more widespread and more frequent in the age of late neoliberalism? Moreover, how do they compare to the protest movements of the 1960s?",
    "output": "The protests have many different roots. The trucker\u2019s strike that almost brought Brazil to a halt protesting the defeat of the neo-fascist Bolsonaro in the October election had some resemblance to January 6 in Washington, and may be reenacted, some fear, on the day of the inauguration of the elected President Lula da Silva on January 1. But such protests as these have nothing in common with the remarkable uprising in Iran instigated by the death in police custody of Jina Mahsa Amini. The uprising is led by young people, mostly young women, though it is bringing in much broader sectors. The immediate goal is overturning the rigid controls on women\u2019s attire and behavior, though the protesters have gone well beyond, sometimes as far as calling for overthrow of the harsh clerical regime. The protestors have won some victories. The regime has indicated that the Morality Police will be disbanded, though some doubt the substance of the announcement, and it barely reaches the demands of the courageous resistance. Other protests have their own particularities. Insofar as there is a common thread, it is the breakdown of social order generally in the past decades. Commonalities with \u201860s protest movements seem to me thin."

    "input": "Whatever the connection may be between neoliberalism and social unrest, it is nonetheless clear that socialism is still struggling to gain popularity with citizens in most parts of the world. Why is that? Is it the legacy of \u201cactually existing socialism\u201d that hinders progress toward a socialist future?",
    "output": "As with fascism, the first question is what we mean by \u201csocialism.\u201d Broadly speaking the term used to refer to social ownership of the means of production, with worker control of enterprises. \u201cActually existing socialism\u201d had virtually no resemblance to those ideals. In western usage \u201csocialism\u201d has come to mean something like welfare state capitalism, covering a range of options. Such initiatives have often been suppressed by violence. The red scare mentioned earlier is one example, with long-lasting effects. Not long after, the Great Depression and World War evoked waves of radical democracy throughout much of the world. A primary task of the victors was to suppress them, beginning with the U.S.-U.K. invasion of Italy, disbanding the partisan-led worker- and peasant-based socialist initiatives and restoring the traditional order, including fascist collaborators. The pattern was followed elsewhere in various ways, sometimes with extreme violence. Russia imposed its iron rule in its own domains. In the Third World, repression of similar tendencies was far more brutal, not excluding church-based initiatives, crushed by U.S. violence in Latin America, where the U.S. army officially claims credit for having helped to defeat liberation theology. Are the basic ideas unpopular, when extricated from the imagery of hostile propaganda? There is good reason to suspect that they are hardly below the surface and can burst forth when opportunities arise and are exploited."

Polychroniou: Noam, nearly two weeks into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces continue to pummel cities and towns while more than 140 countries voted in favor of a UN nonbinding resolution condemning the invasion and calling for a withdrawal of Russian troops. In light of Russia\u2019s failure to comply with rules of international law, isn\u2019t there something to be said at the present juncture about the institutions and norms of the postwar international order? It\u2019s quite obvious that the Westphalian state-centric world order cannot regulate the geopolitical behavior of state actors with respect to issues of war/peace and even sustainability. Isn\u2019t it therefore a matter of survival that we develop a new global normative architecture?",
    "output": "If it really is literally a matter of survival, then we are lost, because it cannot be achieved in any relevant time frame. The most we can hope for now is strengthening what exists, which is very weak. And that will be hard enough. The great powers constantly violate international law, as do smaller ones when they can get away with it, commonly under the umbrella of a great power protector, as when Israel illegally annexes the Syrian Golan Heights and Greater Jerusalem \u2014 tolerated by Washington, authorized by Donald Trump, who also authorized Morocco\u2019s illegal annexation of Western Sahara. Under international law, it is the responsibility of the UN Security Council to keep the peace and, if deemed necessary, to authorize force. Superpower aggression doesn\u2019t reach the Security Council: U.S. wars in Indochina, the U.S.-U.K. invasion of Iraq, or Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, to take three textbook examples of the \u201csupreme international crime\u201d for which Nazis were hanged at Nuremberg. More precisely, the U.S. is untouchable. Russian crimes at least receive some attention. The Security Council may consider other atrocities, such as the French-British-Israeli invasion of Egypt and the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956. But the veto blocks further action. The former was reversed by orders of a superpower (the U.S.), which opposed the timing and manner of the aggression. The latter crime, by a superpower, could only be protested. Superpower contempt for the international legal framework is so common as to pass almost unnoticed. In 1986, the International Court of Justice condemned Washington for its terrorist war (in legalistic jargon, \u201cunlawful use of force\u201d) against Nicaragua, ordering it to desist and pay substantial reparations. The U.S. dismissed the judgment with contempt (with the support of the liberal press) and escalated the attack. The UN Security Council did try to react with a resolution calling on all nations to observe international law, mentioning no one, but everyone understood the intention. The U.S. vetoed it, proclaiming loud and clear that it is immune to international law. It has disappeared from history. It is rarely recognized that contempt for international law also entails contempt for the U.S. Constitution, which we are supposed to treat with the reverence accorded to the Bible. Article VI of the Constitution establishes the UN Charter as \u201cthe supreme law of the land,\u201d binding on elected officials, including, for example, every president who resorts to the threat of force (\u201call options are open\u201d) \u2014 banned by the Charter. There are learned articles in the legal literature arguing that the words don\u2019t mean what they say. They do. It\u2019s all too easy to continue. One outcome, which we have discussed, is that in U.S. discourse, including scholarship, it is nowde rigueurto reject the UN-based international order in favor of a \u201crule-based international order,\u201d with the tacit understanding that the U.S. effectively set the rules. Even if international law (and the U.S. Constitution) were to be obeyed, its reach would be limited. It would not reach as far as Russia\u2019s horrendous Chechnya wars, levelling the capital city of Grozny, perhaps a hideous forecast for Kyiv unless a peace settlement is reached; or in the same years, Turkey\u2019s war against Kurds, killing tens of thousands, destroying thousands of towns and villages, driving hundreds of thousands to miserable slums in Istanbul, all strongly supported by the Clinton administration which escalated its huge flow of arms as the crimes increased. International law does not bar the U.S. specialty of murderous sanctions to punish \u201csuccessful defiance,\u201d or stealing the funds of Afghans while they face mass starvation. Nor does it bar torturing a million children in Gaza or a million Uighurs sent to \u201cre-education camps.\u201d And all too much more. How can this be changed? Not much is likely to be achieved by establishing a new \u201cparchment barrier,\u201d to borrow James Madison\u2019s phrase, referring to mere words on paper. A more adequate framework of international order may be useful for educational and organizing purposes \u2014 as indeed international law is. But it is not enough to protect the victims. That can only be achieved by compelling the powerful to cease their crimes \u2014 or in the longer run, undermining their power altogether. That\u2019s what many thousands of courageous Russians are doing right now in their remarkable efforts to impede Putin\u2019s war machine. It is what Americans have done in protesting the many crimes of their state, facing much less serious repression, with good effect even if insufficient. Steps can be taken to construct a less dangerous and more humane world order. For all its flaws, the European Union is a step forward beyond what existed before. The same is true of the African Union, however limited it remains. And in the Western hemisphere, the same is true for such initiatives as UNASUR [the Union of South American Nations] and CELAC [the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States], the latter seeking Latin American-Caribbean integration separate from the U.S.-dominated Organization of American States. The questions arise constantly in one or another form. Up to virtually the day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the crime very possibly could have been averted by pursuing options that were well understood: Austrian-style neutrality for Ukraine, some version of Minsk II federalism reflecting the actual commitments of Ukrainians on the ground. There was little pressure to induce Washington to pursue peace. Nor did Americans join in the worldwide ridicule of the odes to sovereignty on the part of the superpower that is in a class by itself in its brutal disdain for the notion. The options still remain, though narrowed after the criminal invasion. Putin demonstrated the same reflexive resort to violence although peaceful options were available. It\u2019s true that the U.S. continued to dismiss what even high U.S. officials and top-ranking diplomats have long understood to be legitimate Russian security concerns, but options other than criminal violence remained open. Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe observers had been reporting sharply increased violence in the Donbas region, which many \u2014 not just Russia \u2014 charge was largely at Ukrainian initiative. Putin could have sought to establish that charge, if it is correct, and to bring it to international attention. That would have strengthened his position. More significantly, Putin could have pursued the opportunities, which were real, to appeal to Germany and France to carry forward the prospects for a \u201ccommon European home\u201d along the lines proposed by De Gaulle and Gorbachev, a European system with no military alliances from the Atlantic to the Urals, even beyond, replacing the Atlanticist NATO-based system of subordination to Washington. That has been the core background issue for a long time, heightened during the current crisis. A \u201ccommon European home\u201d offers many advantages to Europe. Intelligent diplomacy might have advanced the prospects. Instead of pursuing diplomatic options, Putin reached for the revolver, an all-too-common reflex of power. The result is devastating for Ukraine, with the worst probably still to come. The outcome is also a very welcome gift to Washington, as Putin has succeeded in establishing the Atlanticist system even more solidly than before. The gift is so welcome that some sober and well-informed analysts have speculated that it was Washington\u2019s goal all along. We should be thinking hard about these matters. One useful exercise is to compare the rare appearance of \u201cjaw-jaw\u201d with the deluge on \u201cwar-war,\u201d to borrow Churchill\u2019s rhetoric. Perhaps peacemakers are indeed the blessed. If so, the good Lord doesn\u2019t have to put in overtime hours."

    "input": "Speaking of the need for a new global architecture and diplomatic practice to adopt to the present-day global dynamic, Putin repeated, in a recent telephone conversation he had with French President Emmanuel Macron, the list of Russia\u2019s grievances against the West, and hinted at a way out of the crisis. Yet, there was, again, rejection of Putin\u2019s demands and, even more inexplicably, complete suppression of this ray of light offered by Putin. Do you wish to comment on this matter?",
    "output": "Regrettably, it is not inexplicable. Rather, it is entirely normal and predictable. Buried in the press report of the Putin-Macron conversation, with the routine inflammatory headline about the goals of Putin, was a brief report of what Putin actually said: \u201cIn its own readout of the call, the Kremlin said that Mr. Putin had told his French counterpart that his main goal was \u2018the demilitarization and neutral status of Ukraine.\u2019 Those goals, the Kremlin said, \u2018will be achieved no matter what.\u2019\u201d In a rational world, this comment would be headlined, and commentators would be calling on Washington to seize what may be an opportunity to end the invasion before a major catastrophe that will devastate Ukraine and may even lead to terminal war if Putin is not offered an escape hatch from the disaster he has created. Instead, we\u2019re hearing the usual \u201cwar-war\u201d pronouncements, pretty much across the board, beginning with the renowned foreign policy analyst Thomas Friedman. TodayThe New York Timestough guy counsels, \u201cVladimir, you haven\u2019t felt the half of it yet.\u201d Friedman\u2019s essay is a celebration of the \u201ccancellation of Mother Russia.\u201d It may be usefully compared to his reaction to comparable or worse atrocities for which he shares responsibility. He is not alone. That\u2019s how things are in a very free but deeply conformist intellectual culture. rational response to Putin\u2019s reiteration of his \u201cmain goal\u201d would be to take him up on it and to offer what has long been understood to be the basic framework for peaceful resolution: to repeat, \u201cAustrian-style neutrality for Ukraine, some version of Minsk II federalism reflecting the actual commitments of Ukrainians on the ground.\u201d Rationality would also entail doing this without the pathetic posturing about sovereign rights for which we have utter contempt \u2014 and which are not infringed any more than Mexico\u2019s sovereignty is infringed by the fact that it cannot join a Chinese-based military alliance and host joint Mexico-China military maneuvers and Chinese offensive weapons aimed at the U.S. All of this is feasible, but it assumes something remote, a rational world, and furthermore, a world in which Washington is not gloating about the marvelous gift that Putin has just presented to it: a fully subordinate Europe, with no nonsense about escaping the control of the Master. The message for us is the same as always, and as always simple and crystal clear. We must bend every effort to create a survivable world."

In fact, Washington itself seems to be eager to get the Chinese involved, as Xi Jinping could be the only leader to force Putin to reconsider his actions in Ukraine. Do you see China playing the role of a peace mediator between Russia and Ukraine, and perhaps even emerge soon as a global peace mediator?",
    "output": "China could try to assume this role, but it doesn\u2019t seem likely. Chinese analysts can see as easily as we can that there had always been a way to avert catastrophe, along lines that we\u2019ve discussed repeatedly in earlier interviews, briefly reiterated here. They can also see that while the options are diminished, it would still be possible to satisfy Putin\u2019s \u201cmain goal\u201d in ways that would be beneficial to all, infringing on no basic rights. And they can see that the U.S. government is not interested, nor the commentariat. They may see little inducement to plunge in. It\u2019s not clear that they would even want to. They\u2019re doing well enough by keeping out of the conflict. They are continuing to integrate much of the world within the China-based investment and development system, with Turkey \u2014 a NATO member \u2014 very possible next in line. China also knows that the Global South has little taste for \u201ccanceling Mother Russia\u201d but would prefer to maintain relations. The South may well share the horror at the cruelty of the invasion, but their experiences are not those of Europe and the U.S. They are, after all, the traditional targets of European-U.S. brutality, alongside of which the suffering of Ukraine hardly stands out. The experiences and memories are shared by China from its \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d and far more. While the West may choose not to perceive this, China can certainly understand. I presume that they\u2019ll keep their distance and proceed on their current path."

Indeed, back in December 2021, the head of the Russian Academy of Science\u2019s Center for Ukrainian Research, Viktor Mironenko, warned that Ukraine could become another Afghanistan. What are your thoughts on this matter? Hasn\u2019t Putin learned any lessons from Afghanistan?",
    "output": "If Russia does occupy Ukraine, its miserable experience in Afghanistan will resemble a picnic in the park. We should bear in mind that the cases are quite different. The documentary record reveals that Russia invaded Afghanistan very reluctantly, several months after President Carter authorized the CIA to \u201cprovide ... support to the Afghan insurgents\u201d who were opposing a Russian-backed government \u2014 with the strong support if not initiative of National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, as he later proudly declared. There was never any basis for the frenzied pronouncements about Russian plans to take over the Middle East and beyond. Again, George Kennan\u2019s quite isolated rejection of these claims was astute and accurate. The U.S. provided strong support for the Mujahideen who were resisting the Russian invasion, not in order to help liberate Afghanistan but rather to \u201ckill Soviet Soldiers,\u201d as explained by the CIA station chief in Islamabad who was running the operation. For Russia, the cost was terrible, though of course, hardly a fraction of what Afghanistan suffered \u2014 continuing when the U.S.-backed Islamic fundamentalists ravaged the country after the Russians withdrew. One hesitates even to imagine what occupying Ukraine would bring to its people, if not to the world. It can be averted. That is the crucial point."

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: Noam, while many in the country and the world at large watch aghast as Donald Trump\u2019s nightmare of white supremacy continues to unravel the United States, it still remains something of a puzzle as to what propelled Trumpism to political prominence. For starters, why did voters turn to Trump? Who are the people that make up his hard-core base, and how do we explain the fact that he has essentially taken over the Republican Party without any serious opposition?",
    "output": "Part of the solution to the puzzle is Obama\u2019s performance in office. Many were seduced by the rhetoric of \u201chope\u201d and \u201cchange,\u201d and deeply disillusioned by the very early discovery that the words had little substance. I don\u2019t usually agree with Sarah Palin, but she had a point when she ridiculed this hopey-changey stuff. A fair number of Obama voters, mostly working people, switched to Trump. These developments were already clear by the time of the 2010 special election in Massachusetts to fill the seat of Senator Kennedy \u2013 the liberal lion. Virtually unknown Scott Brown won the election, the first Republican elected to the Senate in [more than] 40 years in this liberal state. Analysis of the vote showed that even union members hardly supported his liberal opponent because of anger at Obama: the way he handled the housing-financial crisis (bailing out the rich, including the perpetrators, while letting their victims hang out to dry) and much else, including provisions of his health care proposal that working people saw, with justice, as an attack on health programs that they had won in contract negotiations. Quite apart from Obama\u2019s disappointing policies, he and the [Democratic] Party were victims of the intense racism that is deeply rooted in large parts of American society. The visceral hatred of Obama cannot be explained in other terms. But there is far more than that. For some time, candidates for Republican primaries who emerged from the base have been far off the traditional spectrum. The establishment was able to suppress them and gain their own candidate, but that didn\u2019t change the basis for their support. For years, both parties have drifted to the right \u2014 the Republicans off the spectrum of normal parliamentary politics. Their dedication to wealth and corporate power is so extreme that they cannot get votes on their actual policies \u2014 which are now being revealed to us daily \u2014 and so have had to mobilize a voting base on issues unrelated to their service to their actual constituency. These include religious fundamentalism \u2014 a major phenomenon in the US unlike other developed societies \u2014 white supremacy, xenophobia and other latent anti-social attitudes that tend to break through to the surface during periods of disillusionment and distress. This is partly a matter of \u201csearch for scapegoats,\u201d the actual sources concealed in the usual manner of propaganda; thus, the public vastly exaggerates the number of immigrants, even more than in Europe. In the current period, these malignant tendencies are natural consequences of the harsh neoliberal policies that we have discussed before. We see much the same in Europe, for similar reasons. Trump has had overwhelming support among whites and less educated sectors, but for the most part, his mass voting base is relatively affluent and privileged. A recent Pew poll of Trump approvers found two-thirds are either college graduates, women or nonwhite, the last group apparently not many. Trump\u2019s roughly 90 percent support among Republicans is actually not unusual for an incumbent party at this stage in office \u2014 about the same as Obama among Democrats, though the fervor and passion are different, presumably reflecting the general atmosphere of anger, hatred and fear. And frightening. Recognizing the great differences, I still can\u2019t repress childhood memories of hearing Hitler\u2019s Nuremberg rallies on the radio, not understanding the words, though the mood was unmistakable. For the actual Republican constituency of wealth and corporate power, these are glory days, so why object, even if his antics sometimes cause some grimaces? The core constituency of Evangelicals is solidly in Trump\u2019s pocket, thanks to the crumbs thrown their way. Many working people maintain the illusion that Trump cares about them and will bring back lost days of steady jobs in mining and manufacturing. Even those realistic enough to dismiss this act at least see someone who is standing up to the \u201cforeign devils\u201d who have been \u201crobbing us,\u201d and in particular, the cultural elites that regard them and their values with contempt, just \u201cdeplorables.\u201d Mostly farce, but [also] much successful propaganda, with enough elements of truth to be persuasive \u2014 for a while at least. It\u2019s revealing to take a closer look at attitudes of the huge Evangelical community. According to a study by the Public Religion Research Institute, \u201cIn 2011, only 30 percent believed that personal immorality was consistent with an ethical performance of official duties. Today, 72 percent of white evangelicals \u2014 up an astounding 42 points \u2014 believe that the two can go together.\u201d No comment needed, but instructive. Trump himself seems to be having the time of his life. He\u2019s constantly in the limelight, his loyal base worships his every move, he\u2019s free to defy convention, to insult anyone he chooses, to disrupt the international economic and political order at will \u2014 whatever comes to mind next, knowing that he\u2019s the biggest thug on the block and can probably get away with it \u2014 again, for a while, at least. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite fair, however, to call him a liar. Lying presupposes having a concept of truth, and being in a situation where telling the truth matters. We don\u2019t say that three-year-olds are lying if they say they saw a dragon outside, or an actor in a play. It\u2019s also not clear that it\u2019s tactically useful to tot up the random falsehoods that pepper his tweets and orations. That just fires up his worshipful base, providing more evidence that the hated liberal elites are trying to destroy the one guy in the political arena who is dedicated to defending the common folk \u2014 who he is shafting, with delight, at every opportunity. It\u2019s an intriguing spectacle, and not a little worrisome."

    "output": "There are no deals with others of any note, but there are real accomplishments. The most heralded one is the tax bill, a very welcome gift to the actual [corporate] constituency, with the side benefit of expanding the deficit and thus offering the opportunity to dismantle the limited social programs, which are [deemed] a nuisance, dispensable, since they raise the taxes of the actual constituency and do not benefit them. Steps are already underway to weaken these programs further. That includes the steady dismantling of protections provided by the hated \u201cObamacare.\u201d I\u2019ve often wondered whether the term itself might have caught on because of implicit racism; we didn\u2019t call Medicare \u201cJohnsoncare.\u201d scathing report of the [UN] \u201cSpecial Rapporteur [Philip Alston] on extreme poverty and human rights\u201d on his mission to the United States of America, recently released, was well-timed \u2014 and may have been the immediate reason for the US withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council, which discredited itself by revealing improper truths about ourselves, just as the World Court discredited itself \u2014 and was roundly condemned by elite opinion \u2014 for daring to condemn the US for international terrorism (\u201cunlawful use of force\u201d) in the murderous Reaganite attack on Nicaragua. Other gifts to the actual constituency are being offered regularly. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is being rendered toothless. Betsy DeVos is making it easier for the for-profit colleges she cherishes to cheat students, part of the concerted corporate-led campaign to dismantle public education, one of the real contributions of the US to contemporary civilization. The Department of Labor\u2019s fiduciary rule, designed to ensure that financial advisers act in the best interest of clients, has been sent to the ashcan, along with Dodd-Frank restrictions on the actions of banks, which are already enjoying record profits with more to come as the effects of the tax scam are felt. Bulging profits were heralded as a spur to investment, of which there is scarcely a trace as they are used to enrich the rich still further. In general, things are proceeding quite well for \u201cthose who matter,\u201d though they have some concerns that Trump\u2019s erratic trade policies might infringe on the interests of the investor class. I\u2019ve skipped foreign policy, and have omitted so far, the most important accomplishments \u2014 astonishingly, commonly ignored by the opposition party and media commentary. Pride of place goes to the quite successful efforts to escalate the very severe and not remote threat of global warming. Expansion and modernization of the huge military system and provocative actions at the Russian border are not far behind. In brief, there are no meaningful deals, though there surely are impressive accomplishments."

    "input": "In some ways, as you have previously pointed out yourself, the most impressive aspect about recent developments on the US political landscape was the Bernie Sanders phenomenon, which represented a clear indication that the base of the Democratic Party had moved unmistakably to the left. Is the Sanders phenomenon \u2014 or at least the elements that gave rise to it \u2014 over? And how difficult is it for a new political party to emerge that advocates a progressive economic, social and foreign policy agenda?",
    "output": "The Sanders phenomenon was striking in two ways. One, as you mention, is the sign that the popular base of the party has moved to the left and gave impressive support to a candidate with social democratic, New Deal-style commitments \u2014 a breath of fresh air in the current state of affairs. The second was the sharp break from a long political history of pretty much bought elections. The phenomenon is by no means over. Sanders emerged as the most popular political figure in the country. In a functioning democracy, his voice \u2014 which continues to be loud and clear \u2014 would reach a wide public through mainstream media. Not here, where it is scarcely heard. Nevertheless, the offshoots of his campaign, Our Revolution, are doing important work, joining others in creating what might become stable and effective popular movements. The barriers are not insuperable, but to overcome them will require large-scale and effective organization based on popular mass movements. A lot has to be done to overcome the demolition of unions and atomization of society during the neoliberal years under the Thatcherite slogan \u201cyou know, there\u2019s no such thing as society\u201d \u2014 unwittingly echoing Marx\u2019s bitter condemnation of authoritarian rulers who want to turn society into \u201ca sack of potatoes,\u201d isolated individuals incapable of confronting concentrated economic and political power.The US political system has serious flaws, among them very high structural barriers for forming a new party. The last political party to have reached the mainstream is the Republican Party, but those were very different days. Where there is proportional representation, new parties can find a place in the political system, and have a chance to become major players \u2014 the British Labour Party, for example. In the US, even formal balloting procedures, run by state legislatures, virtually restrict participation to the two parties. Furthermore, the political parties are not membership organizations; rather, they are candidate-producing machines. There are serious tasks ahead for those who aspire to a livable world."

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: In our last interview, you analyzed the political identity of today\u2019s Republican Party and dissected its strategy for returning to power. Here, I am interested in your thoughts on the current shape of the Democratic Party and, more specifically, on whether it is in the midst of loosening its embrace of neoliberalism to such an extent that an ideological metamorphosis may in fact be underway?",
    "output": "The short answer is: Maybe. There is much uncertainty. With all of the major differences, the current situation is somewhat reminiscent of the early 1930s, which I\u2019m old enough to remember, if hazily. We may recall Antonio Gramsci\u2019s famous observation from Mussolini\u2019s prison in 1930, applicable to the state of the world at the time, whatever exactly he may have had in mind: \u201cThe crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.\u201d Today, the foundations of the neoliberal doctrines that have had such a brutal effect on the population and the society are tottering, and might collapse. And there is no shortage of morbid symptoms. In the years that followed Gramsci\u2019s comment, two paths emerged to deal with the deep crisis of the 1930s: social democracy, pioneered by the New Deal in the U.S., and fascism. We have not reached that state, but symptoms of both paths are apparent, in no small measure on party lines. To assess the current state of the political system, it is useful to go back a little. In the 1970s, the highly class-conscious business community sharply escalated its efforts to dismantle New Deal social democracy and the \u201cregimented capitalism\u201d that prevailed through the postwar period \u2014 the fastest growth period of American state capitalism, egalitarian, with financial institutions under control so there were none of the crises that punctuate the neoliberal years and no \u201cbailout economy\u201d of the kind that has prevailed through these years, as Robert Pollin and Gerald Epstein very effectively review. The business attack begins in the late 1930s with experiments in what later became a major industry of \u201cscientific methods of strike-breaking.\u201d It was on hold during the war and took off immediately afterwards, but it was relatively limited until the 1970s. The political parties pretty much followed suit; more accurately perhaps, the two factions of the business party that share government in the U.S. one-party state. By the \u201870s, beginning with Nixon\u2019s overtly racist \u201cSouthern strategy,\u201d the Republicans began their journey off the political spectrum, culminating (so far) in the McConnell-Trump era of contempt for democracy as an impediment to holding uncontested power. Meanwhile, the Democrats abandoned the working class, handing working people over to their class enemy. The Democrats transitioned to a party of affluent professionals and Wall Street, becoming \u201ccool\u201d under Obama in a kind of replay of the infatuation of liberal intellectuals with the Camelot image contrived in the Kennedy years. The last gasp of real Democratic concern for working people was the 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins full employment act. President Carter, who seemed to have had little interest in workers\u2019 rights and needs, didn\u2019t veto the bill, but watered it down so that it had no teeth. In the same year, UAW president Doug Fraser withdrew from Carter\u2019s Labor-Management committee, condemning business leaders \u2014 belatedly \u2014 for having \u201cchosen to wage a one-sided class war ... against working people, the unemployed, the poor, the minorities, the very young and the very old, and even many in the middle class of our society.\u201d The one-sided class war took off in force under Ronald Reagan. Like his accomplice Margaret Thatcher in England, Reagan understood that the first step should be to eliminate the enemy\u2019s means of defense by harsh attack on unions, opening the door for the corporate world to follow, with the Democrats largely indifferent or participating in their own ways \u2014 matters we\u2019ve discussed before. The tragi-comic effects are being played out in Washington right now. Biden attempted to pass badly needed support for working people who have suffered a terrible blow during the pandemic (while billionaires profited handsomely and the stock market boomed). He ran into a solid wall of implacable Republican opposition. A major issue was how to pay for it. Republicans indicated some willingness to agree to the relief efforts if the costs were borne by unemployed workers by reducing the pittance of compensation. But they imposed an unbreachable Red Line: not a penny from the very rich. Nothing can touch Trump\u2019s major legislative achievement, the 2017 tax scam that enriches the super-rich and corporate sector at the expense of everyone else \u2014 the bill that Joseph Stiglitz termed the U.S. Donor Relief Act of 2017, which \u201cembodies all that is wrong with the Republican Party, and to some extent, the debased state of American democracy.\u201d Meanwhile, Republicans claim to be the party of the working class, thanks to their advocacy of lots of guns for everyone, Christian nationalism and white supremacy \u2014 our \u201ctraditional way of life.\u201d To Biden\u2019s credit, he has made moves to reverse the abandonment of working people by his party, but in the \u201cdebased state\u201d of what remains of American democracy, it\u2019s a tough call. The Democrats are meanwhile split between the management of the affluent professional/Wall Street-linked party, still holding most of the reins, and a large and energetic segment of the popular base that has been pressing for social democratic initiatives to deal with the ravages of the 40-year bipartisan neoliberal assault \u2014 and among some of the popular base, a lot more. The internal conflict has been sharp for years, particularly as the highly successful Sanders campaign began to threaten absolute control by the Clinton-Obama party managers, who tried in every way to sabotage his candidacy. We see that playing out again right now in the intense efforts to block promising left candidates in Buffalo and the Cleveland area in northeast Ohio. We should bear in mind the peculiarities of political discourse in the U.S. Elsewhere, \u201csocialist\u201d is about as controversial as \u201cDemocrat\u201d is here, and policies described as \u201cmaybe good but too radical for Americans\u201d are conventional. That\u2019s true, for example, of the two main programs that Bernie Sanders championed: universal health care and free higher education. The economics columnist and associate editor of the LondonFinancial Times, Rana Foroohar, hardly exaggerated when she wrote that while Sanders is considered the spokesperson of the radical left here, \u201cin terms of his policies, he\u2019s probably pretty close to your average German Christian Democrat,\u201d the German conservative party in a generally conservative political system. On issues, the split between the party managers and progressive sectors of the voting base is pretty much across the board. It is not limited to the relics of social welfare but to a range of other crucial matters, among them, the most important issue that has ever arisen in human history, along with nuclear weapons: the destruction of the environment that sustains life, proceeding apace. We might tarry a moment to think about this. The most recent general assessment of where we stand comes from a leaked draft of the forthcoming IPCC study on the state of the environment. According to the report of the study, it \u201cconcludes that climate change will fundamentally reshape life on Earth in the coming decades, even if humans can tame planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Species extinction, more widespread disease, unlivable heat, ecosystem collapse, cities menaced by rising seas \u2014 these and other devastating climate impacts are accelerating and bound to become painfully obvious before a child born today turns 30.... On current trends, we\u2019re heading for three degrees Celsius at best.\u201d Thanks to activist efforts, notably of the Sunrise movement, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey have been able to introduce a congressional resolution on a Green New Deal that spells out quite carefully what can and must be done. Further popular pressures could move it towards proposed legislation. It is likely to meet an iron wall of resistance from the denialist party, which increasingly is dedicated to the principle enunciated in 1936 by Francisco Franco\u2019s companion, the fascist general Mill\u00e1n Astray: \u201cAbajo la inteligencia! Viva la muerte!\u201d: \u201cDown with intelligence! Viva death.\u201d As of now, the Democratic response would be mixed. The president refuses to support a Green New Deal, a prerequisite for decent survival. Many in Congress, too. That can change, and must. A lot will depend on the coming election. While all of this is going on here, OPEC is meeting, and is riven by conflicts over how much toincreaseoil production, with the White House pressuring for increased production to lower prices and Saudi Arabia worrying that if prices rise it \u201cwould accelerate the shift toward renewable energy\u201d \u2014 that is, toward saving human society from catastrophe, a triviality not mentioned in the news report, as usual. Going back to the crisis of 90 years ago, as the neoliberal assault faces increasingly angry resistance, we see signs of something like the two paths taken then: a drift toward proto-fascism or creation of genuine social democracy. Each tendency can of course proceed further, reawakening Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s warning \u201cSocialism or Barbarism.\u201d It is useful to recall that the primary intellectual forces behind the neoliberal assault have a long history of support for fascism. Just a few years before the assault was launched, they had conducted an experiment in neoliberal socio-economic management under the aegis of the Pinochet dictatorship, which prepared the ground by destroying labor and dispatching critics to hideous torture chambers or instant death. Under near-perfect experimental conditions, they managed to crash the economy in a few years, but no matter. On to greater heights: imposing the doctrine on the world. In earlier years, their guru, Ludwig von Mises, was overjoyed by the triumph of fascism, which he claimed had \u201csaved European civilization,\u201d exulting, \u201cThe merit that Fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history.\u201d Mussolini\u2019s \u201cachievement\u201d was much like Pinochet\u2019s: destroying labor and independent thought so that \u201csound economics\u201d could proceed unencumbered by sentimental concerns about human rights and justice. In defense of von Mises, we may recall that he was far from alone in admiring Mussolini\u2019s achievements, though few sank to his depths of adulation. In his case, on principled grounds. All worth recalling when we consider the possible responses to the neoliberal disaster."

    "output": "The best way is by designing and implementing policies that will help people and benefit the country. Biden\u2019s programs so far move in that direction \u2014 not enough, but significantly. Such efforts would show that under decent leadership, impelled by popular pressure, reform can improve lives, alleviate distress, satisfy some human needs. That would expand the Democratic base, just as social-democratic New Deal-style measures have done in the past. The Republican leadership understands that very well. That is why they will fight tooth and nail against any measures to improve life, with strict party discipline. We have been witnessing this for years. One of many illustrations is the dedication to block the very limited improvement of the scandalous U.S. health care system in the Affordable Care Act \u2014 \u201cObamacare.\u201d Another is the sheer cruelty of Republican governors who refuse federal aid to provide desperate people even with meager Medicaid assistance. That\u2019s one way to expand the base, which could have large effects if it can break through Republican opposition and the reluctance of the more right-wing sectors of the Democratic Party (termed \u201cmoderate\u201d in media discourse). It could bring back to the Democratic fold the working-class voters who left in disgust with Obama\u2019s betrayals, and further back, with the Democrats\u2019 abandonment of working people since the reshaping of the party from the \u201870s. There are other opportunities. Working people and communities that depend on the fossil fuel economy can be reached by taking seriously their concerns and working with them to develop transitional programs that will provide them with better jobs and better lives with renewable energy. That\u2019s no idle dream. Such initiatives have had substantial success in coal-mining and oil-producing states, thanks in considerable measure to Bob Pollin\u2019s grassroots work. There is no mystery about how to extend the base: pursue policies that serve peoples\u2019 interests, not the preferences of the donor class."

Where Mexican-American communities were ignored, as in South Texas, Trump broke records in Latino support. There seem to be several reasons. People resented being taken for granted by the Democratic Party (\u201cYou\u2019re Latino, so you\u2019re in our pocket\u201d). There was no effort to provide the constructive alternative to the Republican claim that global warming is a liberal hoax and the Democrats want to take your jobs away.

If Democrats were to resort to filibuster, McConnell, who is no fool, might well find ways to use illegal procedures to ram through acts that would establish more firmly the rule of the far right, whatever the population might prefer. We saw that illustrated recently in his shenanigans with the Garland-Gorsuch Supreme Court appointments, but it goes far back. Political analyst Michael Tomasky argued recently, quite seriously, that the Senate should be abolished, converted to something like the British House of Lords, with a peripheral role in governance. There has always been an argument for that, and with the evisceration of remaining shreds of democracy under Republican leadership, it is an idea whose time may have come, at least as a goal for the future."

With that in mind, what do you consider to be the issues of paramount importance that progressives, both activists and lawmakers, must work on in order to bring about meaningful reform that would improve average people\u2019s lives, as well as enhance the prospects of a democratic future?",
    "output": "For good reason, the gold standard in scholarship on the Constitutional Convention, by Michael Klarman, is entitled \u201cThe Framer\u2019s Coup\u201d \u2014 meaning, the coup against democracy by a distinguished group of wealthy, white, (mostly) slave owners. There were a few dissidents \u2014 Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson (who did not take part in the Convention). But the rest were pretty much in agreement that democracy was a threat that had to be avoided. The Constitution was carefully designed to undercut the threat. The call for plutocracy was not concealed. Madison\u2019s vision, largely enacted, was that the new government should \u201cprotect the minority of the opulent against the majority.\u201d Many devices were introduced to ensure this outcome. Primary power was placed in the (unelected) Senate, with long terms to insulate Senators from public pressure. \u201cThe senate ought to come from and represent the wealth of the nation,\u201d Madison held, backed by his colleagues. These are the \u201cmore capable set of men,\u201d who sympathize with property owners and their rights. In simple words, \u201cthose who own the country ought to govern it,\u201d as explained by John Jay, First Justice of the Supreme Court. In short, plutocracy. In Madison\u2019s defense, it should be recalled that his mentality was pre-capitalist. Scholarship recognizes that Madison \u201cwas \u2014 to depths that we today are barely able to imagine \u2014 an eighteenth century gentleman of honor,\u201d in the words of Lance Banning. It is the \u201cenlightened Statesman\u201d and \u201cbenevolent philosopher\u201d who were to exercise power. They would be \u201cmen of intelligence, patriotism, property and independent circumstances,\u201d and \u201cpure and noble\u201d like the Romans of the imagination of the time; men \u201cwhose wisdom may best discern the true interests of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations.\u201d They would thus \u201crefine\u201d and \u201cenlarge\u201d the \u201cpublic views,\u201d Banning continues, guarding the public interest against the \u201cmischiefs\u201d of democratic majorities. The picture is richly confirmed in the fascinating debates of the Convention. It has ample resonance to the present, quite strikingly in the most respected liberal democratic theory. Madison himself was soon disabused of these myths. In a 1791 letter to Jefferson, he deplored \u201cthe daring depravity of the times\u201d as the \u201cstockjobbers will become the pretorian band of the government \u2014 at once its tools and its tyrant; bribed by its largesses, and overawing it by clamors and combinations.\u201d Not a bad picture of America today. The contours have been sharpened by 40 years of bipartisan neoliberalism, now challenged by the progressive base that Democratic Party managers are working to subdue. With all its anti-democratic features, by 18th-century standards, the American constitutional system was a significant step toward freedom and democracy, enough so as to seriously frighten European statesmen who perceived the potential domino effect of subversive republicanism. The world has changed. The plutocracy remains in place, a terrain of struggle. Over time, popular struggles have expanded the realm of freedom, justice and democratic participation, not without regression. There are many barriers that remain to be demolished in the political system and the general social order: bought elections, the \u201cbailout economy,\u201d structural racism and other attacks on basic rights, suppression of labor. It is all too easy to extend the list and to spell out more radical goals that should be guidelines for the future, all overshadowed by the imminent threats to survival."

    "input": "The pandemic and the inadequacy or collapse not only of health systems but also economies have shown that the perception of society as a business model has failed. Neo-liberalism and homo economicus leaders such as Donald Trump have shown that they cannot face a social crisis in business terms. How obvious do you think this is to American and global public opinion? And what impact will it have on the US election? Can we hope for a progressive radicalization as a progressive response?",
    "output": "The pandemic is a vivid illustration of the great damage that the neoliberal era has done to the large majority of the population. We should, however, have no illusions about belief in markets or homo economicus. The core principle of neoliberalism is to shift decisions from governments, which are to some extent subject to public influence, to private tyrannies that are completely unaccountable to the public \u2013 and according to neoliberal doctrine, must be devoted solely to self-enrichment. As soon as they gained greater power under Reagan, Thatcher, and the like, they rapidly reshaped markets to their own advantage. And of course they depend very heavily on public subsidies and bailouts when they cause crises, once again today. But the illusions nevertheless have some relation to reality. The pandemic derives from deep failures of capitalism exacerbated by the impact of its savage neoliberal version. In 2003, after the SARS epidemic was contained, scientists warned that another coronavirus epidemic was likely and outlined ways to prepare for it. But knowledge is not enough. Someone has to act on it. The obvious choice is Big Pharma, bloated with gifts from the public thanks to the devices of neoliberal globalization. But that is barred by capitalist logic: It is not profitable to prepare for future catastrophes. That leaves government, which is in fact responsible for the basic work in developing most vaccines and drugs. But that is blocked by neoliberal doctrine: Government is the problem, as Reagan intoned. So nothing was done. The business model imposed more wreckage. Hospitals run on this model do not waste resources on spare capacity, like extra beds. That more or less works in normal times, but quickly causes catastrophe in an emergency. That is the bare beginning. In general, it is quite correct to describe the pandemic as a capitalist catastrophe, exacerbated by neoliberal savagery. Is this understood by most of the population? Probably not. It would be hard to find any mention of the fundamental matters in what reaches the general public. It is of course understood that the system has collapsed, engendering anger, resentment, disdain for institutions. That provides fertile terrain for far-right demagogues like Trump. It can also lead to constructive efforts to cure the maladies and construct a more free and just world. There are opportunities. One, with great promise, is the newly formed Progressive International, initiated by Bernie Sanders\u2019 movement in the US along with Yanis Varoufakis and DiEM25 in Europe, now also bringing in important elements of the Global South. But just as knowledge has to be used, so opportunities have to be grasped."

We should not forget, however, that the pandemic is far from the most severe crisis that we face. There will be recovery from the pandemic, at terrible cost. There will be no recovery from the melting of the polar ice caps and the heating of the world that may lead to much of it becoming literally uninhabitable even before the end of this century, all with consequences that are unimaginable. As in the case of the pandemic, here too the logic of capitalism is at work. And here too its threat to the survival of humanity is sharply intensified by malignant elements at the center of global power. The Trump administration is dedicated with such fervor to its constituency of extreme wealth and corporate power that it is maximizing the use of fossil fuels and dismantling the regulatory system that provides at least some time to reverse course and avert catastrophe.

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: Noam, the U.S.-China relationship has gone through ups and downs over the course of the last 30 or so years. Clearly, the sort of relationship that exists today between the two countries is far more antagonistic than it was even 10 years ago. In your own view, what forces or processes are responsible for the increasing tensions we are witnessing today in U.S.-China relations?",
    "output": "After the fall of the USSR, there was much euphoria about the end of history with \u201cliberal democracy\u201d (a code word for the U.S.) having achieved total victory. A corollary was that China could now be brought within the \u201crule-based international order.\u201d The latter is a now-conventional phrase, one worth pondering. It refers to an international order in which the U.S. sets the rules, displacing the international order established by the United Nations, which the U.S. deems antiquated and irrelevant. The UN Charter is the Supreme Law of the Land under the U.S. Constitution, constantly violated, a matter of no concern to those who pledge reverence for the Holy Text. Its provisions have been considered inappropriate for the modern world ever since the U.S. lost control of the UN with decolonization, and occasional backsliding among the privileged as well. UN members no longer know \u201chow to play,\u201d to borrow Thomas Friedman\u2019s ridicule of France when it failed to support the benign U.S. invasion of Iraq, accompanied by his call for the miscreant to be deprived of its permanent membership in the Security Council. The self-described \u201cworld\u2019s greatest deliberative body\u201d contented itself with renaming French fries as \u201cFreedom fries\u201d in the Senate cafeteria. Right-thinking people understand that the outdated UN-based international order is to be replaced by the rule-based order, including such constructions as the highly protectionist \u201cfree-trade agreements,\u201d right now yielding such pleasures as barring a \u201cpeople\u2019s vaccine\u201d that would alleviate the COVID disaster. The Clintonites were particularly enthusiastic about incorporating a well-disciplined China within this forward-looking rule-based order. It didn\u2019t work as planned. China refuses to play when it doesn\u2019t want to. Worse still, it can\u2019t be intimidated. It goes its own way. That way is often ugly, but that\u2019s of no relevance to the rule-based order, which easily tolerates vicious crimes by the righteous \u2014 notably the Master \u2014 with equanimity and often approval. China is not Europe. The countries of Europe may fume when the U.S. decides to destroy the joint agreement with Iran (the JCPOA) and to impose harsh sanctions to punish Iran for Washington\u2019s demolition of the agreement. They may even proclaim that they will develop ways to avoid the murderous U.S. sanctions. But in the end, they go along, not willing to incur the wrath of the Godfather, or his punitive measures, such as expulsion from the international financial system, controlled by Washington. Same in many other cases. China is different. It insists on the UN-based system (which it violates when it chooses to). As former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating explained, the much-heralded \u201cChina threat\u201d reduces to the fact that China exists and is successfully defying the rules. It is not the first to do so. The charge of \u201csuccessful defiance\u201d comes from the annals of the U.S. State Department in the 1960s. It was directed against the \u201cCuban threat,\u201d namely, Cuba\u2019s \u201csuccessful defiance\u201d of U.S. policies dating back to the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which declared Washington\u2019s intention to dominate the hemisphere once the British nuisance had been removed. That was anticipated by the great grand strategist John Quincy Adams, intellectual author of Manifest Destiny. He instructed his cabinet colleagues that U.S. power would increase while Britain\u2019s declined, so that Cuba (indeed the hemisphere) would fall into U.S. hands by the laws of \u201cpolitical gravitation\u201d as an apple falls from a tree. That happened in 1898 when the U.S. intervened to prevent Cuba\u2019s liberation from Spanish rule, turning Cuba into a virtual colony, events recorded in properly sanitized history as Washington\u2019s \u201cliberation\u201d of Cuba. Cuba has been punished viciously for this successful defiance, including John F. Kennedy\u2019s terrorist war, which almost brought about terminal nuclear war, and a crushing blockade. U.S. punishment of Cuba is opposed by the whole world: 184-2 in the latest UN vote, with Israel alone voting with its U.S. protector. But Europe obeys, however reluctantly. Sometimes China\u2019s practices sink to almost indescribable depths of evil. Once Washington realized that China is successfully defying the rules, it turned to the project of impeding China\u2019s technological development \u2014 harming itself in the process, but overcoming the \u201cChina threat\u201d is of transcendent importance. One aspect of the campaign to impede Chinese development is to keep others from using Chinese technology. But the devious Chinese are defying the rule-based international order by \u201csetting up a network of vocational colleges around the world [to] train students in dozens of countries in technical areas ... on Chinese technology with Chinese standards as part of a full court press to globalize Chinese tech. It is a component of a bigger effort to tighten the economic linkages between China and the Global South, which Beijing sees as key to competition with the United States,\u201d according to foreign policy scholars Niva Yau and Dirk van der Kley. Worse still, they note, \u201cthe Chinese government has been willing to listen to host countries,\u201d and is training local instructors who will upgrade the skills of the local trainees and be able to develop their own societies, within the Chinese orbit and using Chinese technology. These projects fall within the broader Chinese global policy framework now being realized most extensively throughout Eurasia, probably soon reaching to Turkey and on to Eastern and Central Europe. If Afghanistan can survive U.S. sanctions, it too will probably be brought within the orbit of the China-based Shanghai Cooperation Organization, joining Russia, India, Pakistan, Iran and the Central Asian states. China might manage to shift Afghanistan\u2019s economy from opium export, the staple when it was under U.S. control, to exploiting its considerable mineral resources, to China\u2019s benefit. Chinese economic initiatives also extend to Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East (including Israel) and even to Washington\u2019s backyard in Latin America, despite strenuous U.S. efforts to block such intrusion. Critics of these initiatives \u201caccuse China of pursuing a policy of \u2018debt-trap diplomacy\u2019: luring poor, developing countries into agreeing [to] unsustainable loans to pursue infrastructure projects so that, when they experience financial difficulty, Beijing can seize the asset, thereby extending its strategic or military reach.\u201d Perhaps, but the charges are contested by reputable Western sources, including a Chatham House study that \u201cdemonstrates that the evidence for such views is limited,\u201d and studies by U.S. researchers assert that these charges, including those leveled by Donald Trump and Mike Pompeo, are baseless and that, \u201cChinese banks are willing to restructure the terms of existing loans and have never actually seized an asset from any country,\u201d in particular, the prize example in the charges, a port in Sri Lanka. Nonetheless, debt traps are a concern, one that the U.S. understands well. Right now, for example, Washington is deeply concerned about a debt trap afflicting Cambodia, which is under pressure to repay a loan as it easily can, the lender claims, also arguing that it \u201cwould set a bad precedent for other states\u201d if the debt were cancelled. The lender is, of course, Washington. The debt was incurred by the government the U.S. was supporting (or more realistically, had imposed), in the early 1970s, when official U.S. policy, in Henry Kissinger\u2019s immortal words, was \u201cmassive bombing campaign in Cambodia.... Anything that flies on anything that moves,\u201d a call for genocide that would be hard to match in the archival record. The consequences were, predictably, horrendous. The perpetrator is greatly honored. The victims must repay their debts. We wouldn\u2019t want to set a bad precedent. Occasionally, depravity reaches such a level that words fail. The report on Cambodia\u2019s debt trap adds that, \u201cif Washington were to wipe out a large chunk of the debt, it would only do so if it believed this gesture was met by good-faith reciprocity from Phnom Penh. Frankly, there\u2019s zero reason for such a belief now. A case in point occurred last month, when, after [U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy] Sherman\u2019s visit to Phnom Penh, the Cambodian government allowed the defense attach\u00e9 at the U.S. Embassy, Marcus M. Ferrara, to tour the Ream Naval Base.... Yet he turned up to find that he was only allowed to visit parts of the site. Phnom Penh was in its rights to limit Ferrara\u2019s visit, yet it did nothing to absolve U.S. fears that Cambodia is hiding something.\u201d It might be hiding a deal with China, which never ceases its malevolence. As we have discussed earlier, much of the frenzied rhetoric about the China threat concerns alleged threats off the coast of China, where the U.S. military advantage is overwhelming (and a small fraction of the U.S. military advantage worldwide). That was so even before the recent U.S.-U.K. decision to provide Australia with a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines to confront China\u2019s four old noisy diesel submarines bottled up by U.S. power in the South China Sea. The U.S. claims to be defending freedom of navigation with its military maneuvers in China\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone \u2014 pure fraud, as we have already discussed. There are actually serious issues concerning Chinese abuses of the Law of the Sea, which has been ratified by all maritime powers except one: the usual outlier, the U.S. These should be addressed by diplomacy led by the regional powers, not by highly provocative acts that increase the threat of escalation to full-scale war."

    "input": "Taiwan has returned as one of the thorniest issues in U.S.-Chinese relations. The Chinese military has stepped up its activities in the Taiwan Strait and, according to some military experts, is even acquiring the equipment necessary for an invasion. In fact, Taipei has warned that China is getting ready to invade the island by 2025, although one would have to assume that such a scenario is most unlikely because of the impact that it would have on China\u2019s relations with the rest of the world. Still, would it be likely, as president Biden stated in late October during aCNN\u201ctown hall,\u201d that the U.S. would defend Taiwan if China invaded? And is there really a \u201cTaiwan agreement\u201d between the U.S. and China, as Biden also seems to have suggested earlier in that month?",
    "output": "The critical agreement is the \u201cone-China\u201d doctrine that has been held for over 40 years. It is kept ambiguous. The rational policy now is for both the U.S. and China to refrain from provocative acts, and for Taiwan to adhere to the ambiguous agreement, the best outcome that can be hoped for at this point."

    "input": "As China is bent on expanding its nuclear arsenal, the U.S. appears willing now to push for arms-control talks. What are the lessons from the Cold War era to help us feel confident that a U.S.-China arms race can be prevented?",
    "output": "The main lesson from the Cold War era is that it\u2019s a virtual miracle that we have survived. There should be no need here to run through the record once again, but it is worth remembering how many opportunities to reduce the dangers radically were lost. The most instructive case I think was 60 years ago. Nikita Khrushchev understood well that Russia could not carry out the economic development he hoped for if it was trapped in an arms race with a far richer and more powerful adversary. He therefore proposed sharp mutual reductions in offensive weapons. The incoming Kennedy administration considered the offer and rejected it, instead turning to rapid military expansion, even though it was already far in the lead. The prominent international relations scholar Kenneth Waltz described what happened at the time: the Kennedy administration \u201cundertook the largest strategic and conventional peace-time military build-up the world has yet seen ... even as Khrushchev was trying at once to carry through a major reduction in the conventional forces and to follow a strategy of minimum deterrence, and we did so even though the balance of strategic weapons greatly favored the United States.\u201d As often has been the case, the policy harmed national security while enhancing state power, what really matters to Washington. By now it\u2019s widely recognized \u2014 including a joint statement by Henry Kissinger, Reagan\u2019s Secretary of State George Shultz, the Senate\u2019s leading specialist on armaments Sam Nunn and former Secretary of Defense William Perry \u2014 that we should move expeditiously to eliminate nuclear weapons, a process that the signers of the nonproliferation treaty are obligated to undertake. The UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons entered into force this year. Though not yet implemented because of U.S. interference, nuclear weapons-free zones have been established in much of the world. In brief, there are ways to greatly enhance security. China so far has held back in nuclear weapons development. It would be wise to continue this policy. The U.S. can facilitate it by ending its highly provocative actions and moving towards an arms-control agreement with China. There are feasible means, outlined by arms control specialists. While the Republican administrations since 2000 have been dismantling the arms control regime that has been laboriously constructed over the past 60 years, even Trump\u2019s wrecking ball didn\u2019t manage to demolish all of them; Biden was able to rescue the New Start Treaty just before its expiration. The system can be resurrected and carried forward to the point where this scourge is removed from the Earth. The essential conclusion is simple: either the U.S. and China will work together on the critical issues that we all face, or they will expire together, bringing the rest of the world down with them."

    "input": "Interestingly enough, while Trump seeks to appease his political doppelg\u00e4nger in Pyongyang, he has succeeded in alienating most of the US\u2019s major Western allies, including Canada, France and Germany. Is this the consequence of his alleged foreign policy doctrine \u201cWe are America, bitch\u201d?",
    "output": "There are extensive efforts to try to discern some coherent doctrine that guides Trump\u2019s behavior, but I suspect it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand. A very good predictor of Trump policy is [his fixation on] ... reversing anything associated with the despised \u201cKenyan Muslim\u201d he replaced: in foreign policy, tearing up the successful Iran deal and accepting the long-standing possibilities for addressing the serious North Korea crisis (proclaiming to have created an astonishing breakthrough). Much the same is true of other actions that look like random shots when the driving forces are ignored. All of this has to be done while satisfying the usual Republican constituencies: primarily the business world and the rich. For Trump, that also means unleashing the more brutal wing of the Republican Party so that they can dedicate themselves even beyond the norm to the interest of private wealth and corporate power. Here the technique is to capture the media with attention-grabbing antics, which can be solemnly exposed while the game goes on \u2014 so far, quite effectively. Then comes the task of controlling the so-called \u201cpopulist\u201d base: the angry, frightened, disillusioned white population, primarily males. Since there is no way for Trumpism to deal with their economic concerns, which are actually being exacerbated by current policy-formation, it\u2019s necessary to posture heroically as \u201cstanding up\u201d for them against \u201cmalevolent forces\u201d and to cater to the anti-social impulses that tend to surface when people are left to face difficult circumstances alone, without institutions and organizations to support them in their struggles. That\u2019s also being done effectively for the time being. The \u201cWe are America, bitch\u201d posture appeals to chauvinistic instincts and the white supremacy that is a deeply rooted feature of American culture and is now exacerbated by concern that whites might even become a minority. The posture can also delude working people into believing that their tough-guy protector will bring back the world they\u2019ve lost. Such propaganda exercises cannot, of course, target those actually responsible for the plight of the victims of neoliberal globalization. On the contrary, attention has to be diverted away from corporate managers who largely shape state policy while establishing complex global supply chains to maximize profit at the expense of working people. More appropriate targets are desperate people fleeing horrors for which we are largely responsible: \u201cforeigners\u201d who have been \u201crobbing us\u201d with the connivance of \u201ctreacherous liberals\u201d and other assorted devils that can be conjured up in periods of social breakdown. Allies, friends, who cares? There is no need for policies that are \u201ccoherent\u201d in any traditional sense. Consequences don\u2019t matter as long as the primary goals are met."

    "input": "After months of harsh rhetoric against China\u2019s trade practices, Trump has decided to impose tariffs of $50 billion on Chinese imports, prompting Beijing, subsequently, to declare that the US has embarked on a trade war and to announce in turn that it will retaliate with similar measures against US imports. First, isn\u2019t it true that China is merely practicing today the same sort of mercantilist policies that the US and Great Britain practiced in the past on their way to global ascendancy? Second, is the targeting of tariffs expected to have any impact either on China\u2019s economy or on the size of the US trade deficit? And lastly, if a new era of protectionism is about to take off, what could the consequences of such development be for the reign of global neoliberalism?",
    "output": "Several questions arise. First, what is Trump\u2019s motive? If it were concern about China\u2019s economic management and trade policies, he wouldn\u2019t be going out of his way to alienate allies with tariffs and insults but would be joining with them to confront China on the issues of concern. If, however, the driving force is what I discussed earlier, then targeting both China and allies with abuse and tariffs has a certain logic: It may play well in the rust belt, contributing to the delusion that our hero is fighting to ensure jobs for working people \u2014 though it\u2019s a tricky strategy, because it harms other parts of his loyal base, mainly farmers, and also, though more subtly, because it imposes a new tax on consumption, which is what tariffs amount to. As for China\u2019s economic policies, yes, they are similar to those that have been used by developed societies generally, beginning with Britain and then its former North American colony. Similar, but more limited. China lacks the means available to its predecessors. Britain stole superior technology from India, the Low Countries, Ireland, and by force and severe protectionism, undermined the Indian economy, then the world\u2019s most advanced along with China. The US, under the Hamiltonian system, resorted to high tariffs to bar superior British goods, and also took British technology in ways barred by the current US-initiated global trading system. Economic historian Paul Bairoch describes the US as \u201cthe mother country and bastion of protectionism\u201d into the 1920s, well after it had become far and away the richest country in the world. The general practice is called \u201ckicking away the ladder\u201d by economic historians: first use the practices to develop, then bar others from following. Earlier, Britain\u2019s economic development relied on large-scale piracy, now considered by its former practitioner to be the most heinous of crimes. Keynes wrote that the booty of English pirates, like the famed and admired Sir Francis Drake, \u201cmay fairly be considered the fountain and origin of British foreign investments.\u201d Piracy was also a standard practice in the American colonies. Both British and US economies also relied crucially on the most hideous system of slavery in human history. Cotton was the oil of the industrial revolution, providing the basis for manufacturing, finance, commerce, retail. Such practices are not available to China. Like Britain before it, the US called for \u201cfree trade\u201d when it recognized that the playing field was tilted properly in its direction. After World War II, when the US had incomparable power, it promoted the \u201cliberal world order\u201d that has been an enormous boon to the US corporate system, which now owns about half of the global economy, an astonishing policy success. Again, following the British model, the US hedged its commitment to \u201cfree trade\u201d for the benefit of domestic private power. The British-dominated \u201cfree trade\u201d system kept India as a largely closed protectorate. The US-dominated system imposes an extreme patent system (\u201cintellectual property\u201d) that provides virtual monopoly power to major US industries. The US government also provides huge subsidies to energy industries, agribusiness and financial institutions. While the US complains about Chinese industrial policy, the modern high-tech industry has relied crucially on research and development in the publicly subsidized sector of the economy, to such an extent that the economy might fairly be regarded as a system of public subsidy, private profit. And there are many other devices to subsidize industry. Procurement, for example, has been shown to be a significant device. In fact, the enormous military system alone, through procurement, provides a huge state subsidy to industry. These comments only skim the surface. Britain abandoned laissez-faire when it could no longer cope with Japanese competition, part of the background for World War II in the Pacific. Some in the US are having similar qualms today, concerns that Trump is cynically exploiting. But not the powerful corporate sector that relies crucially on the US-designed global economic order. The corporate sector relies so extensively on the global economy it has designed that it is sure to use its enormous power to try to head off a major trade war. The Trump tariffs and the retaliation might escalate, but it\u2019s likely that the threat will be contained. Trump is quite right, however, in proclaiming that the US would \u201cwin\u201d a limited trade war, given the scale of the US economy, the huge domestic market and unique advantages in other respects. The \u201cWe are America, bitch\u201d doctrine is a powerful weapon of intimidation."

With all this in mind, how would you describe the nature of contemporary US politics?",
    "output": "Much as in Europe, the centrist political institutions in the United States, which have long been in the driver\u2019s seat, are in decline. The reasons are not obscure. People who have endured the rigors of the neoliberal assault \u2014 austerity in the recent European version \u2014 recognize that the institutions are working for others, not for them. In the US, people do not have to read academic political science to know that a large majority, those who are not near the top of the income scale, are effectively disenfranchised, in that their own representatives pay little attention to their views, hearkening rather to the voices of the rich, the donor class. In Europe, anyone can see that basic decisions are made by the unelected Troika, in Brussels, with the northern banks peering over their shoulders. In the US, respect for Congress has long been hovering in single digits. In recent Republican primaries, when candidates emerged from the base, the Establishment was able to beat them down and obtain their own candidate. In 2016, that failed for the first time. True, it\u2019s not far from the norm for a billionaire with enormous media support and almost $1 billion in campaign funding to win an election, but Trump was hardly the choice of the Republican elites. The most spectacular result of the election was not the Trump phenomenon. Rather, it was the remarkable success of Bernie Sanders, breaking sharply with US political history. With no support from big business or the media, Sanders might well have won the Democratic nomination had it not been for the machinations of Obama-Clinton party managers. Similar processes are apparent in recent European elections. Like it or not, Trump is doing quite well. He has the support of 83 percent of Republicans, which is without precedent apart from rare moments. Whatever their feelings may be, Republicans dare not cross him openly. His general support in the low 40s is not far from the norm, about the same as Obama\u2019s going into his first midterm. He is lavishing gifts on the business world and the wealthy, the authentic constituency of the Republicans (with the Democrat leadership not far behind). He has thrown enough crumbs to keep the Evangelicals happy and has struck the right chords for racist/white supremacy elements. And he has, so far, managed to convince coal miners and steel workers that he is one of them. In fact, his support among union members has increased to 51 percent. It is hardly in doubt that Trump cares almost nothing about the fate of the country or the world. What matters isme. That\u2019s clear enough from his attitude toward global warming. He is perfectly well aware of the dire threat \u2014 to his properties. His application for a seawall to protect his Irish golf course is based explicitly on the threat of global warming. But pursuit of power impels him to lead the race to destruction, quite happily, as is evident from his performances. The same holds of other serious, if lesser, threats, among them the threat that the country may be isolated, despised, declining \u2014 with dues to pay after it\u2019s no longer his concern. The Democrats are now torn between a popular base that is largely social democratic and a New Democrat leadership that panders to the donor class. Under Obama, the party was reduced to shambles at the local and state level, a particularly serious matter because the 2020 elections will determine redistricting, offering opportunities for gerrymandering even beyond today\u2019s scandalous situation. The bankruptcy of the Democrat elite is well-illustrated by the obsession with alleged Russian meddling with our sacred elections. Whatever it might amount to \u2014 apparently very little \u2014 it cannot begin to compare with the \u201cmeddling\u201d of campaign funding, which largely determines electoral outcomes, as extensive research has shown, particularly the careful work of Thomas Ferguson, which he and his colleagues have now extended to the 2016 elections. As Ferguson points out, when Republican elites realized that it was going to be Trump or Clinton, they responded with a huge wave of last-minute money that not only led to Clinton\u2019s late October decline but also had the same effect on Democratic candidates for Senate, \u201cvirtually in lock step.\u201d It is \u201coutlandish,\u201d Ferguson observes, that former FBI Director James Comey or the Russians \u201ccould be responsible for both collapses\u201d in the final stage of the campaign: \u201cFor the first time in the entire history of the United States, the partisan outcome of Senate races coincided perfectly with the results of every state\u2019s presidential balloting.\u201d The outcome conforms very well to Ferguson\u2019s well-supported \u201cInvestment theory of party competition.\u201d But facts and logic matter little. The Democrats are bent on revenge for their 2016 failure, having run such a rotten campaign that what looked like a \u201csure thing\u201d collapsed. Evidently, Trump\u2019s severe assault against the common good is a lesser matter, at least to the party elite. It\u2019s sometimes been noted that the US not only regularly meddles in foreign elections, including Russian ones, but also proceeds to subvert and sometimes overthrow governments it doesn\u2019t like. Horrifying consequences abound, to the present, from Central America to the Middle East. Guatemala has been a horror story since a US-backed coup overthrew its elected reformist government in 1954. Gaza, declining in misery, may become unlivable by 2020, the UN predicts, not by acts of God. In 2006, Palestinians committed a grave crime: They ran the first free election in the Arab world, and made the \u201cwrong\u201d choice, handing power to Hamas. Israel reacted by escalating violence and a brutal siege. The US reverted to standard operating procedure and prepared a military coup, pre-empted by Hamas. In punishment for this new crime, US-Israeli torture of Gaza sharply increased, not only with strangulation but also regular murderous and destructive US-backed Israeli invasions, on pretexts that quickly collapse on examination. Elections that come out the wrong way plainly cannot be tolerated under our policy of \u201cdemocracy promotion.\u201d In recent European elections, there has been much concern about possible Russian meddling. That was particularly true of the 2017 German elections, when the far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland(AfD) did surprisingly well, winning 94 seats in the Bundestag, the first time it had won seats. One can easily imagine the reaction had Russian meddling been detected behind these frightening results. It turns out that there was indeed foreign meddling, but not from Russia. AfD hired a Texas media firm (Harris Media) known for support of right-wing nationalist candidates (Trump, Le Pen, Netanyahu). The firm enlisted the cooperation of the Berlin office of Facebook, which provided it with detailed information about potential voters for use in microtargeting those who might be receptive to AfD\u2019s message. It may have worked. The story seems to have been ignored, apart from the business press. If the Democratic Party cannot overcome its deep internal problems and the slow expansion of the economy under Obama and Trump continues without disruption or disaster, the Republican wrecking ball may be swinging away at the foundations of a decent society, and at the prospects for survival, for a long time."

The Republican organization is also labouring to turn the US itself into a disaster area by removing controls on toxic chemicals and pursuing other destructive policies \u2013 all part of the unleashing of its most savage component to serve their constituency of extreme wealth and corporate power, whatever the impact on others. A truly shocking spectacle. How much damage they can do to the environment is not clear because other factors, even market forces, are countering their dedication to destruction. But it will not be slight. Effective actions require mobilization and serious commitment at every level, from international co-operation to individual choices."

Accept the principle of the \u2018double freeze\u2019 strongly advocated by China, with Russian support and indications of North Korean acquiescence: NK freezes its weapons programmes and the US calls off the threatening military operations at the NK border, including flights by nuclear-capable bombers; appalling actions in themselves given the history and, if anyone cares, a violation of the UN Charter\u2019s basic principle barring the \u2018threat\u2019 of force in international affairs. This could open the way to negotiations on further matters and the actual history, not the propaganda version, suggests that they might achieve considerable success.

    "output": "Interesting question. The latest poll I\u2019ve seen, by the best-known American polling agency (Gallup), found that the US was regarded as the gravest threat to world peace by an overwhelming margin in international opinion, far ahead of second-place Pakistan (presumably inflated by the Indian vote). Few are aware of this. A database search found no references in the US press. Such searches don\u2019t pick up everything. I was told (and can\u2019t verify) that the poll was reported in a Murdoch tabloid, theNew York Post, to illustrate how crazy the world is. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that would be the reaction among a substantial part of the public. Actually, there\u2019s no reason to expect much. Fifteen years ago the prominent intellectuals Samuel Huntington and Robert Jervis (then president of the American Political Science Association) pointed out that much of the world sees the US as a \u2018rogue superpower\u2019 and \u2018the single greatest external threat to their societies\u2019. I\u2019ve cited this a few times. Haven\u2019t noticed any other references, or concern \u2013 in the mainstream media, that is. This reminds me of a wonderful article by theNew York Timescultural critic Richard Bernstein 30 years ago, pondering the curious fact that the US is isolated at the UN. The title of the article is \u2018The UN versus the US\u2019, not \u2018the US versus the UN\u2019. The question, throughout, is why the world is out of step. British intellectuals, like John Stuart Mill, also wrote on how the world somehow doesn\u2019t seem to comprehend the august nature of British power and subjects the British to \u2018obloquy\u2019 when they sacrifice in the interests of all."

It also tends to ignore the lessons of economic history, including contemporary history, about how development really takes place. The US, for example, is commonly presented as a model of free market capitalist development (with some unfortunate deviations); whereas, in fact, the most crucial component of the development of the US (and British) economies was cotton production in hideous slave labour camps that would have impressed the Nazis, and the expulsion or extermination of the indigenous population by state violence \u2013 facts not considered within the domain of economics. This is quite apart from the fact that the US was one of the most avid protectionists and relied very heavily, as it still does, on the dynamic state sector of the economy. Lessons to the Third World that overlook the history of development (and de-development by force) can be extremely harmful; even more so when combined with support, based on abstract doctrine, for the so-called \u2018free trade agreements\u2019 that are primarily investor rights agreements that are highly protectionist, and in large measure not about trade at all. There are many economists who understand all of this and are not subject to these critical comments, which, nevertheless, do unfortunately hold for much of the profession and economics education."

It\u2019s not an agreement, at least if people are part of their country. It is a mixture of liberalization and protectionism designed for the interests of the designers (not surprisingly), including exorbitant patent protection for pharmaceutical and media corporations. Much of it is not about trade at all but about protecting investors. In fact much of the so-called \u2018trade\u2019 across the border is an ideological construct, which should not be regarded as trade at all. It consists of interactions within command economies, as when an automotive company produces parts in Indiana, sends them to Mexico for assembly and sells the product in Los Angeles. The current huge \u2018trade treaties\u2019 are largely secret \u2013 from the public, but not from the hordes of corporate lawyers and lobbyists writing the details. The few leaks indicate that they will be much like NAFTA. It\u2019s rather interesting that the administration also calls for \u2018Fast Track\u2019 \u2013 that is, Stalinist-style confirmation by Congress with little consultation, or input or even knowledge."

Could there be a clearer exhibition of pure farce?",
    "output": "Are the crimesdiscusseda basis for impeachment? Seems so to me. Has Trump committed vastly more serious crimes? That is hardly debatable. What might be debatable is whether he is indeed the most dangerouscriminal in human history (which happens to be my personal view). Hitler had been perhaps the leading candidate for this honor. His goal was to rid the German-run world of Jews, Roma, homosexuals and other\u201cdeviants,\u201dalong with tens of millions ofSlav\u201cUntermenschen.\u201dBut Hitler was not dedicated with fervor to destroying the prospects of organized human life onEarth in the not-distant future (alongwithmillions of other species). Trump is. And those who think he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing haven\u2019t been looking closely. Is that a wild and ludicrous exaggeration? Or the very simple and apparent truth?It\u2019s not difficult to figure out the answer. We\u2019ve discussed it often before. There is no need to review what is happening on Trump\u2019s watch while he devotes every effort to accelerating the race to catastrophe, trailed by such lesser lights asBrazil\u2019s JairBolsonaroandAustralia\u2019s Scott Morrison. Every day brings new forebodings. We have just learned, for example, that the giganticThwaites Glacierin West Antarctica has been eroding from warm water below. TheWashington Postdescribes thisas \u201ca troubling finding that could speed its melt in a region with the potential to eventually unleash more than10 feetof sea-level rise,\u201d adding, \u201cScientists already knew that Thwaites was losing massive amounts of ice\u2014more than600 billion tonsover the past several decades, and most recently as much as 50 billion tons per year.\u201dIt has now been confirmed, as suspected, that\u201cthis was occurring because a layer of relatively warmer ocean water, which circles Antarctica below the colder surface layer, had moved closer to shore and begun to eat away at the glaciers themselves, affecting West Antarctica in particular.\u201dThe chief scientist involved in the study warns that this may signal\u201can unstoppable retreat that has huge implications for globalsea-level rise.\u201d That\u2019s today. Tomorrow will be something worse. What\u2019s causing the warmer water? No secret. This is only one of the likely irreversible tipping points that may be reached if \u201cthe Chosen One,\u201d as he modestly describes himself, is granted another four years to carry out his project of global destruction. We have just witnessed an extraordinary event at the January Davos meeting of the Masters of the Universe, as they are called; for Adam Smith,they were only \u201cthe masters of mankind,\u201d but 250 years ago it was just British merchants and manufacturers. The conference opened with Trump\u2019soration about what a fabulous creature he is. The encomium was interrupted only by a comment that we should not be\u201calarmist\u201dabout the climate. His Magnificence was followed by the quiet and informed comments of a17-year old girlinstructing the heads of state, CEOs, media leaders and grand intellectuals about what it means to be a responsible adult. Quite a spectacle. Trump\u2019s war on organized life onEarth is only the barest beginning. More narrowly, in recent days,theChosenOne has issued executive orders ridding the country of the plague of regulations that protect children from mercury poisoning and preserve the country\u2019s water supplies and lands, along with other impediments to further enrichment of Trump\u2019s primary constituency, extreme wealth and corporate power. On the side, he has been casually proceeding to dismantle the last vestiges of the arms control regime that has provided some limited degree of security from terminal nuclear war, eliciting cheers from the military industry. And as we have just learned, the great pacifist who is committed to end interventions \u201cdropped more bombsand other munitions in Afghanistan last year than any other year since documentation began in 2006, Air Force data shows.\u201d He is also ramping up his acts of war\u2014which is what they are\u2014against Iran. I won\u2019t even go into his giving Israel what the Israeli press calls \u201ca gift to the right,\u201d formally giving the back of his imperial hand to international law, the World Court, the UN Security Council and overwhelming international opinion, while shoring up the Evangelical vote for the 2020 election. The prerogative of supreme power. In brief,the list of Trump\u2019scrimes is immense, not least the worst crime in human history. But none merit a nod in the impeachment proceedings. This is hardly a novelty; rather the norm. The current proceedings are often compared with Watergate. Nixon\u2019shideous crimes were eliminated from the charges against him despite the efforts ofRep.Robert Frederick Drinananda few others. The Nixon impeachment charges focused on his illegal acts to harm Democrats."

First, can you summarize for us what you perceive to be the core of Sanders\u2019spolitico-ideological gestalt, and then explain what scares both conservatives and liberals\u2014the possibility of someone like Sanders leading the country?",
    "output": "The core of Sanders\u2019s\u201cpolitico-ideological gestalt\u201dis his long-standing commitment to the interests of the large majority of the population, not the top 0.1percent(not 1percent, 0.1percent) who hold more than20percentof the country\u2019s wealth, not the very rich who were the prime beneficiaries of the slow recovery from the 2008 disaster caused by financial capital. The U.S.achievement in this regard far surpasses that of other developed countries, so we learn from recently released studies, whichshowthat in the U.S.,65percentof the growth of the past decade went to the very rich; next in line was Germany, at 51percent, then declining sharply. The same studies show that if current trends persist, in the next decadeall growth in the U.S.will go to the rich. The welfare of these sectors has never been Sanders\u2019s concern. The Democratic establishment and liberal media are hardly likely to look kindly on someone who forthrightly proclaims,\u201cI have no use for those\u2014regardless of their political party\u2014who hold some foolish dream of spinning the clock back to days when unorganized labor was a huddled, almost helpless mass....Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.\u201dBy\u201cright to work\u201d laws, for example, or by hiring scabs, or by threatening to ship jobs to Mexico to undermine organizing efforts, to sample the bipartisan political leadership. That\u2019s surely the kind of socialist wild man whom the country is not ready to tolerate. The wild man in this case is President Dwight Eisenhower, the last conservative president. His remarks are a good illustration of how far the political class has shifted to the right under Clintonite \u201cNew Democrats\u201d and the Reagan-Gingrich Republicans. The latter havedrifted so far off the political spectrumthat they are ranked near neo-fascist parties in the international spectrum, well to the right of \u201cconservatives.\u201d Even more threatening than Sanders\u2019s proposals to carry forward New Deal-style policies, I think,is his inspiring a popular movement that is steadily engaged in political action and direct activism to change the social order\u2014 a movement of people, mostly young, who have not internalized the norms of liberal democracy: that the public are \u201cignorant and meddlesome outsiders\u201d who are to be \u201cspectators, not participants in action,\u201d entitled to pusha lever every four years but are then to return to their TV sets and video games while the \u201cresponsible men\u201d look after serious matters. This is a fundamental principle of democracy as expounded by prominent and influential liberal 20th\u2013century American intellectuals, who took cognizance of \u201cthe stupidity of the average man\u201d and recognized that we should not be deluded by \u201cdemocratic dogmatisms about men being the best judges of their own interests.\u201d They are not; we are \u2014 the \u201cresponsible men,\u201d the \u201cintelligent minority.\u201d The \u201cbewildered herd\u201d must therefore be \u201cput in their place\u201d by \u201cnecessary illusions\u201d and \u201cemotionally potent simplifications.\u201d These are among the pronouncements of the most influential 20th\u2013century public intellectual, Walter Lippmann, in his \u201cprogressive essays on democracy\u201d; HaroldLasswell, one of the founders of modern political science; and Reinhold Niebuhr, the admired \u201ctheologian of the (liberal) establishment.\u201d All highly respected Wilson-FDR-Kennedy liberals. Inspiring a popular movement that violates these norms is a serious attack on democracy, so conceived, an intolerable assault against good order."

And,if so, what does this tell us about liberal democracy, which is nowadays in serious trouble itself onaccount of the rise and spread of authoritarianism and the far right in many parts of the world?",
    "output": "There are definite similarities. Corbyn, a decent and honorable man, was subjected to an extraordinary flood of vilification and defamation, which he was unable to confront. At the same time, polls indicated that the policies that he put forth\u2014and that had led to a remarkable victory forLabourin 2017\u2014remained popular. A special feature in the U.K.was Brexit, a matter I won\u2019t go into here (my personal opinion, for what it\u2019s worth, is that it is a serious blow to both Britain and the EU, and is likely to cause Britain \u2014 or what remains of it \u2014 to become even more of a vassal of the U.S.than it has been under Blair\u2019s NewLabourand the Tories, whose social and economic policies have caused the country great harm). Corbyn\u2019s vacillation on the Brexit issue, which became a toxic one, surely contributed to the negative feelings about him that seem to have been a major factor in the electoral disaster forLabour, but it was only one. As in the case of Sanders, I suspect that the prime reason for the bitter hatred of Corbyn on the part of a very wide spectrum of the British establishment is his effort to turn theLabourParty into a participatory organization that would not leave electoral politics in the hands of theLabourbureaucracy and would proceed beyond the narrow realm of electoral politics to far broader and constant activism and engagement in public affairs. More generally, much of the world is aflame. As the men of Davos recognized with trepidation at their January meeting, the peasants are coming with their pitchforks:The neoliberal order they have imposed for the past 40 years, while ultra-generous to them and their class, has had a bitter impact on the general population. A leading theme at Davos was that the Masters must declare that they are changing their stance from service to the rich to attending to the concerns of \u201cstakeholders\u201d \u2014 working people and communities. Another theme was that while not \u201calarmists,\u201d they acknowledge the threat of global warming. The unstated implication is that there is no need for regulations and other actions about climate change:We Big Boys will take care of it. GretaThunbergand the other children demonstrating out there can go back to school. And now that we see the flaws in our neoliberal model of capitalism, you can put aside all those disruptive political programs calling for healthcare, rights of workers, women, the poor. We\u2019re taking care of it, so just go back to your private pursuits, keeping to democratic norms. As the neoliberal order is visibly collapsing, it is giving rise to \u201cmorbid symptoms\u201d (to borrow Gramsci\u2019s famous phrase when the fascist plague was looming). Among these are the spread of authoritarianism and the far right that you mention. More generally, what we are witnessing is quite understandable anger, resentment and contempt for the political institutions that have implemented the neoliberal assault \u2014 but also the rise of activist movements that seek to overcome the ills of global society and to stem and reverse the race to destruction. The confrontation could hardly have been exhibited more dramatically than by the appearance of Greta Thunberg immediately after the most powerful man in the world\u2014the leader in the race to destruction\u2014had admonished the Masters to disdain the \u201cheirs of yesterday\u2019s foolish fortune tellers\u201d(virtually 100percentof climate scientists)and to take up his wrecking ball."

Their first day in office, they start making phone calls to the potential donors for their next election. Meanwhile, hordes of corporate lobbyists descend on their offices. Their staff are often young kids, totally overwhelmed by the resources, the wealth, the power, of the massive lobbyists who pour in. Out of that comes legislation, which the representative later signs \u2014 maybe even looks at occasionally, when he can get off the phone with the donors.

This extends earlier work by Martin Gilens, Benjamin Page, and others who found pretty similar results, and the general picture is clear: the working class and most of the middle class are basically unrepresented.

There are many, many devices by which you can ensure that a large majority of the population is unrepresented, and, furthermore, robbed \u2014 robbedmassively. The RAND Corporation, ultrarespectable, a couple of months ago did a study of what they call the \u201ctransfer of wealth\u201d from the working class and the middle class \u2014 or, more accurately, the robbery of the public \u2014 since the neoliberal assault began around 1980. Their estimate for how much wealth has moved from the lower 90 percent of the income scale to the very top is $47 trillion. It\u2019s not small change, and it\u2019s a vast underestimate. When Reagan opened the spigots for corporate robbery many devices became available: for example, tax havens and shell companies, which were illegal before that, when the Treasury Department enforced the law. How much money was stolen that way? That\u2019s mostly secret, but there are some reasonable estimates. An IMF study came out recently that estimated $35 trillion, roughly \u2014 just from tax havens \u2014 over forty years. Keep adding this theft up. It\u2019s not pennies, and it affects people\u2019s lives. People are angry, and they\u2019re resentful for very good reasons: they\u2019re perfectly arranged for a demagogue to come along \u2014 Trump-style \u2014 who holds up a banner with one hand saying, \u201cI love you, I\u2019m going to save you,\u201d and with the other hand stabs you in the back to pay off the rich and powerful."

    "output": "The first thing we should remember is that the Sanders campaign was a remarkable success. Within a couple of years, Sanders and others working alongside him have managed to shift the range of issues that are at the center of attention very far toward the progressive side. That\u2019s quite significant. They did so with no funding, no corporate support, no media support \u2014 the media became mildly friendly to Sanders after he lost the nomination, not before. Before, it was kind of like what happened to [Jeremy] Corbyn in the UK: powerful forces were determined to stop anything to the left of the most mild social democracy. Looking back at the success of the Sanders campaign, I think one answer to your question is \u201ckeep at it.\u201d Remember, a terrible mistake was made when Obama was elected: namely, a lot of the Left believed in him. Obama had a tremendous amount of popular support, especially from young people \u2014 lots of young activists and organizers worked to get him elected. After the election, what happened? He told them, \u201cGo home.\u201d And unfortunately, they went home. Within two years, Obama had completely betrayed his constituency, and it showed in the 2010 election. It\u2019s not that the right wing won the labor vote; the Democrats lost it \u2014 for good reasons. In 2010, even union voters didn\u2019t support the Democratic candidate; they saw what Obama had done. Well, we shouldn\u2019t make that mistake again, certainly not with Biden. Biden is kind of a weak read, in my opinion; he can be pressed. There are some quite good people in the Biden administration, especially among the economic advisors, and they can be pressed. Take climate change. There isn\u2019t any more important issue. If we don\u2019t deal with the environmental catastrophe soon, everything else is moot; there won\u2019t be anything to talk about. A lot of pressure on the Biden-Harris campaign from the Sunrise Movement and others did manage to press their program toward the progressive side. Not far enough \u2014 but, still, their program is the best that\u2019s ever been produced. But the DNC started hacking away at it. Through August, when you Googled the Democratic Party climate program, you got the Biden-Harris program. The last time I saw it was August 22. The next time I looked, a couple of days later, it wasn\u2019t there. What you got instead was \u201chow to donate to the DNC.\u201d I can only speculate as to what happened, but I think there\u2019s a struggle going on. And it could continue if the Left doesn\u2019t make the Obama mistake, and believes those who are in power and their pretty words. The same is true of the corporate sector, which is running scared. They\u2019re concerned with what they call \u201creputational risks,\u201d meaning \u201cthe peasants are coming with their pitchforks.\u201d All across the corporate world \u2014 at Davos, and at the Business Roundtable \u2014 there are discussions of how \u201cWe have to confess to the public that we\u2019ve done the wrong things. We haven\u2019t paid enough attention to stakeholders, workforce, and community, but now we realize our errors. Now we\u2019re becoming what, in the 1950s, were called \u2018soulful corporations,\u2019 really dedicated to the common good.\u201d So, now we have lots of \u201csoulful corporations,\u201d appealing to the public with their great humanity, sometimes taking measures like withdrawing funding from fossil fuel companies; they can be pressed. I don\u2019t like the system, you don\u2019t like the system, but it exists, and we have to work within it. We can\u2019t say, \u201cI don\u2019t want it. Let\u2019s have another system that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d We can only build a new system through pressure from inside and from outside. So, for example, there\u2019s no reason to avoid working to create an alternative political and social framework by creating a new party or worker-owned enterprises and cooperatives. The point is that there is a whole array of options open to us \u2014 and they all have to be pursued. AK: I agree that Bernie Sanders was certainly incredibly successful in waking people up so that many more people thought about politics in class terms. He also did spark quite a bit of anger, because realizing just how much the system is rigged against the average American infuriates people. I think people are getting incredibly impatient with our lack of influence on our lawmakers. Well, the lack of influence goes back in the United States roughly two hundred fifty years. So, we can start with the Constitution, which was established explicitly on the principle of preventing democracy. There wasn\u2019t any secret about it. In fact, the major scholarly study on the Constitutional Convention, by Michael Klarman, a Harvard Law professor, is calledThe Framers\u2019 Coup, and it\u2019s about the coup against democracy by the Framers. The theme of the of the founders was expressed quite well by John Jay, who was the first Supreme Court chief justice: \u201cthose who own the country ought to govern it.\u201d That\u2019s what we see today: those who own the country have succeeded in governing it. This hasn\u2019t been a uniform procedure; there has been plenty of resistance, and lots of victories have been won. During my childhood, for example, in the 1930s, there were major victories, mainly spearheaded by the organized labor movement (CIO organizing, militant strikes, militant labor actions), a moderately sympathetic administration, and political activism of all sorts. The United States moved toward moderate social democracy \u2014 we\u2019re still enjoying some of the benefits of that, though a lot of it\u2019s been chipped away. Other periods of American history were similar. In the late nineteenth century, the Knights of Labor \u2014 a populist movement that has nothing to do with what\u2019s called \u201cpopulism\u201d today \u2014 and radical farmers were getting together a major movement, which was finally crushed by state and corporate force, but left a residue. This is fundamentally a class struggle that goes on through history, and now we\u2019re in a particular stage of it. We keep struggling, we make improvements, there\u2019s some regression, and we keep going. Slavery was overcome after hundreds of years of struggle, and then it came back in another form \u2014 the residue is still there. But it\u2019s not that there\u2019s no victory at all. Things are better than they were because of constant struggle. In fact, this country is a lot better than it was sixty years ago, mainly because of activism in the sixties. Just remember what the country was like in the 1960s. Federal funded housing was denied by law to African Americans, not because the liberal senators wanted that, but because you couldn\u2019t get anything through the Southern Democratic stranglehold on policy. There were anti-sodomy laws into this century. Lots of things have changed. It\u2019s not easy, but if you say, \u201cWell, we haven\u2019t gotten where we wanted; I\u2019m going to quit,\u201d you just guarantee that the worst is going to happen. It\u2019s a constant struggle. Take, say, Tony Mazzocchi \u2014 one of the heroes of modern labor, head of the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers [International] Union, one of the first serious environmentalists in the country. His constituents at the front line were being murdered by pollution, destruction of the environment, and so on. This is in the early seventies, way before the environmental movement took off. His union was working toward dealing with the environmental crisis, and it moved on to try to establish a labor party in the nineties. It could have worked, but it didn\u2019t make it. The neoliberal assault \u2014 beginning with Reagan, on through Clinton, Obama \u2014 was designed to destroy labor. Reagan\u2019s campaign opened with an attack on the labor unions. Thatcher did exactly the same thing in England. The people behind the neoliberal assault understood what they were doing: you have to eliminate the ability of laboring people to defend themselves. Clinton extended this; his neoliberal globalization policies were designed to protect investors and to crush labor, and they succeeded. It was similar to the thirties. In the 1920s, labor had been virtually crushed. There was a successful militant labor movement in the early part of the twentieth century, but after Woodrow Wilson\u2019s red scare, it was almost destroyed. In the 1920s, there was almost nothing there, but it came roaring back in the thirties \u2014 that\u2019s what led to the New Deal policies, the mild social democracy that we still benefit from. We can rebuild again. In fact, it\u2019s beginning to happen in quite interesting ways. So, labor had been so crushed by neoliberal policies that there were barely any strikes. Workers were afraid to go on strike; they\u2019d be destroyed. Strikes started to pick up in red states among nonunionized labor. Teachers in West Virginia and Arizona had enormous public support. In Northern Arizona, when the teachers began the strike, there were posters all over lawns saying, \u201cSupport the Teachers!\u201d And the teachers weren\u2019t just calling for higher salaries \u2014 which they very much deserve \u2014 but for improving the educational system, which has been hit by the neoliberal plague. Privatization, defunding, regimentation, teaching to the test \u2014 all of these things were bipartisan. Republicans are more extreme, so Betsy DeVos was almost openly devoted to destroying the whole system. But Obama\u2019s policies weren\u2019t much better. Here\u2019s the teachers\u2019 strike, with lots of popular support. There have also been nurses\u2019 strikes, service union strikes, a big GM strike, and more of that could happen. The destruction of labor has been a major factor in creating extreme inequality. There are some mainstream economists like Lawrence Summers who have concluded that it\u2019sthemajor factor in extreme inequality \u2014 just taking away the ability of workers to defend themselves. Certainly, it\u2019s a major factor that could allow alternative political parties like Mazzocchi\u2019s to come back. Pressure on the Democrats to move to the Left \u2014 like the kind of thing that [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Squad and others are doing \u2014 can have an effect, but it\u2019s got to have a lot of popular action behind it. If the troops go home, the party\u2019s going to move to the Right. There\u2019s one force that\u2019s relentless: the business classes are Marxists, and they\u2019re fighting a vicious class war all the time. They never stop. If the rest of the population leaves the struggle, you know what\u2019s going to happen. In fact, we\u2019ve seen forty years of it. NV: I want to ask about that class struggle, because [Thomas] Piketty, for example, has pointed out that across the Western democracies the class composition of parties has been shifting in pretty striking ways."

    "output": "Well, let\u2019s start with the United States. So, by the late 1970s \u2014 the late [Jimmy] Carter years \u2014 the Democrats basically told the working class, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any interest in you.\u201d The last gasp of pro-labor activity in the Democratic Party was the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act in 1978. Carter didn\u2019t veto it, but he watered it down so it was toothless. From that point on, the Democrats essentially abandoned the working class, aside from a few gestures here and there. When Clinton came, NAFTA was rammed through in secret over the objections of the labor movement. They weren\u2019t even informed until the last minute of what the framework was: investor rights agreements. The Labor Advisory Committee did come out with an alternative program for NAFTA, saying \u201cHere\u2019s a much better way to do it. The executive version is going to lead to a low-growth, low-wage economy. Here\u2019s a way to do it with a high-growth, high-wage economy.\u201d It happened that their program was almost the same as that of the Congress\u2019s own research agency, the Office of Technology Assessment. Nobody paid attention to them; the executive branch didn\u2019t care. They wantedtheirversion of NAFTA, which was basically an investor rights agreement that sets working people in competition with each other without rights. It turned out that under Clinton\u2019s NAFTA, corporations were able to break organizing efforts at a very high level \u2014 about 50 percent of them were broken simply by threats to move the enterprise to Mexico. The threats weren\u2019t serious, but they were enough to break the organizing effort. This happens to be illegal, but when you have a criminal state, you can carry out illegal acts. There\u2019s a good study of this by Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor economist at Cornell, who found what I just described \u2014 that about 50 percent of organizing efforts were broken illegally, just by threats to move the enterprise. That\u2019s only one example. In 2008, labor voted for Obama; in 2010, it was gone \u2014 labor had seen what his promises meant, all right. This was the midst of a huge financial crisis caused by the collapse of the housing market. Congress under [George W.] Bush, in fact, had passed TARP [Troubled Asset Relief Program] legislation to do something about it. The legislation has two components. One was to bail out the perpetrators of the crisis: the banks who had caused the crisis with predatory lending practices and other devious semi-criminal actions. The other part of the legislation was to bail out the victims: people that lost their homes under foreclosures, lost their jobs. Anybody who knows American history and politics could have predicted which half of the legislation was going to be implemented by President Obama. Within two years, the working class \u2014 even the unionized working class \u2014 had said, \u201cThis party isn\u2019t working for us. They\u2019re our enemy.\u201d Where can you go? You can go to the guys who claim that they\u2019re going to bring back traditional America and get you jobs. They\u2019re not going to do it, of course, but they at least claim to. You take a look at Trump voters; they have been carefully studied. A lot of them say, \u201cYeah, we know he\u2019s a jerk, he\u2019s not going to do anything. But at least he says that he likes us.\u201d He stands up and says, \u201cI\u2019m with you. I want you to do good. I act like you.\u201d Like George W. Bush \u2014 you may recall that every weekend, he would go off to Texas and his farm, and be filmed cutting brush in hundred degree temperatures to show that he\u2019s a real ordinary guy. After he left office, I don\u2019t think he ever went back there. The most careful studies I\u2019ve seen of Trump voters are those of Anthony DiMaggio, a left social scientist. He did a recent analysis on what\u2019s known so far about the 2020 Trump voters, and it looks like, once again, apart from the evangelicals and the white supremacists, the main voting base for Trump is basically petty bourgeois with incomes from $100,000 to $200,000. That\u2019s not working people \u2014 that\u2019s small businessmen, insurance salesmen, and so on. That seems to be the main base, and it seems to be the only part that increased substantially since 2016. lot of working people think, \u201cWell, at least Trump says something nice to us. Democrats don\u2019t do anything.\u201d Take, say, South Texas: there\u2019s been a lot of study of why South Texas, which hadn\u2019t voted for a Republican for a hundred years \u2014 since [Warren] Harding \u2014 moved toward Trump. These are Mexican-American communities. How come they broke with a hundred years of voting Democrat? First of all, the Democrats didn\u2019t make the slightest effort to do any organizing: \u201cThey\u2019re Hispanic. They vote for us.\u201d People don\u2019t like that, you know. But there was a scarier reason. These are oil-producing areas. All that they heard was \u201cBiden wants to take away our jobs because a bunch of pointy-headed rich liberals claim there\u2019s a climate crisis.\u201d If the Democrats cared at all about working people, they would have been down there saying, \u201cLook, there\u2019s a climate crisis, and we are going to have to transition away from fossil fuels, period. But you can have better jobs, better lives, a better economy, by moving toward working on changing the industries \u2014 maybe under your own control \u2014 to sustainable energy and constructive development.\u201d That\u2019s what organizers do, okay. The Democrats didn\u2019t bother; the working class is not their constituency. So, South Texans voted for the guy who says, \u201cI\u2019m gonna bring your jobs back.\u201d AK: There\u2019s this ongoing debate about whether or not the Republican Party can legitimately and sincerely become the party of the working class in the future. Obviously, we\u2019re skeptical, but there has been a rhetorical shift. First of all, workers have to have something to vote for. If the Democrats say, \u201cWe don\u2019t care about you. We\u2019re the party of Wall Street and rich professionals. We have Hollywood stars at our events, and who cares about you,\u201d they\u2019ll vote for the guy who says, \u201cI like you. I act like you. I hate the elite.\u201d They\u2019ll vote for that guy even if he\u2019s not doing anything for them, and, in fact, screwing them. If you want to look at these Republicans who claim to be pro\u2013working class, look at how they vote. Look at how they voted on the one legislative achievement of the Trump administration: the tax scam, which gave a huge amount of money to the very rich and is stabbing the working class in the back. How did they vote on the way the CARES program was administrated \u2014 so that funding goes to banks, who then decide how to distribute it, and they give it to their rich clients? Take a look at the actual legislative actions. It\u2019s very easy to get up and say, \u201cI\u2019m for the workers,\u201d you know? Maybe people will say, \u201cWell, at least he says he likes us.\u201d People are voting just out of frustration if they vote at all. Remember, almost half the population didn\u2019t even bother. So, unless there\u2019s a constructive alternative, people aren\u2019t going to join a movement. Yet during the Sanders campaign, most liberal commentators said, \u201cHis proposals are very good. But they\u2019re too radical for the American people.\u201d"

Do you know of any other country that doesn\u2019t have universal medical care?

Well, the Left \u2014 the authentic left \u2014 ought to be able to break through that and say that Sanders has programs that wouldn\u2019t have much surprised [Dwight] Eisenhower. Eisenhower was strongly pro\u2013New Deal. His position was that anyone who questions the New Deal doesn\u2019t belong in the American political system. During the neoliberal years, things have moved so far to the Right at the elite level \u2014 at the power level \u2014 that it\u2019s hard to remember what was normal not long before. The Left can reach people by reviving the labor movement, moving toward the labor party, pressing the liberal part of the Democratic Party toward moderately social democratic ends \u2014 particularly on things like the climate. I should also mention the issue of nuclear weapons. It\u2019s not talked about. It\u2019s a major threat to our existence. The threat is increasing enormously. One of Trump\u2019s many crimes was to dismantle the whole arms-control system, and initiate moves toward creating very dangerous new weapons systems \u2014 those moves have to be terminated quickly, or we\u2019re in serious trouble.

Do you think it\u2019s still useful to think about socialism as a sort of political horizon?",
    "output": "It\u2019s useful, but there are some facts we have to remember. One of them is timescale. We have a decade or two to deal decisively with the environmental crisis. We\u2019re not going to overthrow capitalism in a couple of decades. You can continue working for socialism \u2014 but you have to recognize that the solution to the climate crisis is going to have to come within some kind of regimented capitalist system, not the neoliberal system. There are a variety of kinds of capitalism. So, you go back to the pre-neoliberal period \u2014 this period of so-called regimented capitalism \u2014 and within that framework of serious government control of the destructive excesses of unleashed capitalism, you have a chance to proceed. Meanwhile, we should be doing exactly what you said, trying to undermine capitalism. Take the fundamental evil of capitalism, which was always understood by traditional socialists \u2014 namely, the fact that you have to have a job. We consider having a job a wonderful thing. Working people in the early Industrial Revolution regarded it as an obscenity, a fundamental attack on essential human rights and dignity. Now, that was such a strong position that it was a slogan of the Republican Party under Lincoln: that wage labor differs from slavery only in that it\u2019s temporary, until you can become a free person. Well, freedom can be implemented by worker control of the enterprises of which they are a part. You can get it in one step, as in worker-owned enterprises, which are proliferating \u2014 but you can get it by a series of steps, like [Elizabeth] Warren and Sanders\u2019s proposals for worker representation on corporate managing boards. Worker representation is not very radical. Germany has it \u2014 a conservative country \u2014 but it is a step forward. You can move forward beyond that with actual direct action on the ground \u2014 for example, creating worker-owned enterprises \u2014 to changing the way in which the capitalist system works. If you have a carbon tax, don\u2019t do it like they did it in France, which led to the yellow vest movement. A carbon tax which is designed to hit the working class will lead to an uprising. You can have a carbon tax in which the revenue is returned to the public in a progressive manner \u2014 then it benefits the working class. Yes, you pay a little more for gas, but you get more in return. Same with health care. You save a huge amount of money if we go to a universal health care system, but you\u2019re going to pay higher taxes. Those are the tests for the Left: educational, organizational, activist. I think this is a tremendous range of opportunities available. But it\u2019s not enough to know what to do \u2014 you have to do it."

We don\u2019t want to have authentic, popular based political parties around, they could be out of control.\u201d Although there is no doubt, the Labour Party has had serious problems with antisemitism. Last year, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) identified \u201cserious failings in leadership and an inadequate process for handling antisemitism complaints across the Labour Party.\u201d The 130-page report went on to conclude that \u201cthere were unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination for which the Labour Party is responsible.\u201d The former Labour leader was embroiled in an antisemitism row of his own for appearing to support a graffiti artist whose antisemitic mural was removed from a wall \u2013 something he later apologised for. I bring up the genuine concerns raised regarding the Labour Party\u2019s and antisemitism, which some felt were dismissed by Corbyn. \u201cIf you look at the facts, the Tory party has more antisemitism than the Labour Party. There\u2019s something there, you know, you should deal with it. But it\u2019s not even within shouting distance of the way the issue was presented. By now, there\u2019s pretty careful analyses of it. And I think if you look at them, you find what we know in advance. Yes, there\u2019s antisemitism in England. That\u2019s a bad thing. We should deal with it. But it\u2019s not in the Labour Party any more than anywhere else, probably less. \u201cBut compared with, say, islamophobia, it doesn\u2019t even come close. Okay, that\u2019s acceptable. You\u2019re allowed that. In fact, if you look at the famous international Holocaust Remembrance Association\u2019s statement on antisemitism, which everybody\u2019s supposed to accept, just take its provisions and think about them for a minute. It follows that almost everybody\u2019s a hysterical islamophobe. The charges of what they call indications of antisemitism if you apply that to attitudes towards Islam and Muslims, it cuts a very wide swath.\u201d The current IHRA statement on antisemitism from its website reads: \u2018Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\u2019 Chomsky, who has previously spoken of being subjected to antisemitism as a child, finishes with \u201cantisemitism shouldn\u2019t be vulgarised and politicised, turned into a weapon. It\u2019s too serious for that.\u201d \u201cAntisemitism shouldn\u2019t be turned into a weapon\u201d Keir Starmer, the current Labour leader, declared that tackling antisemitism was his first priority as Labour leader. He followed through with his word when he sacked Rebecca Long-Bailey in summer 2020 for sharing an article that contained antisemitic conspiracy theories. Corbyn was later suspended himself for sharing a statement 30 minutes after the EHRC report claiming the scale of the antisemitism problem had been \u201coverstated for political reasons\u201d. Starmer has since faced criticism from large swathes of dedicated Corbyn supporters, many of which feel the party is moving to more centre-ground and not acting as serious opposition to the current government. Those more sympathetic to the challenges he\u2019s faced early in his premiership \u2013 namely a global pandemic \u2013 believe he\u2019s adopting a similar strategy to Joe Biden by waiting until his opponent fails. Wary that our time has run over by 36 minutes already, I ask if Starmer\u2019s strategy is a good one. \u201cIt\u2019s a good strategy if you want to turn the Labour Party into a junior partner of the Tories. Pretty much like what Tony Blair did, it used to be called Thatcher light. If that\u2019s what you want, fine. If you want a Labour Party that actually represents the working people of England, middle-class people of England, pursue their interests, it\u2019s not the way to do it. It depends on what your goals are. It looks to me that Starmer\u2019s is pretty much dismantling the activist Labour Party that the Corbyn people were trying to develop.\u201d It\u2019s a statement that will thrill Corbynistas but probably won\u2019t surprise Starmtroopers either. After all, Chomsky himself said he\u2019d back Corbyn during the 2017 election campaign, and he\u2019s hardly someone that\u2019s tempted by moderate politics, although he did endorse Joe Biden. Though he\u2019s happy about the path he\u2019s going down regarding the climate crisis, he\u2019s not convinced it\u2019s entirely original. \u201cBiden\u2019s programme is much better than any predecessor, not because of a religious conversion, because of very significant activist pressures, which have made a difference.\u201d After just over one hour 20 minutes, the interview draws to a close. He politely explains he has got to go, more appointments. I steal a second to ask one final question. Where does he see the world in 2050? His answer is unapologetically Chomsky-esque. \u201cWell, there\u2019s one thing we can say, either we will have reached net-zero emissions by 2050, or we can pretty much say goodbye to each other.\u201d"

If it\u2019s possible to break out of the propaganda bubble for a few minutes, the US has a long record of undermining and destroying democracy. Do I have to run through it? Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Chile in 1973, on and on... But we are supposed to now honour and admire Washington\u2019s enormous commitment to sovereignty and democracy. What happened in history doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s for other people. \u201cWhat about Nato expansion? There was an explicit, unambiguous promise by [US secretary of state] James Baker and president George HW Bush to Gorbachev that if he agreed to allow a unifiedGermanyto rejoin Nato, the US would ensure that there would be no move one inch to the east. There\u2019s a good deal of lying going on about this now.\u201d Chomsky, who observed in 1990 that \u201cif the Nuremberg laws were applied, then every postwar American president would have been hanged\u201d, spoke witheringly ofJoe Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly right to have moral outrage about Putin\u2019s actions in Ukraine,\u201d he said of Biden\u2019s recent declaration that the Russian president \u201ccannot remain in power\u201d. \u201cBut it would be even more progress to have moral outrage about other horrible atrocities... In Afghanistan, literally millions of people are facing imminent starvation. Why? There\u2019s food in the markets. But people who have little money have to watch their children starve because they can\u2019t go to the market to buy food. Why? Because the United States, with the backing of Britain, has kept Afghanistan\u2019s funds in New York banks and will not release them.\u201d Chomsky\u2019s contempt for the hypocrisies and contradictions of US foreign policy will be familiar to anyone who has read one of his many books and pamphlets (his first political work,American Power and the New Mandarins, published in 1969, foretold the US\u2019s defeat in Vietnam). But he is now perhaps most animated when discussingDonald Trump\u2019spossible return and theclimate crisis. \u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember the early 1930s. And memories come to mind,\u201d he said in a haunting recollection. \u201cI can remember listening to Hitler\u2019s speeches on the radio. I didn\u2019t understand the words, I was six years old. But I understood the mood. And it was frightening and terrifying. And when you watch one of Trump\u2019s rallies that can\u2019t fail to come to mind. That\u2019s what we\u2019re facing.\u201d Though he self-identifies as an anarcho-syndicalist or a libertarian socialist, Chomsky revealed to me that he had voted for Republicans in the past (\u201clike them or not, they were an authentic party\u201d). But now he said, they were a truly dangerous insurgency. \u201cBecause of Trump\u2019s fanaticism, the worshipful base of the Republican Party barely regards climate change as a serious problem. That\u2019s a death warrant to the species.\u201d Faced with such existential threats, it is perhaps unsurprising that Chomsky remains a dissident intellectual \u2013 in the manner of one of his heroes,Bertrand Russell(who lived to 97 and similarly straddled politics and philosophy). But he also still spends hours a day answering emails from admirers and critics, and teaches linguistics at the University of Arizona, the state where he lives with his second wife, Valeria Wasserman, a Brazilian translator. is also still engaged by British politics. \u201cBrexitwas a very serious error, it means that Britain will be compelled to drift even further into subordination to the US,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think it\u2019s a disaster. What does it mean for the Conservative Party? I imagine they can lie their way out of it, they\u2019re doing a good job of lying about a lot of things and getting away with it.\u201d OfKeir Starmer, he scornfully remarked: \u201cHe\u2019s returning theLabour Partyto a party that\u2019s reliably obedient to power, that will be Thatcher-lite in the style ofTony Blairand that won\u2019t ruffle the feathers of either the US or anyone who\u2019s important in Britain.\u201d"

The Democratic establishment is now more or less what would have been called \u201cmoderate Republicans\u201d some years ago. The Republicans have gone off the spectrum. Comparative studies show that they rank alongside of fringe rightwing parties in Europe in their general positions. They are, furthermore, the only major conservative party to reject anthropogenic climate change, as already mentioned: a global anomaly. Two respected political analysts of the American Enterprise Institute, Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein, describe the Republican Party since Newt Gingrich\u2019s takeover in the \u201890s as not a normal political party but a \u201cradical insurgency\u201d that has largely abandoned parliamentary politics. Under McConnell\u2019s leadership, that has only become more evident \u2014 but he has ample company in Republican Party circles. The positions of the leadership on climate surely influence the attitudes of Republican Party loyalists. Only about 25 percent of Republicans (36 percent of the more savvy millennials) recognize that humans are responsible for global warming. Shocking figures. And in the ranking of urgent issues among Republicans, global warming (if it is even assumed to be taking place), is almost undetectable."

First, is the Green New Deal a detailed policy proposal to move us away from a climate change catastrophe, and, second, is it realistic?",
    "output": "Robert Pollin:The Green New Deal has gained tremendous traction as an organizing framework over the past year. This alone is a major achievement. But it is still imperative that we transform this big idea into a viable program. In my view, putting meat on the bones of the Green New Deal starts with a single simple idea: We have to absolutely stop burning oil, coal and natural gas to produce energy within the next 30 years at most; and we have to do this in a way that also supports rising living standards and expanding opportunities for working people and the poor throughout the world. This version of a Green New Deal program is, in fact, entirely realistic in terms of its purely economic and technical features. Clean renewable energy sources \u2014 including solar, wind, geothermal and to a lesser extent small-scale hydro and low emissions bioenergy \u2014 are already either at cost parity with fossil fuels and nuclear or they are cheaper. In addition, the single easiest and cheapest way to lower emissions is to raise energy efficiency standards, through, among other measures, retrofitting existing buildings; making new buildings operate as net zero energy consumers; and replacing gas-guzzler cars with expanding public transportation and electric cars. Energy efficiency measures, by definition, will save people money \u2014 for example, your home electricity bills could realistically be cut in half without having to reduce the amount that you light, heat or cool your house. So, the Green New Deal will not cost consumers anything over time, as long as we solve the actually quite simple problem of funding Green New Deal investments through the cost savings we gain by raising efficiency standards and producing cheap renewable energy. My coworkers and I have estimated that building a 100 percent clean energy system will require about 2.5 percent of global GDP per year for roughly the next 30 years. Yes, that\u2019s a lot of money in dollar terms, like about $2 trillion in 2021 and rising thereafter. But it does still mean that 97.5 percent of global economic activity can be devoted to things other than investments in clean energy."

The critical factor is that clean energy investments will create a lot more jobs than maintaining the existing dirty energy infrastructure \u2014 in the range of two to four times more jobs per dollar of spending in all countries that we have studied, including Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Spain and the United States. Of course, jobs that are tied to the fossil fuel industry will be eliminated. The affected workers and their communities must be supported through generous Just Transition measures, including guaranteeing workers\u2019 pensions, moving people into new jobs without losing incomes, and investing in impacted communities, in a range of projects. Land reclamation is just one such investment opportunity, including cleaning up abandoned coal mines and converting the residual coal ash into useful products, like paper.

    "output": "The simple answer is: work harder. There are no new special tricks. We know what the message is. We know the barriers that have to be overcome. We have to find ways to shape the message, in words and actions, so as to overcome the barriers. The message is two-fold: First, we\u2019re facing an existential crisis that must be dealt with quickly; and second, there are ways to overcome it. The first part is expressed simply enough in current articles in the most prestigious and reliable journals. Oxford professor of physics Raymond Pierrehumbert, a lead author of the recent IPCC report, opens his review of existing circumstances and options by writing: \u201cLet\u2019s get this on the table right away, without mincing words. With regard to the climate crisis, yes, it\u2019s time to panic.... We are in deep trouble.\u201d He then lays out the details carefully and scrupulously, reviewing the possible technical fixes and their very serious problems, concluding, \u201cThere\u2019s no plan B.\u201d We must move to zero net carbon emissions, and fast. The second part is spelled out in convincing detail in Bob\u2019s work, briefly reviewed here. The message must be conveyed in ways that do not induce despair and resignation among those inclined to accept it, and do not evoke resentment, anger and even greater rejection among those who do not accept what is in fact becoming overwhelmingly clear. In the latter case, it is necessary to understand the reasons \u2014 perhaps rejection of science altogether, or adopting economists\u2019 preference for market-based solutions which, whatever one thinks of them, are completely on the wrong time-scale, or the great many who expect the Second Coming, or those who think we will be rescued by some unknown technology or great figure, perhaps the colossus perceived by scholars at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, whose \u201cspirit seems to stride the country, watching us like a warm and friendly ghost\u201d (Ronald Reagan). The task will not be easy. It must be undertaken, urgently. By words and by actions, such as those being undertaken in the climate strikes of September 2019."

    "output": "Pollin:The Green New Deal has been gaining major support in the labor movement for several years now. There is still a long way to go, but progress is evident. For example, the coalition in Washington State that advanced a Green New Deal proposition in the 2018 election cycle was led by the visionary then president of the state AFL-CIO, Jeff Johnson. In the end, the initiative was defeated when oil companies flooded the airwaves with $30 million of virulent propaganda in the weeks before the November election. Similar initiatives are now being advanced in Colorado, again led by the state\u2019s mainstream labor leaders. Of course, we need to very quickly advance beyond just these few shining examples. What is critical here is that the climate movement must be firmly committed to a just transition as one component of the Green New Deal that is of equal significance with all the others. The climate movement needs to also be clear on the point that building the clean energy economy will be supportive of increasing job opportunities and rising living standards, as I am convinced it can be. There is no reason that the Green New Deal needs to be associated with austerity economic policies in any way. To the contrary, clean energy investments will create new opportunities for a wide range of small-scale public, cooperative, and private ownership forms. You don\u2019t need massive mining projects, pipelines or exploration platforms to deliver clean energy. Solar panels on roofs and in parking lots and wind turbines on farms can, by themselves, get us reasonably far along in meeting the energy needs of a growing egalitarian economy. From this perspective, the Green New Deal should rightfully be seen as offering a fully viable alternative to austerity economics along with the only realistic path for keeping us from becoming the 21st-century asteroid clone. This story is part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 220 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story."

However, looking at what his administration has done so far on both the domestic and international front, it is hard to see how his policies are contributing to the well-being and security of the United States. With that in mind, can you decode for us what Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy may be about with regard to international relations?",
    "output": "It is only natural to expect that policies will be designed for the benefit of the designers and their actual \u2014 not pretended \u2014 constituency, and that the well-being and security of the society will be incidental. And that is what we commonly discover. We might recall, for example, the frank comments on the Monroe Doctrine by Woodrow Wilson\u2019s Secretary of State, Robert Lansing: \u201cIn its advocacy of the Monroe Doctrine the United States considers its own interests. The integrity of other American nations is an incident, not an end. While this may seem based on selfishness alone, the author of the Doctrine had no higher or more generous motive in its declaration.\u201d The observation generalizes in international affairs, and much the same logic holds within the society. There is nothing essentially new about \u201cAmerica First,\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u201d does not mean America, but rather the designers and their actual constituency. typical illustration is the policy achievement of which the Trump-Ryan-McConnell administration is most proud: the tax bill \u2014 what Joseph Stiglitz accurately called \u201cThe US Donor Relief Act of 2017.\u201d It contributes very directly to the well-being of their actual constituency: private wealth and corporate power. It benefits the actual constituency indirectly by the standard Republican technique (since Reagan) of blowing up the deficit as a pretext for undermining social programs, which are the Republicans\u2019 next targets. The bill is thus of real benefit to its actual constituency and severely harms the general population. Turning to international affairs, in Trumpian lingo, \u201cAmerica First\u201d means \u201cme first\u201d and damn the consequences for the country or the world. The \u201cme first\u201d doctrine has an immediate corollary: it\u2019s necessary to keep the base in line with fake promises and fiery rhetoric, while not alienating the actual constituency. It also follows that it\u2019s important to do the opposite of whatever was done by Obama. Trump is often called \u201cunpredictable,\u201d but his actions are highly predictable on these simple principles. His most important decision, by far, was to pull out of the Paris negotiations on climate change and to tear to shreds efforts to prevent environmental catastrophe \u2014 a threat that is extremely severe, and not remote. All completely predictable on the basic principles just mentioned. The decision benefits the actual constituency: the energy corporations, the automotive industry (most of it), and others who pursue the imperative of short-term profit. Consider perhaps the most-respected and \u201cmoderate\u201d member of the Trump team, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, kicked out because he was too soft-hearted. We now know that ExxonMobil scientists were in the lead in the 1970s in recognizing the dire threat of global warming \u2014 facts surely known to the CEO, who presided over efforts to maximize the threat and to fund denialism of what the management knew was true \u2014 all to fill some overstuffed pockets with more dollars before we say \u201cgoodbye\u201d to organized human life, not in the distant future. It\u2019s hard to find a word in the language to describe such behavior. The decision also appeals to the pretended constituency: the voting base. Half of Republicans deny that global warming is taking place, and of the rest, a bare majority think that humans may have a role in it. It\u2019s doubtful that anything comparable exists elsewhere. And, of course, the decision reverses an Obama initiative, thus keeping to high principles. One cannot overemphasize the astonishing fact that the most powerful country in world history refuses to join the world in doing at least something \u2014 in some cases a lot \u2014 about this existential threat to organized human life (and to the species that are disappearing as the Sixth Extinction proceeds on its lethal course). And beyond that, is devoting its efforts to accelerating the race to disaster. And no less astonishing is the failure to highlight, even to discuss this extraordinary situation. Considering what is at stake, it is hard to find a historical parallel. The same hold pretty much on other policies, though sometimes with more elite opposition. Take Obama\u2019s Iran deal \u2014 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). That, of course, has to go, on pretexts too ludicrous to discuss, and always ignoring the fact that while Iran has been adhering to the agreement, the US has been violating it all along by acting to block Iran\u2019s reintegration into the global economy, particularly the global financial system, and to undermine \u201cthe normalisation of trade and economic relations with Iran.\u201d All in violation of the JCPOA, but of no concern, on the prevailing tacit assumption that \u201cthe indispensable nation\u201d stands above the law. considerable majority of Republicans have always opposed the deal, though in this case, Republican elites are often more realistic. The business world does not appear to have supported even the earlier sanctions regime \u2014 one of those interesting cases where state policy diverges from the interests of the actual constituency, much like Cuba policy. The decision harms the welfare and security of the general population, and might have truly horrendous consequences, but that is scarcely a consideration. The Trump team is working hard to maximize the likely disastrous effects. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made his first major speech at the ultra-reactionary Heritage Foundation, focusing on Iran, with demands so extreme that the goal must be to ensure that they are instantly rejected. Among them, that Iran withdraw its forces from Syria and end its support for Hezbollah and Hamas, and more generally, end its campaign \u201cto dominate the Middle East\u201d \u2014 newspeak for Iran\u2019s unwillingness to retreat into a shell and allow the US its traditional right to dominate the Middle East (and any other place it can) by force, with no impediments. Pompeo also warned the Europeans to join the US jihad, or else. There is some merit in Trump\u2019s posturing about how the JCPOA should be improved. It definitely can be. In particular, it can be extended to establishing a Nuclear Weapons-free Zone (NWFZ) in the Middle East, with serious inspections, which would eliminate any alleged threat of eventual Iranian nuclear programs. To achieve that goal should be quite straightforward. There is no need to obtain Iran\u2019s acquiescence. Iran has long been in the forefront of those calling for establishment of a NWFZ, particularly as the spokesperson for G-77 \u2014 the former non-aligned countries \u2014 which strongly advocates this development. The Arab states, with Egypt in the lead, initiated this proposal and have strongly urged that it be implemented. There is overwhelming international support. The matter regularly comes up in the review sessions of the Non-proliferation Treaty, with full agreement \u2014 almost. One country regularly blocks the effort, most recently Obama in 2015. The reason is not obscure: Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons systems must not be subject even to inspection, let alone steps toward dismantlement. It is important to add that the US and UK have a special responsibility to work to establish a Middle East NWFZ. They are committed to this goal by Security Council Resolution 687 \u2014 a commitment that takes on even greater force because it is this Resolution to which they appealed when seeking desperately to create some legal pretext for their criminal invasion of Iraq in 2003. But all of this is unmentionable, so we can put it aside. The Trump decision has infuriated much of the world, with the usual exceptions. In particular, it has infuriated European allies. Whether they will be willing to stand up against the global bully is unclear; it is a frightening prospect. If Europe does not proceed with the JCPOA, as the Trump wreckers hope, that might encourage Iranian hardliners to develop \u201cnuclear capability\u201d \u2014 a capacity to produce nuclear weapons if they ever decide to, which many non-nuclear states have. That might provide a green light for those who have been itching to bomb Iran for a long time, among them the new National Security Adviser John Bolton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Case by case, we find much the same, sometimes with further complexities."

But increasingly under Trump, the US is diplomatically weak and isolated. So why bother with diplomacy?",
    "output": "Incidentally, this is by no means a completely new departure. As its global power declined from its peak in the 1940s, the US has increasingly disregarded international institutions. During the years of its overwhelming global dominance, when the UN could be counted on to stay in line and serve as a weapon against adversaries, the UN was highly respected by elite opinion and Russia was berated for constantly saying \u201cno.\u201d As other industrial countries reconstructed from wartime devastation and decolonization proceeded on its agonizing course, the UN lost its allure. By the 1980s, respected intellectuals were pondering the strange cultural-psychological defect that was causing the world to be out of step. The US cast its first Security Council veto in 1970, and quickly gained the lead in doing so. It is the only country to have gone so far as to veto a Security Council resolution calling on all states to observe international law \u2014 mentioning no one, but it was understood that it was a response to Washington\u2019s rejection of World Court orders to end its \u201cunlawful use of force\u201d (aka international terrorism) against Nicaragua and to pay substantial reparations. The US rarely ratifies international conventions, and when it does, it is typically with crucial reservations, effectively exempting itself: the genocide and torture conventions, and many others. Rather generally, while Trump is carrying defiance of world opinion to new extremes, he can claim predecessors."

The move is strongly supported by Trump\u2019s Evangelical base \u2014 by now, the major popular support for Israel as more liberal sectors, as elsewhere in the world, are coming to oppose Israel\u2019s violence, repression and flagrant violations of international law. The move is also a gift to major Republican Party donors like Sheldon Adelson and Paul Singer. This decision, too, isolates the US in the world scene, harming the country in the longer term, but that is irrelevant. The US vetoed an otherwise unanimous Security Council resolution condemning the move, which is in violation of numerous [UN Security Council] resolutions on Jerusalem since 1968. The decision can be reversed."

    "input": "The North Korea nuclear saga has become a key global issue featuring the \u201crocket man\u201d and America\u2019s \u201cdotard.\u201d Do you see any prospects for a lasting peace between North and South Korea?",
    "output": "One possibility, advanced by China with broad international support, including North Korea intermittently, has been a double freeze: North Korea would freeze its development of nuclear weapons and missiles, and the US would cease its threatening military maneuvers on North Korea\u2019s borders, including menacing flights by the most advanced nuclear capable bombers \u2014 no laughing matter in a country that was flattened by merciless US bombing, even destruction of major dams (a serious war crime), within easy memory. The option has been rejected by the US. double freeze could have opened the way to further negotiations, perhaps reaching as far as what was achieved in 2005. Under international pressure, the Bush administration turned to negotiations, which achieved substantial success. North Korea agreed to abandon \u201call nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs\u201d and allow international inspections \u2014 phrases worth re-reading in the light of constant misrepresentation. In return, the US was to provide a light-water reactor for medical use, issue a non-aggression pledge, and join in an agreement that the two sides would \u201crespect each other\u2019s sovereignty, exist peacefully together and take steps to normalize relations.\u201d At once, the Bush administration broke the agreement. It renewed the threat of force, froze North Korean funds in foreign banks and disbanded the consortium that was to provide North Korea with a light-water reactor. Bruce Cumings, the leading US Korea scholar, writes that \u201cthe sanctions were specifically designed to destroy the September pledges [and] to head off an accommodation between Washington and Pyongyang.\u201d That path could be pursued again. On April 27, North and South Korea signed a historic document, the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula. It\u2019s worth reading carefully. In the Declaration, the two Koreas \u201caffirmed the principle of determining the destiny of the Korean nation on their own accord [repeat:on their own accord] ... to completely cease all hostile acts against each other in every domain [to] ... actively cooperate to establish a permanent and solid peace regime on the Korean Peninsula ... to carry out disarmament in a phased manner, [in order to achieve] the common goal of realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula ... to strengthen the positive momentum towards continuous advancement of inter-Korean relations as well as peace, prosperity and unification of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d They further \u201cagreed to actively seek the support and cooperation of the [international] community [meaning, the US] for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d Furthermore, as Korea specialist Chung-in Moon reviews in Foreign Affairs, the two sides did not just make high-level commitments. They also laid out specific timetables for implementing them and took concrete steps that would have immediate effects in facilitating cooperation and preventing conflict \u2014 something quite new and very significant. The import of the Declaration is clear. The US should back off and allow the two Koreas to achieve peace, disarmament, unification and complete denuclearization. We should accept the call for support and cooperation in this endeavor by the two parts of the Korean nation to determine its destiny \u201con their own accord.\u201d To put it more simply, the Declaration is a polite letter saying, \u201cDear Mr. Trump, declare victory if you want to prance around in public, but please go away and let us move towards peace, disarmament and unification without disrupting the process.\u201d US analysts have been clear and frank about the real nature of the North Korean threat. New York Times foreign affairs commentator Max Fisher writes that North Korea \u201chas achieved what no country has since China developed its own program a half-century ago: a nuclear deterrent against the United States,\u201d and Trump\u2019s threats and sanctions have not succeeded \u201cto stall or reverse those gains.\u201d Clearly, we must act to prevent anyone from deterring our resort to force and violence. It\u2019s worth noting that Iran poses a problem rather like that of North Korea. Among specialists, across the political spectrum, few would disagree with the conclusion of the respected and properly conservative International Institute of Strategic Studies in 2010 that \u201cIran\u2019s nuclear program and its willingness to keep open the possibility of developing nuclear weapons is a central part of its deterrent strategy.\u201d US intelligence concurs. Again, that is intolerable to the two rogue states that demand the right to rampage freely in the region, as they regularly do. If Trump and his advisers have any sense, they will seize the opportunity and accept the plea of the two Koreas. Unfortunately, expecting some sense may be too hopeful. The egregious hawk John Bolton, who has been just as publicly eager to bomb North Korea as Iran, went out of his way to bring up a model that he surely knew would infuriate and antagonize North Korea \u2014 the \u201cLibya model\u201d:You give up your deterrent, and then we will destroy you, ending with a brutal murder applauded with a vulgar joke by Hillary Clinton. Then Vice President Mike Pence chimed in saying it\u2019s not a mere threat but \u201cmore of a fact\u201d that \u201cthis will only end like the Libyan model ended if Kim Jong Un doesn\u2019t make a deal.\u201d Along with threatening military maneuvers at the North Korean borders, this is just the way to move negotiations forward. Predictably, there was a harsh verbal North Korean response, though coupled with some crucial actions: North Korea reported that it had just destroyed its key nuclear weapons testing site, setting off explosions to collapse underground tunnels. Trump responded a few hours later by cancelling the planned summit meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un. This not the end, however, and perhaps those who understand that Trump might register an ill-deserved triumph may prevail."

    "input": "Europe\u2019s key leaders seem to be distancing themselves with ever greater frequency from Washington\u2019s policies on global affairs. Do you think we may be at the start of a new era between European and American relations? This is something which many had expected to happen from the time of Charles de Gaulle all the way up to the reign of Mikhail Gorbachev, but perhaps the time has finally come. So, your take on this? Is the era of US hegemony and obedience to Washington\u2019s dictates nearing its end?",
    "output": "From the early postwar years, there was considerable concern in planning circles in Washington that Europe might move to become a \u201cthird force\u201d in global affairs, a neutralist bloc. De Gaulle was indeed the leading proponent of this conception, and a version was revived by Gorbachev in his call for a \u201cCommon European Home\u201d of cooperation and interchange from the Atlantic to the Urals, in which both NATO and the Warsaw Pact would be dismantled in favor of a pan-European security system. The idea was dismissed by the US in favor of expanding NATO, over the strong objections of George Kennan and other statesmen who warned, accurately enough, that this \u201cpolicy error of historic proportions\u201d would lead to rising and very ominous tensions on the Russian border. NATO\u2019s mission today, historian Richard Sakwa writes, is \u201cto manage the risks created by its existence.\u201d As to whether Europe today might move in an independent direction, I\u2019m skeptical. Despite Trump\u2019s moves to diminish and isolate America, and to alienate allies, and despite the exit of America\u2019s major advocate (Britain) from the European Union, I suspect that Europe will be unwilling to pose a serious challenge to Washington. Europe faces too many internal problems, and despite Trump, the US still remains unmatched as a global power, with means of violence and coercion that it is not reluctant to use, as the world knows all too well. But a lot remains uncertain. As the business press observes, The United States\u2019 \u201cability to impose financial sanctions around the world depends on the willingness of China and Europe to comply \u2014 and that may be waning.\u201d In the case of China, it has been waning rapidly. China has been moving to establish an international currency regime and trading system independent of the US. Trump\u2019s effort to destroy the Iran nuclear deal has infuriated the Europeans, who reacted at once by agreeing to invoke rules to shield European Union companies from US sanctions, to permit the European Investment Bank to finance business in Iran, and to encourage European countries to explore transfers to Iran\u2019s central bank, bypassing the US-dominated international financial system. These \u201cblocking mechanisms\u201d were last invoked in 1996, when Clinton sought to curb European investment in Cuba, Iran and Libya. Clinton backed down. But the world has changed. It\u2019s possible that Trump may succeed in creating a diminished America, hiding in fear behind walls, isolated and marginalized \u2014 though retaining plenty of guns to kill one another and a fearsome capacity to destroy at will."

Moreover, the country as a whole was shown to be completely unprepared for a major health crisis. Are we talking here not simply of an incompetent administration but also of a failed state?",
    "output": "Fifteenyears ago,I wrote a book calledFailed States, a common locution in the day, referring to states that are incapable of meeting the needs of citizens, in the most important case because of deep policy choices, and are a danger not only to their own citizens but the world. The prime example was the United States. Extensive evidence was reviewed. That\u2019s not of course the intended use of the phrase in the doctrinal system, just as \u201crogue state\u201d means some enemy, not ourselves, the prime example. I still stand by that judgment, which was not mine alone. A few years later, a Gallup/WINinternational poll found thatthe U.S.is regarded as the greatest threat to world peace, no one else even close.And the severe threats of government policy to the domestic population, already quite apparent when the book appeared, became much clearer a year later when the housing bubble burst and the financial crisis ensued \u2014 along with Obama\u2019s response: bail out the perpetrators, who became richer and more powerful than before, and forget about the congressional legislation that called for some help to the many who had lost their homes in corporate scams facilitated by theClinton-Rubin-Summers deregulationextravaganza, extending the neoliberal assault on the population that took off under Reagan. That\u2019s a large part of the background for what finally brought us the Trump malignancy \u2014 which may, quite literally, doom human society onEarth. We\u2019ve discussed elsewhere why this is no exaggeration. I hope that the basic facts and their dread import are well understood, and won\u2019t review them here. Trump has indeed hit America with a hammer blow \u2014 and much of the world as well, a matter we should not overlook. Just keeping to the currentCOVID-19 crisis, it is remarkable to see how little attention has been given to his sadistic assault against poor and suffering people around the world in pursuit of his goal of enhancing his electoral prospects. There has been some attention to his extending his vicious attacks against refugees fleeing from misery and oppression, appealing to a deluded voter base that has been led to believe that refugees are the source of their suffering under the programs to which Trump is passionately committed. But there is hardly a word about his attack against poor people in Africa, where unknown numbers will die thanks to hisdefunding of theWorld Health Organization(WHO), which has been protecting them from a wide range of diseases, now this new plague. Or aboutPalestinians in the occupied territories, victims of Israel\u2019s racistcontempt for their healthand other basic needs,amplified by Trump\u2019s defunding of their meager health, educational and support systems generally because \u2014 as he explained \u2014 they weren\u2019t treating him with enough respect while he\u2019s smashing them in the face. Trump\u2019s withholding funds from the WHO was just thefirst step in his campaign to destroy the organization.The campaignprovides real insight into the deeplyrooted malevolence not only of Trump but of the gang he has collected around him, most of whom cower in silence(though some speak out),sometimeseven outdoing the boss. Secretary of StateMikePompeohas been in the forefront of demonizing the WHO in support of Trump\u2019sincreasingly desperate efforts to find a scapegoat for his terrible crimes against Americans. It doesn\u2019t matterhow many miserable people are slaughtered in Africa and elsewhere in theGlobal South as crucial WHO services are undermined. Just \u201cshithole countries\u201d anyway, as the Dear Leader has explained. It is by now common understanding that the U.S.under Trump is a failed state that is a serious danger to the world. Diplomats speak in muted tones, not wanting to offend the raging beast in Washington who has unlimited power to destroy. But the meaning is clear when a \u201csenior European official\u201d says that\u201cThe U.S. administration is very fixated on the reelection campaignand on who can get blamed for this catastrophic Covid-19 situation in the U.S. They are blaming WHOand China for it.Thereforeit is very difficult to agree on a common language about the WHO.\u201d The \u201ccommon language\u201d in question has to do with a UN Security Council resolution that the Trump administration is blocking. The resolution calls for \u201caglobal ceasefirepertaining to armed conflict in response to the pandemic [and urges] member states to\u2018share timely and transparent information regarding the outbreak of COVID-19.\u2019\u201d But the resolution is unacceptable totheWhite House, because it calls on countries to \u201csupport the full implementation of the WHO International Health Regulations.\u201d As the senior European official said, asking countries to implement procedures to contain the crisis is harmful to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. In brief, the dedication to slaughter poor and suffering people in pursuit of personal gain is so profound that even reference to WHO health regulationscannot be mentioned. The WHO is reaching the status of climate change, a phrase that has to be excised from official documents dealing with the environment.Across the board, Trump and his acolytes are echoing the words ofFranciscoFranco\u2019s fascistGen.Mill\u00e1nAstray: \u201cDown with intelligence! Long live death!\u201d Turning directly to your question, I think\u201cincompetent\u201d is not the right word for Trump\u2019s malevolence, which turnedserious problems in the U.S.intoadevastating crisis.But we should not overlook the serious problems inherited by thecruelgang in today\u2019s White House. It\u2019s crucial to understand the background for the crisis if we hope to contain the next pandemic, likely to be worse than this one because of the impact of the global warming that is a far more severe threat. At the root, there are three factors: general capitalist logic, the morebrutalneoliberal variant, and reactions by individual governments. In 2003, after the SARS epidemic, scientists were well aware that a pandemic is likely, probably a related coronavirus. They also understood how to prepare for it \u2014 just asscientists today have a good idea as to how to preparefor the coming one. But it\u2019s not enough to know. Someone has to pick up the ball and run with it. The obvious candidate is Big Pharma, with huge resources, bloated with profits thanks to the exorbitant patent rights granted them under the highly protectionist \u201cfree trade\u201d agreements. They\u2019re ruled out, however, by normal capitalist logic. There\u2019s no profit in preparing for a catastrophe down the road. And in fact it can be in their interest toimpede a constructive response. Next, the government could step in, but that\u2019s blocked by the neoliberal intensification of capitalism\u2019s inherent inhumanity. As Reagan declaimed in hisinauguration speech, government is the problem, not the solution. Translation:Take decision-making away from government, which is at least partially responsive to public influence, and hand it over to private tyrannies that are unaccountable to the public.An essential component of neoliberalism, overt since its origins in interwar Vienna,is that democracy is a threat that must be contained, even destroyed by state violence if necessary, principles advocated in word and action by the gurus of the movement: Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek and others. Furthermore, as Milton Friedman counselled in the Reagan years, the unaccountable tyrannies who control decision-making must be guided by sheer greed. Any concern for others would shake the foundations of civilization. The creed was not strictly observed. Obama tried to evade it slightly, but the efforts were quickly smashed by capitalist logic (theventilator-Covidien affair that we\u2019ve discussed elsewhereis an example). But government intervention was largely blocked. The third factor is the reactions of individual governments. They varied. China very quickly provided the WHO and the world with all relevant information. By early January,Chinese scientists had identified the virus and sequenced the genome. Some countries at once reacted: Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, New Zealand, a few others,whichnow seem to have the crisis largely under control. Europe dithered but finally acted, with varying degrees of success. At the bottom of the barrel is Trump, reflecting his dedication to his primary constituency, private wealth and corporate power, lightly hidden under a farcical display of \u201cpopulism.\u201d Throughout his term in office,Trump has systematically pursued policies that enrich his primary constituency while harming others, including his adoring crowds. One part of this program was steadily defunding the Centersfor Disease Controland Prevention(CDC)and dismantling programs that could have provided advance warning of what was likely to happen. As a result,the U.S.was singularly unprepared. Though the U.S.and a few other failed states had all the information that led functioning societies to react appropriately, of course not all was entirely clear. That could hardly have been possible in such tumultuous circumstances. Like others, high U.S.health officials had someuncertaintyabout what exactly was happening and how best to handle it.Nevertheless, it was possible to take effective action, as shown by the record of governments that have some concern for their citizens.U.S.intelligence and health officials understood more than enough. Through January and February,they were trying to get through to the White House, but Trump was too busy watching his TV ratings. In the style of petty dictators, he has surrounded himself with sycophants or comical figures.So,nothing from them. Or from the Republican Party, now trembling in fear of the crowds that can be mobilized by Trump and his corporate sponsors. When some dare to inject a little rationality into administration discussions, they quickly learn their lessons, like the physician in charge of developing vaccines who wasdismissed in Aprilfor warning against one of the quack medicines that Trump was advertising. \u201cDown with intelligence! Long live death!\u201d Trump should be given credit for his considerable achievements. It\u2019s not easy to get away with holding up a banner with one hand saying \u201cI love you, I\u2019m our savior, I\u2019m chosen by heaven to protect you,\u201d while the other hand is stabbing you in the back. But Trump is doing it, brilliantly. He\u2019s the supreme con man, who makes P.T. Barnum look like an amateur. He\u2019s in a long tradition, back to trading tales for fun in the old West, to the self-declared King of France in Huckleberry Finn, to the guy who\u2019ll sell you the Brooklyn Bridge. Moving to a different sphere, we might also include thepresident who won the \u201cmarketer of the year\u201d awardfrom the Association of National Advertisers for his political campaign, easily defeating Apple and other amateurs,and went on to win a Nobel Peace Prize for some pleasant rhetoric. ButTrump is in a class by himself. Not just as a con man, but much more significantly as a dedicated enemy of the human race.That much is demonstrated by his policies on accelerating environmental catastrophe and dismantling the arms control regime that has provided some protection from terminal nuclear war, quite aside from a stream of peccadilloes of the kind already mentioned. While praising Trump for his considerable achievements, we must also bear in mind that the health system that he has been wrecking was already in terrible shape. The privatized profit-driven health system in the U.S.was an international scandal long before Trump, with costs about twice as high as comparable countries and some of the worst outcomes. On the eve of the pandemic,the costs of this dysfunctional system were estimated at$450 billion in wasted expenseand 68,000 deaths annually byTheLancet, one of the world\u2019s leading medical journals. Beyond that, the neoliberal business model dictates that hospital care must be \u201cefficient\u201d: the minimum number of nurses and hospital beds to just get by in normal times \u2014 not much fun for patients even in normal times even at the world\u2019s best hospitals, as many can attest (myself included). And if anything goes wrong, tough luck. It should be added that contrary to common belief, the U.S.does have universal health care. It\u2019s called \u201cemergency rooms.\u201d If you can drag yourself to one, they\u2019ll take care of you, often with superb care \u2014 and often a hefty bill. It\u2019s the most cruel and expensive form of universal care known, but at least it\u2019s there. Bad as the situation was that Trump inherited, he has been committed to making it worse. One illustration of the commitments (and moral level) of the White House is the budget it submitted for the coming year on February 10, while the pandemic was raging. It called for still further cuts for theCDCalong with increased subsidies to the fossil fuel industries that are driving us to final catastrophe. And,of course,more funding for the bloated military and for the famouswall that will protect us from the rapists and murderers surging across the border."

    "output": "We have enough experience to see that virtually everything Trump does is about himself\u2014 the country and the world be damned. In this case, one can detect a strategy behind the ongoing circus. Trump has been casting about to find someone to blame for his crimes. After evoking theYellow Periland laboring to destroy the WHO, with grim effects, he\u2019s pretty much run out of targets. A rational next step is to tell governors that it\u2019s your business: thefederal government, which has all the resources, can\u2019t do anything for you. If anything goes wrong, it\u2019s your fault, not mine. And if something happens to go right somewhere, it demonstrates what a stable genius I am, and will be trumpeted by Sean Hannity as the most brilliant decision in human history. This is similar to the strategy of saying one thing today and the opposite tomorrow, each echoed rapturously byFox Newswhile the liberal press dutifully tots up the lies (20,000?). If you shoot arrows at random, some may hit the target. And if one does? I\u2019m vindicated and the scam goes on. You can\u2019t lose. The governors\u2019 ploy is about the same: enforce lockdown, open up the economy (and protect our \u201cSecondAmendment rights,\u201d which has nothing to do with anything but pushes the right buttons). If it makes life harder for the governors and leads to many deaths, that\u2019s OK too. It\u2019s all the fault of the urban centers where diseases and other maladies fester among those who are poisoning our lily\u2013white society. Malevolent, but not stupid. It\u2019s tempting to add the injunction to the states byMitch McConnell, the real evil genius of the Republican organization. Go bankrupt. The Republican Senate is not going to compensate you for your foolish decision to give pensions to firefighters, teachers, policemen and other undeserving takers. We have to save the money for the makers, like the airline industries that need $50 billion because in the glory days of high profits, instead of improving services and building the enterprises, they spent close to $50 billion in buybacks to inflate stock prices and compensation for management. After all, first things first. There\u2019s no need to elaborate. His vileness has been so egregious that there\u2019s been plenty of commentary in themainstreampress. In defense of Trump, McConnell and rest of the merry gang, they are carrying to an extreme the only way of dealing with the dilemma that the Republicans have faced since they turned to pure service to the business world. It\u2019s hard to go to voters and say, \u201cLook, we\u2019re the more extreme of the two business parties. We\u2019re designing policies to benefit our primary constituency of great wealth and corporate power, and to throw you into the waste bin.Sovote for us.\u201d Somehow, that doesn\u2019t work well.Soit\u2019s important to divert attention to \u201ccultural issues,\u201d to pretend to be adamantlyopposed toabortion rightsand love assault rifles, to be terrified ofthem, to dismiss global warming as a Commie plot, and all the rest. The word \u201cpretend\u201d is quite appropriate, but I won\u2019t go into that here. The Democratic establishment has its own sins to answer for, but it is nothing like this; more like the moderate Republicans of the days before the Gingrich-Hastert-McConnell era. And it is subject to popular pressures, which have moved the party considerably to the left in recent years. That\u2019s not insignificant."

Current statistics show that he seems to be back to his norm of approval, which hasn\u2019tvaried a great deal through his term. And if it looks bad, they might pull something before November. Like concocting an incident and bombing Iran."

These matters are explored in depth in scholarly work byRobert McChesneyandVictor Pickard, who carry the discussion right to the 20thcentury struggles to join the world in having vibrant public media, a critical matter for media activists today. That\u2019s dangerous turf. Better to destroy the virus of democracy before it infects too many people."

    "input": "Many on theleft feel, naturally, and with much justification, extremely uncomfortable about Joe Biden. In fact, we hear now from some quarters the same arguments we heard in 2016 about Hillary Clinton, which is to say that it would be unconscionable for progressives to accept the\u201clesser of two evils\u201dprinciple.How can we understand the political and conceptual context of electoral choices made byprogressives and theleft in November 2020?",
    "output": "These questions are plainly important. They are a matter of intense discussion and often impassioned debate on the left, and plenty of invective. That makes them worth discussing. To be quite frank, I don\u2019t see much other reason for discussing them. I\u2019ve tried to explain in recent interviews, and judging by the reactions, have failed.So,I will repeat in more detail. I\u2019ve been around for a long time and can\u2019t think of a candidate about whom I was not \u201cextremely uncomfortable,\u201d at least since FDR (and I was too young to have considered opinions then). In Biden\u2019s case it\u2019s easy to think of reasons to be extremely uncomfortable. We can begin with his participation in the destruction of Libya and Honduras, in Obama\u2019s global assassination campaign, in breaking all records in deportation \u2014 and on from there. But while continuing with constant efforts to change that world, we have to take off a few minutes toeach make our own choiceson election day. Let\u2019s think through the two concepts that lie behind the question: \u201cunconscionable\u201d and \u201clesser of two evils principle.\u201d Let\u2019s start with \u201cunconscionable.\u201d There are those \u2014 including close personal friends and long-time activists whom I greatly respect \u2014 who take the position that some actions are simply \u201cunconscionable,\u201d whatever the consequences. I will ignore this position. To me, frankly, it seems not worth discussing. In the moral domain, what matters is the predictable consequences of your actions, those youare well aware of but choose to ignore. No one cares if you feel your conscience is clear. Let\u2019s turn tothelesser of two evils principle. Throughout my lifetime of activism (almost 80 years), I\u2019ve been familiar with two doctrines about voting. One is the official doctrine. Official doctrineholds that politics consists of showing up every few years, pushing a lever, then going back to one\u2019s private pursuits. Citizens are \u201cspectators,\u201d not \u201cparticipants in action,\u201d according to official doctrine. They can choose one or another member of the leadership class (\u201cthe responsible men\u201d) but that\u2019s the limit of popular participation. I happen to be quoting Walter Lippmann,arespected public intellectual of the 20thcentury(a Wilson-FDR-JFK liberal),in his \u201cprogressive essays in democracy,\u201d but the ideas are representative of prevailing liberal opinion. They trace back to theframers of the Constitution. That\u2019s why the \u201cgold standard\u201d in constitutional scholarship, a fine and illuminating studybyMichael Klarman, is called \u201cThe Framers\u2019 Coup\u201d \u2014 a coup against the popular demand for democracy. On the right, views are much harsher. second doctrine is the one that has always prevailed on the left, call it\u201cleft doctrine.\u201dPolitics consists in constant direct popular engagement in public affairs, including a wide variety of activism on many fronts. Occasionally anevent comes up in the formal political arena called an \u201celection.\u201d For left activists, that requires spending a brief period assessing the options (a very brief period for legitimate activists, who\u2019ve been following everything relevant closely). Then comes a decision as to whether it\u2019s worthwhile to take a few minutes away from ongoing political work to push a lever in the quadrennial extravaganza. It\u2019s at most a brief departure from political engagement. That\u2019s the doctrine that I\u2019ve followed all my life, sometimes abstaining because the show didn\u2019t seem to matter and there\u2019s no point legitimizing the charade by participating, sometimes voting for a third party, sometimes voting for Jones if it\u2019s important to block Smith. I\u2019ve sometimes voted for a Republican, in years when the Republicans were still a bone fide political party and had a better candidate. There are, of course, myriad other cases, but the general point ofleft doctrineseems clear. In recent years,a third doctrine has made an appearance and is now consuming much debate on the left:thelesser of two evils principle. I\u2019d never heard of it before, in a lifetime of intensive political engagement (in theleft doctrinesense).And it seems quite strange to me. It obviously is quite different fromleft doctrine, the prevailing doctrine on the left. The intensive debate about it falls within official doctrine, with its laser-like focus on the elections. My own feeling aboutthelesser of two evils principle, of course, is that we should reject it in favor ofleft doctrine. It has no merits that I can see, so I think we can put it aside, along with the often\u2013fevered debate about it. Let\u2019s now consider the immediate case in hand. Ifthe traditionalleft doctrine were applied to the current situation, it would requirecomparing Trump and his entourage with Biden and his,and askingwhether there is a difference between them. Ipersonallythink the difference is colossal. First and decisive, another four years of Trump and we\u2019ll have approached or possibly passed tipping points on the path toward environmental catastrophe toward which Trump is racing, his \u201cparty\u201d in tow, virtually isolated in the world, certainly in the political system here. Just as important, the arms control regime will be dismantled, sharply increasing the threat of terminal war. The severe threats that Trump has incited in the Middle East will have increased, if not exploded. The Doomsday Clock, already reduced to seconds under Trump, will probably be close to abandoned. The reactionary international led by the White House that Trump is establishing will be well solidified. At home, the judiciary will be so packed by ultra-right young judges that no progressive initiatives will be able to be implemented for a generation. By the wayside we\u2019ll be observing other horrors, like children sent to concentration camps on the border,Blackpeoplemurdered on a whim, etc. An advocate ofleft doctrinewill spend a few minutes reviewing the familiar facts, then take off another few minutes to push a lever, then go back to work. I know of only one proposed counterargument. We have to put pressure on the Democratic establishment. To begin with, it\u2019s not a counterargument. It simply reiterates the main thesis ofleft doctrine: constant pressure. The only remaining question is how to impose pressure. There are, basically, two proposals on the table. The first isleft doctrine. The second is refusing to vote for Biden. Let\u2019s take a look at these. First,left doctrine. We continue with what has been done, and has been very effective. One illustration is the Sanders campaign, which has been a remarkable success in shifting debate and policy choices to the left. The activism of the Sunrise Movement\u2014aided by young congresswomen brought to office in the Sanders wave, notably Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2014has brought to the legislativeagenda a Green New Deal, with the cooperation of liberal Democrat Ed Markey,senator from Massachusetts. Some version of a Green New Deal is essential for survival. There have also been significant shifts in other areas (health care, minimum wage, harsh repression invulnerablecommunities, women\u2019s rights, on and on). We can, in fact, see this in Biden\u2019s program, which is well to the left of previous Democratic front-runners. That\u2019s why Biden is supported against Trump by Sanders (who had a large role in bringingthe shift about) and also by longtime labor activists like LawrenceMisheland Jared Bernstein. It\u2019s not my program, or yours, but we can hardly doubt that it is an improvement over what preceded. Left doctrineefforts can work, as they often have before. We all know that that has been the main source of progress over the years, particularly when there were administrations susceptible to activist pressure. It could be argued that political programs are just words. True, but irrelevant.Left doctrineefforts can keep Biden\u2019s feet to the fire, as has often happened in the past. And there will be opportunities to go far beyond, an urgent necessity. In contrast, we can be sure that a Trump administration will be rock solid in opposition. The second approach is to refuse to vote for Biden in the hope that withholding the vote will convince the Democratic establishment to take us seriously down the road.I can\u2019t honestly construct a plausible version of this view, and it would be unfair to try. Turning finally to your question, \u201cHow can we understand the political and conceptual context of electoral choices made by progressives and the left in November 2020?\u201d To me the answer seems clear. We shouldassess whether there is meaningfuldifference betweenthe candidates, and also recognize that, for most of us, voting takesa few minutes.Thenwego back toour real activistwork."

With nearly 3,000 dead, this was the deadliest attack on U.S. soil in history and produced dramatic ramifications for global affairs, as well as startling impacts on domestic society. I want to start by asking you to reflect on the alleged revamping of U.S. foreign policy under George W. Bush as part of his administration\u2019s reaction to the rise of Osama bin Laden and the jihadist phenomenon. First, was there anythingnew to theBush Doctrine, or was it simply a codification of what we had already seen take place in the 1990s in Iraq, Panama, Bosnia and Kosovo? Second, was the U.S.-NATO led invasion of Afghanistan legal under international law? And third, was the U.S. ever committed to nation-building in Afghanistan?",
    "output": "Washington\u2019s immediate reaction to 9/11/2001 was to invade Afghanistan. The withdrawal of U.S. ground forces was timed to (virtually) coincide with the 20th anniversary of the invasion. There has been a flood of commentary on the 9/11 anniversary and the termination of the ground war. It is highly illuminating, and consequential. It reveals how the course of events is perceived by the political class, and provides useful background for considering the substantive questions about the Bush Doctrine. It also yields some indication of what is likely to ensue. Of utmost importance at this historic moment would be the reflections of \u201cthe decider,\u201d as he called himself. And indeed, there was an interview with George W. Bush as the withdrawal reached its final stage, in theWashington Post. In the Style section. The article and interview introduce us to a lovable, goofy grandpa, enjoying banter with his children, admiring the portraits he had painted of Great Men that he had known in his days of glory. There was an incidental comment on his exploits in Afghanistan and the follow-up episode in Iraq: Bush may havestarted the Iraq War on false pretenses, but at least he hadn\u2019t inspired an insurrection that turned the U.S. Capitol into a combat zone. At least he had made efforts todistance himself from the racists and xenophobesin his party rather than cultivate their support. At least he hadn\u2019t gone so far as tocall hisdomesticadversaries \u201cevil.\u201d \u201cHe looks like the Babe Ruth of presidents when you compare him to Trump,\u201d former Senate Majority Leader and one-time Bush nemesis Harry M. Reid (D-Nevada) said in an interview. \u201cNow, I look back on Bush with a degree of nostalgia, with some affection, which I never thought I would do.\u201d Way down on the list, meriting only incidental allusion, is the slaughter of hundreds of thousands; many millions of refugees; vast destruction; a regime of hideous torture; incitement of ethnic conflicts that have torn the whole region apart; and as a direct legacy, two of the most miserable countries on Earth. First things first. He didn\u2019t bad-mouth fellow Americans. The sole interview with Bush captures well the essence of the flood of commentary. What matters isus. There are many laments about the cost of these ventures:the cost to us, that is, which \u201chave exceeded $8 trillion, according to new estimates by the Costs of War project at Brown University,\u201dalong with American lives lost and disruption of our fragile society. Next time we should assess the costs to us more carefully, and do better. There are also well-justified laments about the fate of women under Taliban rule. The laments sometimes are no doubt sincere, though a natural question arises: Why weren\u2019t they voiced 30 years ago when U.S. favorites, armed and enthusiastically supported by Washington, were terrorizing young women in Kabul who were wearing the \u201cwrong\u201d clothes, throwing acid in their faces and other abuses? Particularly vicious were the forces of the arch-terrorist,Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, recently on the U.S. negotiating team. The achievements in women\u2019s rights in Russian-controlled cities in the late \u201880s, and the threats they faced from the CIA-mobilized radical Islamist forces, were reported at the time by a highly credible source, Rasil Basu, a distinguished international feminist activist who was UN representative in Afghanistan in those years, with special concern for women\u2019s rights. Basureports: During the [Russian] occupation, in fact, women made enormous strides: illiteracy declined from 98% to 75%, and they were granted equal rights with men in civil law, and in the Constitution. This is not to say that there was complete gender equality. Unjust patriarchal relations still prevailed in the workplace and in the family with women occupying lower level sex-type jobs. But the strides they took in education and employment were very impressive. Basu submitted articles on these matters to the major U.S. journals, along with the feminist journalMs. Magazine.No takers, wrong story. She was, however, able to publish her report in Asia:Asian Age, on December 3, 2001. We can learn more about how Afghans in Kabul perceive the late years of the Russian occupation, and what followed, from another expert source, Rodric Braithwaite, British ambassador to Moscow from 1988 to 1992, and then chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, also author of the major scholarly work on the Soviets in Afghanistan. Braithwaite visited Kabul in 2008, and reported his findings in the LondonFinancial Times: In Afghanistan today new myths are building up. They bode ill for current western policy. On a recent visit I spoke to Afghan journalists, former Mujahideen, professionals, people working for the \u2018coalition\u2019 \u2014 natural supporters for its claims to bring peace and reconstruction. They were contemptuous of [US-imposed] President Hamid Karzai, whom they compared to Shah Shujah, the British puppet installed during the first Afghan war. Most preferred Mohammad Najibullah, the last communist president, who attempted to reconcile the nation within an Islamic state, and was butchered by the Taliban in 1996: DVDs of his speeches are being sold on the streets. Things were, they said, better under the Soviets. Kabul was secure, women were employed, the Soviets built factories, roads, schools and hospitals, Russian children played safely in the streets. The Russian soldiers fought bravely on the ground like real warriors, instead of killing women and children from the air. Even the Taliban were not so bad: they were good Muslims, kept order, and respected women in their own way. These myths may not reflect historical reality, but they do measure a deep disillusionment with the \u2018coalition\u2019 and its policies. The policies of the \u201ccoalition\u201d were brought to the public inNew York Timescorrespondent Tim Weiner\u2019s history of the CIA. The goal was to \u201ckill Soviet Soldiers,\u201d the CIA station chief in Islamabad declared, making it clear that \u201cthe mission was not to liberate Afghanistan.\u201d His understanding of the policies he was ordered to execute under President Ronald Reagan is fully in accord withthe boasts of President Jimmy Carter\u2019s National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinskiabout their decision to support radical Islamist jihadis in 1979 in order to draw the Russians into Afghanistan, and his pleasure in the outcome after hundreds of thousands of Afghans were killed and much of the country wrecked: \u201cWhat is more important in world history? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire? Some agitated Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the cold war?\u201d It was recognized early on by informed observers that the Russian invaders were eager to withdraw without delay.The study of Russian archives by historian David Gibbsresolves any doubts on the matter. But it was much more useful for Washington to issue rousing proclamations about Russia\u2019s terrifying expansionist goals, compelling the U.S., in defense, to greatly expand its own domination of the region, with violence when needed (the Carter Doctrine, a precursor of the Bush Doctrine). The Russian withdrawal left a relatively popular government in place under Najibullah, with a functioning army that was able to hold its own for several years until the U.S.-backed radical Islamists took over and instituted a reign of terror so extreme that the Taliban were widely welcomed when they invaded, instituting their own harsh regime. They kept on fairly good terms with Washington until 9/11. Returning to the present, we should indeed be concerned with the fate of women, and others, as the Taliban return to power. For those sincerely concerned to design policies that might benefit them, a little historical memory doesn\u2019t hurt."

    "input": "The same is true in other respects as well. The Taliban have promised not to harbor terrorists, but how can we believe them, commentators warn, when this promise is coupled with the outrageous claim by their spokesmanZabihullah Mujahidthat there is \u201cno proof\u201d that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the 9/11 attack?",
    "output": "There is one problem with the general ridicule of this shocking statement. What Mujahid actually said was both accurate and very much worth hearing. In his words,\u201cWhen Osama bin Laden became an issue for the Americans, he was in Afghanistan. Although there was no proof he was involved\u201d in 9/11. Let\u2019s check. In June 2002, eight months after 9/11, FBI Director Robert Mueller made his most extensive presentation to the national press about the results of what was probably the most intensive investigation in history.In his words,\u201cinvestigators believe the idea of the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon came from al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan,\u201d though the plotting and financing apparently trace to Germany and the United Arab Emirates. \u201cWe think the masterminds of it were in Afghanistan, high in the al Qaeda leadership.\u201d What was only surmised in June 2002 could not have been known eight months earlier when the U.S. invaded. Mujahid\u2019s outrageous comment was accurate. The ridicule is another example of convenient amnesia. Keeping Mujahid\u2019s accurate statement in mind, along with Mueller\u2019s confirmation of it, we can move towards understanding the Bush Doctrine. While doing so, we might listen to Afghan voices. One of the most respected was Abdul Haq, the leading figure in the anti-Taliban Afghan resistance and a former leader of the U.S.-backed Mujahideen resistance to the Russian invasion. A few weeks after the U.S. invasion, he hadan interview with Asia scholar Anatol Lieven. Haq bitterly condemned the U.S. invasion,which, he recognized, would kill many Afghans and undermine the efforts to overthrow the Taliban from within. He said that \u201cthe US is trying to show its muscle, score a victory and scare everyone in the world. They don\u2019t care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many people we will lose.\u201d Haq was not alone in this view. A meeting of 1,000 tribal elders in October 2001 unanimously demanded an end to the bombing, which, they declared, is targeting \u201cinnocent people.\u201d They urged that means other than slaughter and destruction be employed to overthrow the hated Taliban regime. The leading Afghan women\u2019s rights organization, Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA), issued a declaration on October 11, 2001, strongly opposing the \u201cvast aggression on our country\u201d by the U.S., which will shed the blood of innocent civilians. The declaration called for \u201ceradication of the plague of the Taliban and al-Qaeda\u201d by the \u201cuprising of the Afghan nation,\u201d not by a murderous assault of foreign aggressors. All public at the time, all ignored as irrelevant, all forgotten. The opinions of Afghans are not our concern when we invade and occupy their country. The perception of the anti-Taliban Afghan resistance was not far from the stance of PresidentBush and his Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Both dismissed Taliban initiatives to send bin Laden for trial abroad despite Washington\u2019s refusal to provide evidence (which it didn\u2019t have). Finally, they refused Taliban offers to surrender. As the president put it, \u201cWhen I said no negotiations, I meant no negotiations.\u201dRumsfeld added, \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate surrenders.\u201d E.g.,we\u2019re going to show our muscle and scare everyone in the world. The imperial pronouncement at the time was that those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. The shocking audacity of that proclamation passed almost unnoticed. It was not accompanied by a call to bomb Washington, as it obviously implied. Even putting aside the world-class terrorists in high places, the U.S.harbors and abets retail terroristswho keep to such acts as blowing up Cuban commercial airliners, killing many people, part of the long U.S. terrorist war against Cuba. Quite apart from that scandal, it is worth stating the unspeakable: The U.S. had no charge against the Taliban. No charge, before 9/11 or ever. Before 9/11, Washington was on fairly good terms with the Taliban. After 9/11, it demanded extradition (without even a pretense of providing required evidence), and when the Taliban agreed, Washington refused the offers: \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate surrenders.\u201d The invasion was not only a violation of international law, as marginal a concern in Washington as the anti-Taliban Afghan resistance, but also had no credible pretext on any grounds. Pure criminality. Furthermore, ample evidence is now available showing that Afghanistan and al-Qaeda were not of much interest to the Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld triumvirate. They had their eyes on much bigger game than Afghanistan. Iraq would be the first step, then the entire region. I won\u2019t review the record here. It\u2019s well-documented in Scott Horton\u2019s book,Fool\u2019s Errand. That\u2019s the Bush Doctrine. Rule the region, rule the world, show our muscle so that the world knows that \u201cWhat we say goes,\u201d as Bush I [George H.W. Bush] put it. It\u2019s hardly a new U.S. doctrine. It\u2019s also easy to find precursors in imperial history. Simply consider our predecessor in world control, Britain, a grand master of war crimes, whose wealth and power derived from piracy, slavery and the world\u2019s greatest narco-trafficking enterprise. And in the last analysis,\u201cWhatever happens, we have got, The Maxim gun, and they have not.\u201d Hilaire Belloc\u2019s rendition of Western civilization. And pretty much Abdul Haq\u2019s insight into the imperial mindset. Nothing reveals reigning values more clearly than the mode of withdrawal. The Afghan population was scarcely a consideration. The imperial \u201cdeciders\u201d do not trouble to ask what people might want in the rural areas of this overwhelmingly rural society where the Taliban live and find their support, perhaps grudging support as the best of bad alternatives. Formerly a Pashtun movement, the \u201cnew Taliban\u201d evidently have a much broader base. That was dramatically revealed bythe quick collapse of their former enemies, the vicious warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, along with Ismail Khan, bringing other ethnic groups within the Taliban network. There are also Afghan peace forces that should not be summarily dismissed. What would the Afghan population want if they had a choice? Could they, perhaps, reach local accommodations if given time before a precipitous withdrawal? Whatever the possibilities might have been, they do not seem to have been considered. The depth of contempt for Afghans was, predictably, reached by Donald Trump. In his unilateral withdrawal agreement with the Taliban in February 2020, he did not even bother to consult with the official Afghan government. Worse still,Bush administration foreign policy specialist Kori Schake reports, Trumpforced the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban fighters and relax economic sanctions. He agreed that the Taliban could continue to commit violence against the government we were there to support, against innocent people and against those who\u2019d assisted our efforts to keep Americans safe. All the Taliban had to do was say they would stop targeting U.S. or coalition forces, not permit al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations to use Afghan territory to threaten U.S. security and subsequently hold negotiations with the Afghan government. As usual, what matters isus, this time amplified by Trump\u2019s signature cruelty. The fate of Afghans is of zero concern. Trumptimed the withdrawal for the onset of the summer fighting season, reducing the hope for some kind of preparation. President Joe Biden improved the terms of withdrawal a little, but not enough to prevent theanticipated debacle. Then came the predictable reaction of the increasingly shameless Republican leadership. They were barely able to remove their gushing tributes to Trump\u2019s \u201chistoric peace agreement\u201d from their web page in time to denounce Biden and call for his impeachment for pursuing an improved version of Trump\u2019s ignominious betrayal. Meanwhile, the Afghans are again hung out to dry. Returning to the original question, the Bush Doctrine may have been formulated more crudely than the usual practice, but it is hardly new. The invasion violated international law (and Article VI of the U.S. Constitution), but Bush\u2019s legal team had determined that such sentimentality was \u201cquaint\u201d and \u201cobsolete,\u201d again breaking little new ground except for brazen defiance. As to \u201cnation building,\u201d one way to measurethe commitment to this goal is to ask what portion of the trillions of dollars expended went to the Afghan population, and what portion went to the U.S.military system and its mercenaries (\u201ccontractors\u201d) along with the morass of corruption in Kabul and the warlords the U.S.established in power. At the outset, I referred to 9/11/2001, not just 9/11. There\u2019s a good reason. What we call 9/11 is the second 9/11. The first 9/11 was far more destructive and brutal by any reasonable measure: 9/11/73. To see why, consider per capita equivalents, the right measure. Suppose that on 9/11/2001, 30,000 people had been killed, 500,000 viciously tortured, the government overthrown and a brutal dictatorship installed. That would have been worse than what we call 9/11. It happened. It wasn\u2019t deplored by the U.S. government, or by private capital, or by the international financial institutions that the U.S. largely controls, or by the leading figures of \u201clibertarianism.\u201d Rather, it was lauded and granted enormous support. The perpetrators, like Henry Kissinger, are highly honored. I suppose bin Laden is lauded among jihadis. All should recognize that I am referring to Chile, 9/11/1973. Another topic that might inspire reflection is the notion of \u201cforever wars,\u201d finally put to rest with the withdrawal from Afghanistan. From the perspective of the victims, when did the forever wars begin? For the United States, they began in 1783. With the British yoke removed, the new nation was free to invade \u201cIndian country,\u201d to attack Indigenous nations with campaigns of slaughter, terror, ethnic cleansing, violation of treaties \u2014 all on a massive scale, meanwhile picking up half of Mexico, then onto much of the world. A longer view traces our forever wars back to 1492, as historian Walter Hixson argues. From the viewpoint of the victims, history looks different from the stance of those with the maxim gun and their descendants."

    "input": "In March 2003, the U.S. initiated a war against Iraq as part of the neoconservative vision of remaking the Middle East and removing leaders that posed a threat to the interests and \u201cintegrity\u201d of the United States. Knowing that the regime of Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the 9/11 terrorist attacks, possessed no weapons of mass destruction and subsequently posed no threat to the U.S., why did Bush invade Iraq,which left hundreds of thousands of Iraqis deadand may have cost more than $3 trillion?",
    "output": "9/11 provided the occasion for the invasion of Iraq, which, unlike Afghanistan, is a real prize: a major petro-state right at the heart of the world\u2019s prime oil-producing region. As the twin towers were still smoldering, Rumsfeld was telling his staff that it\u2019s time to \u201cgo massive \u2014 sweep it all up, things related and not,\u201d including Iraq. Goals quickly became far more expansive. Bush and associates made it quite clear that bin Laden was small potatoes, of little interest (see Horton for many details). The Bush legal team determined that the UN Charter, which explicitly bars preemptive/preventive wars, actually authorizes them \u2014 formalizing what had long been operative doctrine.The official reason for war was the \u201csingle question\u201d: Hussein\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. When the question received the wrong answer, the reason for aggression instantly switched to \u201cdemocracy promotion,\u201d a transparent fairy tale swallowed enthusiastically by the educated classes \u2014 though some demurred, including 99 percent of Iraqis, according to polls. Some are now praised for having opposed the war from the start, notably Barack Obama, who criticized it as a strategic blunder. Perhaps my memory is faulty, but I don\u2019t recall praise for Nazi generals who regarded Hitler\u2019s Operation Barbarossa as a strategic blunder: They should have knocked out Britain first. A different judgment was rendered by the Nuremberg Tribunal. But the U.S. doesn\u2019t commit crimes, by definition; only blunders."

But as in the case of Iraq, what were the real reasons for dealing with the leader of an alleged \u201crogue state\u201d that had long ceased being one?",
    "output": "The Libya intervention was initiated by France, partly in reaction to humanitarian posturing of some French intellectuals, partly I suppose (we don\u2019t have much evidence) as part of France\u2019s effort to sustain its imperial role in Francophone Africa. Britain joined in. Then Obama-Clinton joined, \u201cleading from behind\u201d as some White House official is supposed to have said. As Qaddafi\u2019s forces were converging on Benghazi, there were loud cries of impending genocide, leading to a UN Security Council resolution imposing a no-fly zone and calling for negotiations. That was reasonable in my opinion; there were legitimate concerns. The African Union proposed a ceasefire with negotiations with the Benghazi rebel about reforms.Qaddafi accepted it; the rebels refused. At that point, the France-Britain-U.S. coalition decided to violate the Security Council resolution they had introduced and to become, in effect, the air force of the rebels. That enabled the rebel forces to advance on ground, finally capturing and sadistically murdering Qaddafi. Hillary Clinton found that quite amusing, and joked with the press that, \u201cWe came, We saw, He died.\u201d The country then collapsed into total chaos, with sharp escalation in killings and other atrocities. It also led to a flow of jihadis and weapons to other parts of Africa, stirring up major disasters there. Intervention extended to Russia and Turkey, and the Arab dictatorships, supporting warring groups. The whole episode has been a catastrophe for Libya and much of West Africa. Clinton is not on record, as far as I know, as to whether this is also amusing. Libya was a major oil producer. It\u2019s hard to doubt that that was a factor in the various interventions, but lacking internal records, little can be said with confidence."

    "input": "The debacle in Afghanistan has shown beyond any doubt the failure of U.S. strategy in the war on terror and of the regime-change operations. However, there is something more disturbing than these facts, which is that, after each intervention, the United States leaves behind \u201cblack holes\u201d and even betrays those that fought on its side against terrorism. Two interrelated questions: First, do you think that the failed war on terror will produce any new lessons for future U.S. foreign policymakers? And second, does this failure reveal anything about U.S. supremacy in world affairs?",
    "output": "Failure is in the eyes of the beholder. Let\u2019s first recall thatBush II didn\u2019t declare the global war on terror. He re-declared it.It was Reagan and his Secretary of State George Shultz who came into office declaring the global war on terror, a campaign to destroy the \u201cthe evil scourge of terrorism,\u201d particularly state-backed international terrorism, a \u201cplague spread by depraved opponents of civilization itself [in a] return to barbarism in the modern age.\u201d The global war on terror quickly became a huge terrorist war directed or supported by Washington,concentrating on Central America but extending to the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The global war on terror even led to a World Court judgment condemning the Reagan administration for \u201cunlawful use of force\u201d\u2014aka,international terrorism\u2014and ordering the U.S.to pay substantial reparations forits crimes. The U.S.of course dismissed all of this and stepped up the \u201cunlawful use of force.\u201d That was quite proper, the editors ofThe New York Timesexplained. The World Court was a \u201chostile forum,\u201d as proven by the fact that it condemned the blameless U.S. A few years earlier it had been a model of probity when it sided with the U.S.in a case against Iran. The U.S.then vetoed a Security Council resolution calling on all states to observe international law, mentioning no one,although it was clear what was intended. I\u2019m not sure whether it was even reported. But we solemnly declare that states that harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. So the invasion of Afghanistan was\u201cright\u201dand\u201cjust,\u201dthough ill-conceived and too costly.To us. Was it a failure? For U.S.imperial goals? In some cases, yes. Reagan was the last supporter of the Apartheid regime in South Africa, but was unable to sustain it. In general, though, it extended Washington\u2019s imperial reach. Bush\u2019s renewal of the global war on terror has not had similar success. When the U.S. invaded Afghanistan, the base for radical Islamic fundamentalist terrorism was largely confined to a corner of Afghanistan. Now it is all over the world. The devastation of much of Central Asia and the Middle East has not enhanced U.S. power. I doubt that it has much impact on U.S. global supremacy, which remains overwhelming. In the military dimension, the U.S. stands alone. Its military spending eclipses rivals \u2014 in 2020, $778 billion as compared to China\u2019s $252 billion and Russia\u2019s $62 billion. The U.S. military is also far more advanced technologically. U.S. security is unrivaled. The alleged threats are at the borders of enemies, which are ringed with nuclear-armed missiles in some of the 800 U.S. military bases around the world (China has one: Djibouti). Power also has economic dimensions. At the peak of U.S. power after World War II, the U.S. had perhaps 40 percent of global wealth, a preponderance that inevitably declined. But as political economist Sean Starrs has observed, in the world of neoliberal globalization, national accounts are not the only measure of economic power. His research shows that U.S.-based multinationals control a staggering 50 percent of global wealth and are first (sometimes second) in just about every sector. Another dimension is \u201csoft power.\u201d Here,America has seriously declined, well before Trump\u2019s harsh blows to the country\u2019s reputation. Even under Clinton, leading political scientists recognized that most of the world regarded America as the world\u2019s \u201cprime rogue state\u201d and \u201cthe single greatest external threat to their societies\u201d (to quote Samuel Huntington and Robert Jervis, respectively). In the Obama years, international polls found that the U.S. was considered the greatest threat to world peace, with no contender even close. U.S. leaders can continue to undermine the country, if they choose, but its enormous power and unrivaled advantages make that a hard task, even for the Trump wrecking ball."

That fate is reserved to those who expose state crimes, not the perpetrators, who are respected, like the goofy grandpa, George W. Bush. There has of course been a serious assault on civil liberties and human rights, in some cases utterly unspeakable, like Guant\u00e1namo, where tortured prisoners still languish after many years without charges or because the torture was so hideous that judges refuse to allow them to be brought to trial.

    "output": "Indeed. The two have very different styles, although both are exceptional communicators. I say that Pepe is a village poet philosopher because he has the ability to say the deepest question with the simplest words and an incredible poetic touch. He has that ability. Noam, on the other hand, is a character who... for example, if you read material from him about linguistics, it\u2019s something tremendously complex, but the whole political issue, when he approaches his political, social, historical reflections, he does it in a very simple, very didactic way. After all, he is a teacher who has given more than sixty years of classes. So he is very didactic, very organic, very dynamic, his answers tend to be long, very concrete and with many examples. So they have very different styles. Unlike Pepe, Noam is much more intellectual than that colloquial poetics that Pepe uses. In fact, Noam is a person who all his life has been very hermetic about his personal issues. He doesn\u2019t allow you to move much from your intellectual field to your personal field. However, the meeting we managed to have at Pepe\u2019s house, where both their wives were and ate together, a much more intimate situation than a cold interview, also allowed us to see a facet of Noam where he talks about his personal life that we had never seen before. And we also see a facet of a Noam with a great sense of humor, a facet of Noam very much in love with his wife, Valeria. There are certain elements of the relationship he has with his wife and of his own sense of humour that I didn\u2019t know about Noam, that were a surprise to me and that will undoubtedly be a surprise to everyone who watches this film."

Among all the themes you mention, there is one particular that is one of Pepe\u2019s strongest themes and for me it is central to this film. Pepe talks about having a life with meaning. He says that, unlike a lettuce, a cucumber, an apple, a tree or a cow, human beings can, relatively speaking, give direction to their lives, decide why to live and how to live. Pepe talks a lot about giving meaning to your own life, which you control. Because if you don\u2019t, it will be controlled by the market or it will be controlled by social circumstances, which in the end are there to keep us in a pen locked up and depriving us of our freedom, consciously or unconsciously; consumerism, in fact, is an unconscious way of depriving us of freedom. Pepe says a lot that we must reflect and be able to find ourselves and give meaning to our life: decide what we want to make of it because otherwise it is the market that will decide for us."

    "input": "How did we get to such a state of affairs, with tremendous economic inequalities and the resurgence of the irrational in political affairs on the one hand, and an uncanny capacity, on the other, to look away from the existential crises such as global warming and nuclear weapons which will surely destroy civilized life as we know it if we continue with \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d?",
    "output": "How indeed. The question of how we got to this state of affairs is truly vast in scope, requiring not just inquiry into the origin and nature of social and cultural institutions but also into depths of human psychology that are barely understood. We can, however, take a much more modest stab at the questions, asking about certain highly consequential decisions that could have been made differently, and about specific cases where we can identify some of the roots of looking away. The history of nuclear weapons provides some striking cases. One critical decision was in 1944, when Germany was out of the war and it was clear that the only target was Japan. One cannot really say that a decision was made to proceed nevertheless to create devices that could devastate Japan even more thoroughly, and in the longer term threaten to destroy us as well. It seems that the question never seriously arose, apart from such isolated figures as Joseph Rotblat \u2014 who was later barred reentry to the U.S. Another critical decision that was not made was in the early 1950s. At the time, there were still no long-range delivery systems for nuclear weapons (ICBMs). It might have been possible to reach an agreement with Russia to bar their development. That was a plausible surmise at the time, and release of Russian archives makes it seem an even more likely prospect. Remarkably, there is no trace of any consideration of pursuing steps to bar the only weapons systems that would pose a lethal threat to the U.S., so we learn from McGeorge Bundy\u2019s standard work on the history of nuclear weapons, with access to the highest-level sources. Perhaps still more remarkably, there has, to my knowledge, been no voiced interest in this astonishing fact. It is easy to go on. The result is 75 years of living under the threat of virtually total destruction, particularly since the successful development of thermonuclear weapons by 1953 \u2014 in this case a decision, rather than lack of one. And as the record shows all too graphically, it is a virtual miracle that we have survived the nuclear age thus far. That raises your question of why we look away. I do not understand it, and never have. The question has been on my mind almost constantly since that grim day in August 1945 when we heard the news that an atom bomb had wiped out Hiroshima, with hideous casualties. Apart from the terrible tragedy itself, it was at once clear that human intelligence had devised the means to destroy us all \u2014 not quite yet, but there could be little doubt that once the genie was out of the bottle, technological developments would carry the threat to the end. I was then a junior counselor in a summer camp. The news was broadcast in the morning. Everyone listened \u2014 and then went off to the planned activity \u2014 a baseball game, swimming, whatever was scheduled. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was so shocked I just took off into the woods and sat by myself for several hours. I still can\u2019t believe it, or understand how that has persisted even as more has been learned about the threats. The same sentiments have been voiced by others, recently by William Perry [former defense secretary], who has ample experience on the inside. He reports that he is doubly terrified: by the growing risk of terrible catastrophe, and the failure to be terrified by it. It was not known in 1945, but the world was then entering into a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, in which human activity is having a severe impact on the environment that sustains life. Warnings about the potential threat of global warming date back to a 1958 paper by Hans Suess and Roger Revelle, and by the 1970s, concerns were deeply troubling to climate scientists. ExxonMobil scientists were in the forefront of spelling out the severe dangers. That is the background for a crucial decision by ExxonMobil management in 1989, after (and perhaps because) James Hansen had brought the grave threat to public attention. In 1989, management decided to lead the denialist campaign. That continues to the present. ExxonMobil now proudly declares that it intends to extract and sell all of the 25 billion barrels in its current reserves, while continuing to seek new sources. Executives are surely aware that this is virtually a death-knell for organized human society in any form that we know, but evidently it doesn\u2019t matter. Looking away with a vengeance. The suicidal impulses of the fossil fuel industry have been strongly supported by Republican administrations, by now, under Trump, leaving the U.S. in splendid isolation internationally in not only refusing to participate in international efforts to address this existential threat but in devoting major efforts to accelerate the race to disaster. It is hard to find proper words to describe what is happening \u2014 and the limited attention it receives. This again raises your question of how we can look away. For ExxonMobil, the explanation is simple enough: The logic of the capitalist market rules \u2014 what Joseph Stiglitz 25 years ago called the \u201creligion\u201d that markets know best. The same reasoning extends beyond, for example to the major banks that are pouring funds into fossil fuel extraction, including the most dangerous, like Canadian tar sands, surely in full awareness of the consequences. CEOs face a choice: They can seek to maximize profit and market share, and (consciously) labor to undermine the prospects for life on earth; or they can refuse to do so, and be removed and replaced by someone who will. The problems are not just individual; they are institutional, hence much deeper and harder to overcome. Something similar holds for media. In the best newspapers there are regular articles by the finest journalists applauding the fracking revolution and the opening of new areas for exploitation, driving the U.S. well ahead of Saudi Arabia in the race to destroy human civilization. Sometimes there are a few words about environmental effects: fracking in Wyoming may harm the water supplies for ranchers. But scarcely if ever is there a word on the effect on the planet \u2014 which is, surely, well understood by authors and editors. In this case, I suppose the explanation is professionalism. The ethics of the profession requires \u201cobjectivity\u201d: reporting accurately what is going on \u201cwithin the beltway\u201d and in executive suites, and keeping to the assigned story. To add a word about the lethal broader impact would be \u201cbias,\u201d reserved for the opinion pages. There are countless illustrations, but I think something deeper may be involved, something related to the \u201creligion\u201d that Stiglitz criticized. Worship of markets has many effects. One we see in the origins of the reigning neoliberal faiths. Their origin is in post-World War I Vienna, after the collapse of the trading system within the Hapsburg empire. Ludwig von Mises and his associates fashioned the basic doctrines that were quickly labeled \u201cneoliberalism,\u201d based on the principle of \u201csound economics\u201d: markets know best, no interference with them is tolerable. There are immediate consequences. One is that labor unions, which interfere with flexibility of labor markets, must be destroyed, along with social democratic measures. Mises openly welcomed the crushing of the vibrant Austrian unions and social democracy by state violence in 1928, laying the groundwork for Austrian fascism. Which Mises welcomed as well. He became economic consultant to the proto-fascist Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, and in his major workLiberalism, explained that \u201cIt cannot be denied that Fascism and similar movements aiming at the establishment of dictatorships are full of the best intentions and that their intervention has, for the moment, saved European civilization. The merit that Fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history.\u201d These themes resonate through the modern neoliberal era. The U.S. has an unusually violent labor history, but the attack on unions gained new force under Reagan with the onset of the neoliberal era. As the business press reported, employers were effectively informed that labor laws would not be enforced, and the U.S. became the only industrial society apart from Apartheid South Africa to tolerate not just scabs, but even \u201cpermanent replacement workers.\u201d Neoliberal globalization, precarity of employment, and other devices carry the process of destroying organized labor further. These developments form a core part of the efforts to realize the Thatcherite dictum that \u201cthere is no society,\u201d only atomized individuals, who face the forces of \u201csound economics\u201d alone \u2014 becoming what Marx called \u201ca sack of potatoes\u201d in his condemnation of the policies of the authoritarian rulers of mid-19th century Europe. sack of potatoes cannot react in any sensible way even to existential crises. Lacking the very bases of deliberative democracy, such as functioning labor unions and other organizations, people have little choice beyond \u201clooking away.\u201d What can they hope to do? As Mises memorably explained, echoed by Milton Friedman and others, political democracy is superfluous \u2014 indeed an impediment to sound economics: \u201cfree competition does all that is needed\u201d in markets that function without interference. The pathology is not new, but can become more severe under supportive social and economic institutions and practices."

The basis for the contemporary high-tech economy was established in the last decades of the special century, mainly through public investment, adapted to the market in the years that followed. There is currently rapid innovation in frills \u2014 new apps for iPhones, etc. \u2014 but nothing like the fundamental achievements of the special century. And in the U.S., there has been stagnation or decline in real wages for non-supervisory workers and in recent years, increased death rates among working-class, working-age whites, called \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d by the economists who have documented these startling facts, Anne Case and Angus Deaton. There is more to say about other societies. There are numerous complexities of major significance that disappear in unanalyzed statistical tables."

    "input": "Realism, crystallized intellectually by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli inThe Prince,has been the guiding principle of nation-states behind their conduct of international relations from the beginning of the modem era, while idealism and morality have been seen as values best left to individuals. Is political realism driving us to the edge of the cliff? And, if so, what should replace the behavioral stance of governments in the 21st century?",
    "output": "The two major doctrines of International Relations Theory are Realism and Idealism. Each has their advocates, but it\u2019s true that the Realists have dominated: the world\u2019s a tough place, an anarchic system, and states maneuver to establish power and security, making coalitions, offshore balancing, etc. I think we can put aside Idealism \u2014 though it has its advocates, including, curiously, one of the founders and leading figures of the modern tough-minded Realist school, Hans Morgenthau. In his 1960 work,The Purpose of American Politics, Morgenthau argued that the U.S., unlike other societies, has a \u201ctranscendent purpose\u201d: establishing peace and freedom at home and indeed everywhere. A serious scholar, Morgenthau recognized that the historical record is radically inconsistent with the \u201ctranscendent purpose\u201d of America, but he advised that we should not be misled by the apparent inconsistency. In his words, we should not \u201cconfound the abuse of reality with reality itself.\u201d Reality is the unachieved \u201cnational purpose\u201d revealed by \u201cthe evidence of history as our minds reflect it.\u201d What actually happened is merely the \u201cabuse of reality.\u201d To confound abuse of reality with reality is akin to \u201cthe error of atheism, which denies the validity of religion on similar grounds.\u201d For the most part, however, realists adhere to Realism, without sentimentality. We might ask, however, how realistic Realism is. With a few exceptions \u2014 Kenneth Waltz for one \u2014 realists tend to ignore the roots of policy in the structure of domestic power, in which, of course, the corporate system is overwhelmingly dominant. This is not the place to review the matter, but I think it can be shown that much is lost by this stance. That\u2019s true even of the core notion of Realism: security. True, states seek security, but for whom? For the general population? For the systems of power represented by the architects of policy? Such questions cannot be casually put aside. The two existential crises we have discussed are a case in point. Does the government policy of maximization of the use of fossil fuels contribute to the security of the population? Or of ExxonMobil and its brethren. Does the current military posture of the U.S. \u2014 dismantling theINF Treatyinstead of negotiating disputes over violations, rushing ahead with hypersonic weapons instead of seeking to bar these insane weapons systems by treaty, and much else \u2014 contribute to the security of the population? Or to the component of the corporate manufacturing system in which the U.S. enjoys comparative advantage: destruction. Similar questions arise constantly. What should replace the prevailing stance is government of, by and for the people, highlighting their concerns and needs."

Today, however, it is globalization that is being challenged, first and foremost by the resurgence of nationalism. Is there a case to be made in defense of globalization? And, by extension, is all nationalism bad and dangerous?",
    "output": "Globalization is neither good nor bad in itself. It depends how it is implemented. Enhancing opportunities for ideas, innovations, aesthetic contributions to disseminate freely is a welcome form of globalization, as well as opportunities for people to circulate freely. The WTO system, designed to set working people in competition with one another while protecting investor rights with an exorbitant patent regime and other devices, is a form of globalization that has many harmful consequences that would be avoided in authentic trade agreements designed along different lines \u2014 and it should be borne in mind that much of the substance of the \u201cfree trade agreements\u201d is not about free trade or even trade in any meaningful sense. Same with nationalism. In the hands of the Nazis, it was extremely dangerous. If it is a form of bonding and mutual support within some community it can be a valuable part of human life. The current resurgence of nationalism is in large part a reaction to the harsh consequences of neoliberal globalization, with special features such as the erosion of democracy in Europe by transfer of decision-making to the unelected Troika with the northern banks looking over their shoulders. And it can and does take quite ugly forms \u2014 the worst, perhaps, the reaction to the so-called \u201crefugee crisis\u201d \u2014 more accurately termed a moral crisis of the West, as Pope Francis has indicated.

    "input": "In your critiques of U.S. foreign policy, you often refer to the United States as the world\u2019s biggest terrorist state. Is there something unique about the United States as an imperial state? And is U.S. imperialism still alive and kicking?",
    "output": "The U.S. is unique in many respects. That includes the opening words of the Declaration of Independence, \u201cWe the People,\u201d a revolutionary idea, however flawed in execution. It is also a rare country that has been at war almost without a break from its first moment. One of the motives for the American Revolution was to eliminate the barrier to expansion into \u201cIndian country\u201d imposed by the British. With that overcome, the new nation set forth on wars against the Indian nations that inhabited what became the national territory; wars of \u201cextermination,\u201d as the most prominent figures recognized, notably John Quincy Adams, the architect of Manifest Destiny. Meanwhile half of Mexico was conquered in what General U.S. Grant, later president, called one of the most \u201cwicked wars\u201d in history. There is no need to review record of interventions, subversion and violence, particularly since World War II, which established the U.S. in a position of global dominance with no historical precedent. The record includes the worst crime of the postwar period, the assault on Indochina, and the worst crime of this millennium, the invasion of Iraq. Like most terms of political discourse, \u201cimperialism\u201d is a contested notion. Whatever term we want to use, the U.S. is alone in having hundreds of military bases and troops operating over much of the world. It is also unique in its willingness and ability to impose brutal sanctions designed to punish the people of states designated as enemies. And its market power and dominance of the international financial system provide these sanctions with extraterritorial reach, compelling even powerful states to join in, however unwillingly. The most dramatic case is Cuba, where U.S. sanctions are strongly opposed by the entire world, to no avail. The vote against these sanctions was 189-2, U.S. and Israel, in the latest UNGA [United Nations General Assembly] condemnation. The sanctions have been in place for almost 60 years, harshly punishing Cubans for what the State Department called \u201csuccessful defiance\u201d of the U.S. Trump\u2019s sanctions on Venezuela have turned a humanitarian crisis into a catastrophe, according to the leading economist of the opposition, Francisco Rodriguez. His sanctions on Iran are quite explicitly designed to destroy the economy and punish the population. This is no innovation. Clinton\u2019s sanctions on Iraq (joined by Blair) were so destructive that each of the distinguished international diplomats who administered the \u201coil for food\u201d program resigned in protest, charging that the sanctions were \u201cgenocidal.\u201d The second, Hans-Christof von Sponeck, published a detailed and incisive book about the impact of the sanctions (A Different Kind of War). It has been under a virtual ban. Too revealing, perhaps. The brutal sanctions punished the population and devastated the society, but strengthened the tyrant, compelling people to rely on his rationing system for survival, possibly saving him from overthrow from within, as happened to a string of similar figures. That\u2019s quite standard. The same is reportedly true in Iran today. It could be argued that the sanctions violate the Geneva Conventions, which condemn \u201ccollective punishment\u201d as a war crime, but legalistic shenanigans can get around that. The U.S. no longer has the capacity it once did to overthrow governments at will or to invade other countries, but it has ample means of coercion and domination, call it \u201cimperialism\u201d or not."

    "output": "The U.S. almost never ratifies international conventions, and in the few cases where it does, it is with reservations that exclude the U.S. That\u2019s even true of the Genocide Convention, which the U.S. finally did ratify after many years, exempting itself. The issue arose in 1999, when Yugoslavia brought a charge of war crimes to the ICJ [International Court of Justice] against NATO. One of the charges was \u201cgenocide.\u201d The U.S. therefore rejected World Court jurisdiction on the grounds that it was not subject to the Genocide Convention, and the Court agreed \u2014 agreeing, in effect, that the U.S. is entitled to carry out genocide with impunity. It might be noted that the U.S. is currently alone (along with China and Taiwan) in rejecting a World Court decision, namely, the 1986 Court judgment ordering the U.S. to terminate its \u201cunlawful use of force\u201d against Nicaragua and to pay substantial reparations. Washington\u2019s rejection of the Court decision was applauded by the liberal media on the grounds that the Court was a \u201chostile forum\u201d (New York Times), so its decisions don\u2019t matter. A few years earlier the Court had been a stern arbiter of Justice when it ruled in favor of the U.S. in a case against Iran. The U.S. also has laws authorizing the executive to use force to \u201crescue\u201d any American brought to the Hague \u2014 sometimes called in Europe \u201cthe Hague Invasion Act.\u201d Recently it revoked the visa of the Chief Prosecutor of the ICC [International Criminal Court] for daring to consider inquiring into U.S. actions in Afghanistan. It goes on. Why? It\u2019s called \u201cpower,\u201d and a population that tolerates it \u2014 and for the most part probably doesn\u2019t even know about it."

In that context, does the power to hold leaders responsible for unjust wars, crimes against humanity, and crimes of aggression hold promise in the international order of today?",
    "output": "That depends on whether states will accept jurisdiction. Sometimes they do. The NATO powers (except for the U.S.) accepted ICJ jurisdiction in the Yugoslavia case, for example \u2014 presumably because they took for granted that the Court would never accept the Yugoslavian pleas, even when they were valid, as in the case of the targeted destruction of a TV station, killing 16 journalists. In the more free and democratic states, populations could, in principle, decide that their governments should obey international law, but that is a matter of raising the level of civilization. John Bolton and other ultranationalists, and many others, argue that the U.S. must not abandon its sovereignty to international institutions and international law. They are therefore arguing that U.S. leaders should violate the Constitution, which declares that valid treaties are the supreme law of the land. That includes in particular the UN Charter, the foundation of modern international law, established under U.S. auspices."

These agreements are, to a large extent, also arms deals. What should we make of these agreements and their affects on the prospects for a just solution for the Palestinian people?",
    "output": "The Palestinians have been completely thrown under the bus. There is nothing in this for them. These agreements are actually raising to the surface tacit interactions and arrangements which already existed and have existed for a long time. Israel and Saudi Arabia are technically at war, but they have in fact been allies ever since 1967. The \u201867 war was a great gift to Saudi Arabia and the United States, for very simple reasons: there was a conflict in the Arab world between radical Islam, based in Saudi Arabia, and secular nationalism, based in Egypt. The United States supported radical Islam, just as the British had when they were the dominant power. Neither of the imperial powers want[ed] secular nationalism, that\u2019s dangerous; [but] radical Islam they can live with and control. Saudi Arabia and Egypt were at war in the 1960s. Israel\u2019s great victory smashed secular nationalism, and left radical Islam in power. That\u2019s when U.S. relations with Israel changed substantially to their modern form. After \u201867, Israel just became a base for American power in the region, and shifted far to the right. Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Iran \u2014 which was then under the Shah \u2014 were considered the three pillars on which U.S. policy in the region rested. Technically, all three of them were in conflict, but in fact they had very close relations; this came to the surface after the Shah fell. It turned out that the Labor leaders [Israel\u2019s dominant political party until 1977] and others had been traveling to Iran and had very close relations with them. Now that\u2019s brought to the surface, what does it mean? The Trump administration had a geo-strategic plan to construct a \u201creactionary international\u201d: the world\u2019s most reactionary, harsh states, controlled by the White House, as the base for U.S. global power. In the Middle East, this base is the family dictatorships of the Gulf, especially [Saudi Arabian Crown Prince] MBS [Mohammed bin Salman]; [Abdel Fattah] Al-Sisi\u2019s Egypt, the harshest dictatorship in Egypt\u2019s history; and Israel, which has moved so far to the right that you need a telescope to find it. With Biden in office, this [alliance] will probably reduce to some extent, depending on the level of activism. What\u2019s happened in the United States in the past 10-15 years is quite important. If you go back, say, 20 years, Israel used to be the darling of the liberal, educated sectors. That\u2019s changed. Now the support for Israel has shifted to the far right \u2014 Evangelical Christians, ultra-nationalists, and militarists. The far right of the Republican party is [now] the main base of support for Israel. [Today], a lot of liberal Democrats support Palestinian rights more than Israel, especially younger people, which includes young Jews, who are either dropping out or moving toward support for the Palestinians. So far, this has had no effect on U.S. policy. But if activist groups could move to a genuine solidarity movement in the United States with Palestinians, as has been done for other Third World nationalist groups, it could have an effect. One thing that\u2019s critical is relations with Iran. As you know, Elliott Abrahams [Trump\u2019s special representative for Iran] has been to Israel trying to strengthen the anti-Iranian, Saudi-Israeli-Emirates coalition. They\u2019ve announced new, harsh sanctions against Iran. That\u2019s virtually an act of war, amounting to a blockade. For example, Iran has just ordered millions of flu vaccines, which is very critical now if there is a double hit of flu and coronavirus, [but] the U.S. blocked it. The basis [for this policy] is supposed to be Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons... Suppose we agree that Iranian nuclear weapons are a problem. Actually, they aren\u2019t: the only problem with Iran developing nuclear weapons would be that it would be a deterrent to the two rogue states \u2014 the United States and Israel \u2014 which want to rampage freely in the region. But let\u2019s pretend they\u2019re a problem. The solution is very simple: institute a nuclear weapons-free zone in the region, with intensive inspections. Israel claims that they don\u2019t work, but... even U.S. intelligence agrees that the inspections under the joint agreement worked very well. Is there a barrier to that [idea]? Well, yes. It\u2019s not the Arab states \u2014 they\u2019ve been calling for it for 30 years. It\u2019s not Iran, which openly supports it. It\u2019s not the Global South, the G-77, or about 130 countries, who are strongly in favor of it. [Even] Europe\u2019s in favor of it. Why does it stop? Because every time it comes up in an international meeting, the United States vetoes it. The last [president] to do it was [Barack] Obama in 2015. Why? It doesn\u2019t want Israeli nuclear weapons to be inspected. In fact, the United States, does not even officially recognize that Israel has nuclear weapons, because if [it did so], U.S. law would come into operation: U.S. law bans economic and military aid to countries which have been developing nuclear weapons outside the framework of the international arms control regime, as Israel has. Neither Democrats nor Republicans want to open that door. But if there was a solidarity movement in the United States, it could open the door. If Americans knew that we are facing a potential war in order to protect Israeli nuclear weapons, they would be infuriated. That\u2019s the job of a solidarity movement, if it existed. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t, but that\u2019s a real possibility. On that note, you mentioned both the extreme and unprecedented move of Israel to the right, as well as the possibility of a solidarity movement inside the United States, incorporating not only exiled Palestinians but also American Jews, who are predominantly liberal, and who have been \u2014 for decades now \u2014 falling out of love with Israel. You\u2019ve also mentioned in your writing the utter dependence of Israel on U.S. support, as exemplified by the [F-16 fighter jet] Falcons deal affair."

    "input": "Given these three facts, is Israeli society a lost cause? Should Israeli activists give up trying to change other Israelis\u2019 minds and turn to international pressure against Israel?",
    "output": "I think the first thing they should do is pay attention to what has happened. In the mid-1970s, Israel [under the Labor government] made a fateful decision: they had a very clear choice between peace and integration in the region, or expansion. There were strong opportunities for a political settlement: Egypt was pushing for it very hard, [and] Syria and Jordan joined. The PLO was mixed; in the background they were calling for it, but they wouldn\u2019t say it publicly. This came to a head several times. One of the most important times \u2014 which is almost written out of history \u2014 was in January 1976. The UN Security Council debated a resolution calling for a two-state settlement on the Green Line \u2014 the internationally recognized border \u2014 and here I\u2019m quoting: \u201cwith guarantees for the right of each state to exist in peace and security, within secure and recognized borders.\u201d Israel was furious. They refused to attend the session. Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, denounced the proposal, and said he will never discuss anything with any Palestinians, [that] there will never be any Palestinian state. Chaim Herzog, the UN representative, later claimed \u2014 falsely, of course \u2014 that the resolution was initiated by the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] in an attempt to destroy Israel. These are the \u201cdoves.\u201d They went berserk. They wanted nothing to do with it. The U.S. vetoed the resolution. [And] when the U.S. vetoes a resolution, it\u2019s a double veto: the resolution is blocked, and it\u2019s vetoed from history. That happens over and over. There were other opportunities of the same kind, and what was at stake for the Labor party (Mapai) was primarily expansion into the Sinai. They were following the Galilee protocols, building the all-Jewish city of Yamit, destroying Bedouin villages and towns, setting up kibbutzim and other settlements in the Sinai. [Egyptian President Anwar] Sadat made it very clear that [building] Yamit means war. That\u2019s the background for the 1973 [Yom Kippur] war. But Israel continued. The Israeli government \u2014 the so-called \u201cleft\u201d at the time \u2014 preferred expansion over security. And that was a fateful decision: once they made it, they became completely dependent on the United States. It was clear in the \u201870s that this is going to turn Israel into a pariah state. Sooner or later, world opinion would turn against the policy of expansion, violence, aggression, and terror in the occupied territories. And over the years, that has happened... It was all inevitable. And then comes what you were just discussing. Every time the United States puts its foot down and says, \u201cYou have to do this,\u201d Israel does it, no matter how opposed they are. Every single U.S. president \u2014 Reagan, the first Bush, Clinton, second Bush \u2014 all imposed sharp constraints on Israel. Israel didn\u2019t like it, but had to live up to it. The first U.S. president who never made any demands on Israel was Obama: he was the most pro-Israel president in history [until Trump]. [Yet] for Israel, he wasn\u2019t supportive enough. In fact, what Obama did is pretty remarkable. Usually, U.S. vetoes never get reported, [but] one was: in February 2011, Obama vetoed a Security Council resolution calling for the implementation of official U.S. policy, demanding an end to expansion of settlements. The [real] issue is not expansion, it\u2019s the settlements; [but] even on that small point, Obama vetoed. The Trump administration is even more extreme; it just comes out of [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu\u2019s pocket. Biden will probably go back to [the policies of] Obama. He could go further [to the left] if the activist movements get organized, pressing on the nuclear weapons issue, [which] could reduce and in fact end the threatening prospects of a war in the Middle East. But there\u2019s more. The Leahy Law [nicknamed after Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy] bars U.S. military aid to units anywhere that are engaged in systematic human right abuses. Nobody wants to open that door; but an activist movement could do it. Even the threat or discussion of eliminating economic and military aid would have a significant influence \u2014 especially since Israel made the decision, years ago, to be completely subordinated to the United States. I\u2019d like to make one more point about the standard discussion on the Middle East. With Israel-Palestine, we\u2019re [usually] presented with two options. One is the longstanding international consensus on a two-state settlement; the other option is one state, in which Israel takes over the West Bank, then maybe there would be an anti-apartheid struggle for the Palestinians. But those are not the two options \u2014 the one state is not an option [because] Israel is never going to agree to become a majority-Palestinian state with a Jewish minority. The second option, apart from two states, is the one we\u2019ve seen developing before our eyes for 50 years: Greater Israel. Israel takes over whatever it wants in the occupied territories, but not the population centers; Israel doesn\u2019t want Nablus or Tulkarem. Divide the other areas into almost two hundred enclaves surrounded by soldiers, checkpoints, various ways to make life miserable. When nobody\u2019s looking, destroy another village \u2014 as just happened in the Jordan Valley under the cover of the U.S. elections \u2014 step by step, dunam after dunam, so that thegoyimdon\u2019t notice, or pretend not to notice. Then put up a watchtower, then a fence, then a couple of goats, and pretty soon you have a settlement. That\u2019s the history of Zionism. Now, Israel has got [Greater Israel] pretty much in place... That\u2019s the second option, and that\u2019s what we should be talking about. This Greater Israel project will solve the famous \u201cdemographic problem\u201d \u2014 too many non-Jews in a Jewish state. The areas that are being integrated into Israel will not have many Palestinians, [but] they\u2019ll have plenty of settlers. And as that project gets established and formalized, it will be a large majority Jewish state. That\u2019s what\u2019s being developed before our eyes, visibly, and that\u2019s what we ought to be talking about, not the illusion of one state. I think it might be a great idea, but it\u2019s not a choice. To end perhaps on a lighter note: last year marked the 20th anniversary of the withdrawal of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. As you write in your book \u201cA New Generation Draws the Line,\u201d the end of Suharto\u2019s occupation of East Timor came first as a result of a new wave of massacres against civilians, and then with President Bill Clinton basically announcing to Suharto that he has to end the U.S.-supported occupation."

    "output": "That\u2019s a very interesting analogy. East Timor was the closest to true genocide after the Second World War \u2014 horrible atrocities, wiped out a large part of the population, outright Indonesian aggression. The U.S. strongly supported it all the way from the beginning to the end, as late as September 1999. A couple of weeks later, Clinton quietly ordered the Indonesian military to withdraw. They instantly withdrew. That\u2019s what\u2019s called power. The international system \u2014 scholars like to write nice words about it \u2014 but it\u2019s basically the mafia: the Godfather tells you what to do, and you do it, or else. We\u2019ve just seen that dramatically at the Security Council a couple of weeks ago [late 2020]. The United States wanted the Security Council to re-institute its sanctions against Iran. The Security Council refused; not a single U.S. ally agreed. So what happened? Secretary of State Mike Pompeo went to the Council and told them \u201cSorry, you\u2019re re-instituting the sanctions.\u201d And they did so. That\u2019s the way the world works. The Indonesia-Timor case was very striking. It was a long struggle, 25 years of hard work, [especially] in Australia and the United States. Nobody had ever even heard of East Timor \u2014 the press wouldn\u2019t cover it, or lied about it, and so on. Finally, it broke through. Then Clinton, with just a word, quietly told the Indonesian military, \u201cThe game is over, go on.\u201d I don\u2019t think it would be exactly like that in Israel, but something like it is entirely possible. You\u2019ve seen elements of it, [such as] George W. Bush saying to top Israeli military officials, \u201cYou are not even allowed to visit here [the United States] until you do what we say, and you\u2019ve got to apologize,\u201d and of course they did it... As soon as the United States told them \u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d they backed down. Those are relations of power. So it could happen. Not exactly in this way, but something similar. Again, I think that what is seriously moving is a joint U.S.-Israeli solidarity movement working for these ends. That could make a difference."

    "input": "Hassan Mirza (HM): Did religion have any big influence on you when you were growing up? Were your family members religious?Noam Chomsky (NC): Judaism did, religion didn\u2019t. My parents were not religious in the usual sense. Deeply rooted in Jewish/Hebraic culture, somewhat observant.HM: What do you think about the event of death? And do you believe in an afterlife?NC: As a young teenager, I used to worry about the end of personal consciousness, but after that became more engaged with living my life, and still do. I know of no reason to believe in an afterlife or divine justice.HM: My reading tells me that \u2018Religion\u2019 means different things, concepts, ideas to different people. And it can be a useful heuristic and community building tool.NC: Quite agree. I\u2019ve been saying much the same things for years, though often with different examples.HM: In my opinion, the heuristic nature of religion, and the basic interdicts of the Abrahamic religions make much more sense and help people survive more so than the thick books of Stephan Pinker, Richard Dawkins, Joseph Stitglitz and other popular figures of the western world. Does everyone in the world have to read this much and develop this much understanding in order to survive and thrive? And shouldn\u2019t there be limits on the \u2018Why\u2019 (understanding) and more focus on the \u2018How\u2019 (survival, doing things, belief)?NC: If people can select from the wide range of beliefs found in the major religions in ways that improve their lives, there\u2019s no reason to object, as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with others. But there\u2019s no conflict with science in that stance, or shouldn\u2019t be.HM: In the last few years the militant \u2018New Atheism\u2019 movement has gained popularity in the western world. Are these people guilty of \u2018scientism\u2019?NC: I\u2019ve criticised the \u201cNew Atheism,\u201d but on different grounds. I don\u2019t think the problem is \u2018scientism\u2019. Any teenager can easily find material in the holy texts that appears to be refuted by science. In fact, these topics are discussed in depth in medieval philosophy, in all the Abrahamic religions, all ignored by the New Atheists. But their deepest error I think is to dismiss with ridicule beliefs that are extremely important to people\u2019s lives, and should be respected, whatever we think of their empirical validity. If a mother hopes to see her dying child in heaven, it is not my task to give her lessons in epistemology.HM: One of them, the late Christopher Hitchens, became a supporter of the Iraq-Afghan wars after 9/11. I read your articles and his rejoinder inThe Nation, also watched a talk of his in which he said that you thought America was not a good idea and the country was all about genocides and imperialism, or something to that effect. What went wrong with him?NC: Around the time of the Balkan wars in the early \u201890s, Hitchens seems to have lost his mind and began writing quite crazy stuff, like what you quote. I never knew him well enough to know why, and scarcely paid attention to him after his strange conversion.HM: Many experts of social sciences, the \u2018New Atheists\u2019 and celebrity atheists like Lawrence Krauss keep claiming that religion, or even belief, is irrelevant as we can now know everything through inquiry and can explain and model everything when it comes to human affairs and biases. Many times research in social sciences (like anthropology) is not reproducible and yet it is claimed to be scientific. Maybe the French post-modernism is an example of it?NC: I agree with you about Paris post-modernism, mostly a cult I think. About anthropology, there\u2019s good work that one can make use of, and lots of what you describe. I don\u2019t think the \u201cNew Atheists\u201d are representative of science generally, and Krauss in particular can be open-minded.HM: People like Dawkins and Sam Harris keep disparaging religion and the idea of God but at the same time have written books about practicing spirituality via science. Does this make any sense?NC: They can\u2019t even come close. Dawkins I think is serious. Harris I have no time for.HM: Why can\u2019t religion complement philosophy in contemporary western thought?NC: For many people they do, insofar as religious doctrines don\u2019t infringe upon empirical inquiry into the world.HM: Is the world moving towards or away from religion?NC: There is a revival of religion in some circles, but also an increase of those who self-identify as non-believers.",

    "output": "Of course, it\u2019s the same country. We haven\u2019t undergone a major revolution, but the last four years are very much out of line with the history of Western democracies altogether. By now, it\u2019s becoming almost outlandish. In the three hundred and fifty years of parliamentary democracy, there\u2019s been nothing like what we\u2019re seeing now in Washington. I don\u2019t have to tell you. You read the same newspapers I do. A President who has said if he doesn\u2019t like the outcome of an election, he\u2019ll simply not leave office, and is taken seriously enough that, for example, two high-level, highly respected, retired military officers\u2014one of them very well known, Lieutenant Colonel John Nagl\u2014actually went to the extent of writing an open letter to General [Mark] Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,reminding himof his constitutional duties to send in the American military to remove the President from office if he refuses to leave. There\u2019s along article, which you\u2019ve probably seen, by Barton Gellman, reviewing the strategies that Republican leadership is thinking of to try and undermine the election. There has been plenty of tampering before. We\u2019re not unfamiliar with that. In fact, one case that comes to mind is kind of relevant at the moment: 1960. Richard Nixon had pretty good reason to believe that he had won the election. Nixon, who was not the most delightful person in the history of Presidential politics, decided to put the welfare of the country over his personal ambition. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing now, and that\u2019s only one sign of a very significant change. The executive has been almost totally purged of any critical independent voices\u2014nothing left but sycophants. If they\u2019re not sufficiently loyal to the master, fire them and get someone else. A striking example recently was thefiring of the inspectors generalwhen they started looking into the incredible swamp Trump created in Washington. This kind of thing goes on and on."

    "output": "Well, there are some new things which are not being much discussed. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Trump, but the people around him are essentially creating an international alliance of extremely reactionary states, which can be controlled by the White House, which, of course, has shifted way far to the right, tearing up every international agreement, wrecking everything in sight. In the Western Hemisphere, a leading figure would be [Jair] Bolsonaro, in Brazil, kind of a Trump clone, and the Middle East, with Gulf dictatorships, the most reactionary states in the world, and Egypt under [Abdel Fattah El-]Sisi, probably the worst dictatorship in Egypt\u2019s history. Israel has moved very far to the right. The current so-called peace agreements have nothing to do with peace agreements. It\u2019s a very natural Middle East base for the Trump-run reactionary international. In the East, [Narendra] Modi\u2019s India is a prime candidate. He\u2019s smashing Indian secular democracy, trying to impose Hindu nationalist theocracy, crushing Kashmir. They\u2019re an obvious part of it. In Europe, the prime candidate is [Viktor] Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary. Matteo Salvini\u2019s not yet in power, but Italy\u2019s right behind. There are other pleasant figures around the world, but that\u2019s basically the core of it. Now, that\u2019s one side of throwing out all international agreements and throwing out any concern whatsoever for the attitudes and priorities of others. It was revealed with typical Trump Administration arrogance in [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo\u2019s announcement that the United Nations\u2019 sanctions are reinstituted against Iran. Why? Because he says so. The United States brought it to the Security Council and could get virtually no support. So therefore we reinstitute the United Nations\u2019 sanctions unilaterally. That\u2019s the Godfather talking. It doesn\u2019t matter what anyone else thinks. The same is true of every international agreement. The arms-control regime has been torn to shreds, with great danger to us as well as everyone else."

I\u2019m interested that you say that you think the Trump Administration is a break with the past. How do you think it\u2019s different in some way?",
    "output": "Well, having an arms-control regime is different than not having one. That\u2019s a break, and it\u2019s a break on one of the two most significant issues in human history. We\u2019ve been living for seventy-five years under the shadow of possible nuclear destruction. The arms-control regime that\u2019s been slowly built up over the years\u2014Eisenhower\u2019s Open Skies proposal, theReagan-Gorbachev I.N.F. treaty, and other pieces\u2014has mitigated the dangers. Trump has been tearing every piece of it to shreds. The only thing that\u2019s left isNew start. It has to be ratified by next February. If Trump wins the election or refuses to leave office, it will be gone by February. The other major threat to human survival in any recognizable form is environmental catastrophe, and, there, Trump is alone in the world. Most countries are doing at least something about it\u2014not as much as they should be, but some of them rather significant, some less so. The United States has pulled out of the Paris Agreement; is refusing to do any of the actions that might help poorer countries deal with the problem; is racing toward maximizing the use of fossil fuels; and, at the same time, just opened the last major nature reserve in the United States for drilling. He has to make sure that we maximize the use of fossil fuels, race to the precipice as quickly as possible, and eliminate the regulations, which not only limit the dangerous effects but also protect Americans. Step by step, eliminate everything that might protect Americans or that will preserve the possibility of overcoming the very serious threat of environmental catastrophe. There is nothing like this in history. It\u2019s not breaking with the American tradition. Can you think of anyone in human history who has dedicated his efforts to undermining the prospects for survival of organized human life on earth? In fact, some of the productions of the Trump Administration are just mind-boggling. To answer your last question, even if it was rhetorical, it seems like the Republican Party leading up to Trump had very similar views on climate-change science, even if he\u2019s taken it in a more nihilistic direction. What leading figure in human history has dedicated policy toward maximizing the use of fossil fuels and cutting down on regulations that mitigate the disaster? Name one. Bolsonaro perhaps, but yes, I get your\u2014 Bolsonaro, a Trump clone, and that\u2019s following Trump\u2019s lead. Yes, he\u2019s doing it dangerously, but even he hasn\u2019t gone as far as Trump. You\u2019ve written a lot of books about American foreign policy, and one of the themes is that American foreign policy is often driven by the economic interests of \u00e9lites. I think that there is a way in which that is still true, and obviously Trump is of the economic \u00e9lite. But, with Trump, it seems like perhaps his personal desire for money is driving American foreign policy now. I wonder if that\u2019s made you think differently about how American foreign policy is carried out. Not at all. In this respect, he\u2019s a continuation, but you have to make distinctions. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the best President we\u2019ve had, in my opinion, and was committed to maximizing American power, and the role of [American] economic interest in the world, and so on. Adolf Hitler, in the same years, was committed to that in Nazi Germany, but that doesn\u2019t lead us to conclude that they\u2019re the same thing. I thought that\u2019s what I was saying, a little bit. Trump seems to care about his own interests and his own survival, and you have talked about American foreign policy previously being driven by the interests of a whole ruling economic \u00e9lite. I guess maybe that\u2019s a distinction without a difference, because it\u2019s economic \u00e9lites who are supporting Trump and allowing him to do this, in some sense. Not only are they supporting him, but he\u2019s serving them slavishly. It\u2019s hard to find an American President who has been more dedicated to enriching and empowering the ultra-rich and the corporate sector\u2014which is, of course, why they\u2019re happy to tolerate his antics. For example, the one real legislative achievement is the tax scam, which was just a giveaway to the very rich and the corporate sector. In fact, everything I\u2019ve just mentioned is the same. When you reduce regulations, you\u2019re putting more money in the pockets of the rich and harming the working class and the poor and everyone else. That\u2019s extreme. When you refuse to fill the National Labor Relations Board with members so that employers can get away with anything they want, you\u2019re serving the rich. We can go right down the list. He\u2019s a very loyal servant of private power, private wealth, and the corporate sector\u2014which is why they let him get away with the kind of antics you see. It\u2019s kind of striking when you see the great and powerful get together. Take a look at the last Davos conference, in January. There were three keynote speakers. The first, of course, was Trump. They don\u2019t like him. They don\u2019t like him at all because they like to put forward an image of humanism, civilized behavior, decency, \u201cput your trust in us,\u201d that sort of thing. But when he spoke, they gave him rousing applause. They couldn\u2019t stand anything he was saying. There\u2019s this braggart up there ranting about how wonderful he is. They were probably cringing in their seats, but they gave him rousing applause because there\u2019s one line that he said that they understand, which is meaningful: I\u2019m going to put plenty of money in your pockets, so therefore you better tolerate me. That\u2019s the way he\u2019s regarded by the powerful \u00e9lites here. Yeah, we can\u2019t stand him, he\u2019s a disgusting creature, but he knows which side the bread is buttered: ours. What you\u2019re saying seems more similar to the mainstream center-left discourse on Trump and the unique threat he poses to American democracy than it does to some left-wing discourse on the same. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve been aware of that in your own analysis and if you think that that\u2019s interesting or funny."

    "output": "Stalin\u2019s intentions were to maintain power and control. He didn\u2019t purposely want to kill people. He had to kill people as a means toward this end. Take, say, Henry Kissinger. When he sends a directive to the American Air Force saying, about a massive bombing campaign in Cambodia, \u201canything that flies on anything that moves,\u201d does he have the intention of committing genocide? Do I care? No. I just care that that\u2019s what he said. To return to a previous point: the left has often described Trump as a symptom of American decline or American bad behavior, and said that the real threat to American democracy is all of these things that have been true about us for a long time. The center-left has often described Trump as a uniquely malignant figure, who is threatening a democracy that was working better than some people on the left thought. You were seeming to come down on the latter side of that debate\u2014which, given your status in the American left, I thought was interesting. Sorry. I think [American] democracy, first of all, was never much to write home about. Do you really want to talk about it? The Founding Fathers, let\u2019s go back to them. They were committed to reducing democracy. The major scholarly work on the Constitutional Convention, the gold standard for today, is Michael Klarman\u2019s book, and it\u2019s called \u201cThe Framers\u2019 Coup\u201d\u2014their coup against democracy. The general population wanted more democracy. The Framers wanted to restrict that; they didn\u2019t like the idea of democracy. Their picture was more or less that of John Jay: the people who own the country ought to rule it. James Madison explained that one of the prime goals of government is to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority, and the Constitution was designed to try to prevent what is called the tyranny of the majority, meaning democracy. You\u2019ve got to protect the minority; the opulent have to be protected. There are all sorts of ways in which this was done. There\u2019s been a battle about that over the centuries. But since roughly 1980, since the neoliberal regression began, there has been a significant decline in the partially functioning democracy that existed before. That\u2019s an immediate reflection of the policies that were chosen. You recall Reagan\u2019s [first] Inaugural Address: government is the problem. What does that mean? Decisions are being made somewhere. If they\u2019re not made in government, which is under at least partial influence of the population, they are being made in the private sector by unaccountable private institutions. You take a look more closely, and 0.1 per cent of the population now hold twenty per cent of the wealth of the country. It\u2019s had a major effect on the political system for perfectly obvious reasons. You have somebody elected to Congress. The first thing they have to do is get on the telephone, call the donors to make sure they\u2019re going to be funded in the next electoral campaign. That\u2019s the kind of democracy we had before Trump. He\u2019s hit it with a wrecking ball and made it much worse."

Some other time, it could be a group in southern Colombia. It\u2019s all over the place. There\u2019s a lot of people who really are doing very serious things. Interacting with them is extremely important for me\u2014and I assume for them, because they keep asking. So, yes, all over. I must get probably a thousand letters a day. I try to answer what I can. You\u2019re famous for signing any petition sent to you. Quite a lot of them. Nowhere near all, but a fair number. If I think they have any serious merit, like maybe saving somebody\u2019s life. If I don\u2019t like the way they\u2019re framed, I won\u2019t usually sign it. I think the biggest controversy you ever had was probably the Faurisson affair. That fits into, I guess, what I said about you being willing to answer e-mails and letters and sign petitions or so on. Do you have any regrets about that and how that played out? [Four decades ago, Chomsky repeatedly defended the free-speech rights of Robert Faurisson, a French professor of literature and a Holocaust denier.] No, I have no regrets about standing up for freedom of speech and opposing the Stalinist-style laws in France\u2014which say that the state, the holy state, has the right to determine historical truth and to punish deviation from what it asserts. I have no reservations about opposing that."

    "output": "That letter was so anodyne and insignificant; I barely noticed it. The only interesting thing about that letter is the reaction to it. The reaction was extraordinary. It showed that the problem is far greater than I thought it was. Say more. The problem was that people were outraged that somebody should make an anodyne statement, a simple statement, saying we should have some commitment to freedom of speech, even views we don\u2019t like. I thought that\u2019s the kind of thing people say to each other in their sleep. But apparently many people said, \u201cNo, can\u2019t say that, too dangerous\u201d\u2014all kinds of crazed interpretations. Some of the interpretations were really wild. A lot of the protest was about the people who signed it. How can you sign a statement when such-and-such a person signs it? It takes thirty seconds of thought to understand that if you accept that principle, there are no statements, for very simple reasons. You\u2019ve gotten plenty of statements to sign. Do you know who else is going to sign it? If the question of who else signs a statement is a criterion for signing it, then nobody in their right mind ever signs anything. Just that simple point of logic couldn\u2019t fit the people who were so outraged that someone should say it\u2019s not a good idea to shut people up. Putting theHarper\u2019sletter aside, I do think that people\u2019s intentions matter and that we should take them into account. If a census worker says there are a lot of Jews working in Hollywood, stating it as a fact, that is different from Donald Trump saying it at a rally. We all know that one has different intent, and it seems like we should react to them differently based on the person saying it. Maybe this gets back to you not caring about intentions so much. Yes, people read things differently. What I\u2019m talking about is how they read it. Probably different signers had different intentions, no doubt. I can see that from the list of signers. But, as far as I was concerned, what\u2019s in the back of my mind is very straightforward, and I\u2019ve been saying it to activists for decades. Don\u2019t pick up the techniques that are used regularly by the mainstream for repression. Don\u2019t adopt them for yourself. So cancel culture didn\u2019t happen to be mentioned in the statement, but a lot of people read that into it. O.K., let\u2019s say it\u2019s talking about cancel culture. Cancel culture is all over the mainstream. I can give you plenty of examples from my own experience of things cancelled, books withdrawn, appearances on the national radio being cut off because somebody didn\u2019t like it, some manager, some right-winger didn\u2019t like it, endless numbers of this. It goes on all the time. That\u2019s standard mainstream establishment behavior. People of the left are making a serious mistake when they try to imitate it. It\u2019s wrong in principle; it\u2019s wrong tactically. It\u2019s a gift to the far right, and they run with it. They love it. In fact, Trump\u2019s building his own campaign on it. Therefore, for the left, who I\u2019m interested in, and their activists, pay attention to principle and tactical consequences. They are important. Pay attention to them and do not adopt the characteristic repressive behavior of the mainstream. That\u2019s what I took the letter to mean. I think one of the things people objected to was the letter saying that freedom of speech was becoming more and more constricted. To your point, this has always been going on, and has always been part of the mainstream, and some people thought that by saying it was getting worse, the drafters of the letter were making a specific point about the left and cancel culture. Well, what you\u2019re saying is correct. Worse, but that doesn\u2019t mean it was good before. So to add a small fraction to what the mainstream always does is a mistake. There\u2019s also a lot more openness in certain ways. People of different races and gender identities are able to speak their voices more clearly now, and that in many ways\u2014 That\u2019s all to the good. That\u2019s all positive and great. That\u2019s what activism has been about. I\u2019ve been part of it all my life and supported it, but it\u2019s a mistake when you go beyond that to try to silence others."

I\u2019m talking about the fate of African-Americans, of course. It\u2019s perfectly understandable that the marginalization, mistreatment, suppression of women\u2019s rights should be a major concern. It\u2019s also very significant to bear in mind that the United States has an unusually violent and brutal labor history and a long history of repression of labor. It\u2019s gotten much worse since the neoliberals all began. Reagan and Thatcher, both of them, or whoever was behind them, recognized, right away, that if we\u2019re going to hand everything over to the rich and the private sector, we\u2019ve got to remove people\u2019s ability to defend themselves, and the ability to defend themselves is primarily in the hands of labor unions. So the first moves they made were to impact and severely undermine the labor movement. That\u2019s a brutal part of a long history. So, yes, that must be brought in as well. Now, all of these things ought to be brought together. I\u2019m sure you recall that Martin Luther King, Jr., at the end of his life, at the point where he was sharply losing liberal support, was trying to organize a poor-people\u2019s campaign, Black and white, wherever you\u2019re from\u2014you\u2019re poor, struggling, working people. That\u2019s our campaign. That\u2019s what ought to be done. All of these concerns interact. They\u2019re integrated. They all ought to be dealt with. You can understand why, for some people, some of them are more important than others, but it\u2019s a matter of bringing them all together, because they\u2019re basically all on the same side. With regard to the huge crises that humans face, much worse than anything in their history, crises literally for the survival of humanity: on these, it\u2019s not just a matter of black and white and others; it\u2019s a matter of internationalism. These problems are all international in scale, and, going back to the Trump Administration, they\u2019re smashing to pieces every part of international co\u00f6peration. It\u2019s a major attack on the kinds of institutional structures that are going to be needed to overcome the enormous crises that are impending."

    "input": "C.J. Polychroniou: Noam, since coming to office, Trump has shown on numerous occasions that he is not a normal foreign policy president. But can you make any sense out of his stance toward Syria?",
    "output": "The first of Trump\u2019s recent steps was to withdraw the small U.S. contingent that was a deterrent to Turkey\u2019s expansion of its invasion of Syria and to authorize Erdo\u011fan\u2019s plans to extend his atrocities and ethnic cleansing of Syrian Kurds. His second step was to move U.S. troops to \u201csecure\u201d the oil-producing areas. The latter, apparently after he was told about the oil, is easy to understand. He has held all along that our only standing interest in the Middle East is to \u201csecure\u201d its oil for our own benefit. As for the first step, we can only speculate, but it seems quite likely that the motive is what guides him consistently: How will the action affect me? Trump is an effective con man who has a good sense of what animates his voting base. In this case, he presumably expected (correctly it seems) that withdrawing a few hundred troops would appeal to the sector of the population that resonates to his message that America is foolishly expending its blood and treasure to help \u201cunworthy\u201d people who don\u2019t even thank us for our sacrifices on their behalf, and that Trump is the first president to stand up for the suffering American people instead of giving everything away to foreigners out of stupidity (or treachery). It\u2019s worth recalling that repeated polls have shown that Americans vastly overestimate the scale of foreign aid \u2014 and recommend that it be considerably higher than it actually is (putting aside what constitutes \u201caid\u201d). Much has been written and said about the betrayal of the Kurds, a U.S. ally in the war against ISIS (also known as Daesh). This isn\u2019t, however, the first time that the U.S. has betrayed the Kurds and other former allies. Betrayal of the Kurds has been virtually a qualification for office since Ford-Kissinger abandoned the Kurds to the mercy of Saddam Hussein when they were no longer needed. Reagan went so far as to support his friend Saddam\u2019s chemical warfare campaign against Iraqi Kurds, seeking to shift the blame to Iran and blocking congressional efforts to respond to these hideous crimes. Clinton\u2019s method was to provide the arms for the murderous government assault on Turkish Kurds, which killed tens of thousands, wiped out 3,500 towns and villages, and drove hundreds of thousands from their homes. (See Noam Chomsky,The New Military Humanism, Chapter 3. London: Pluto Press, 1999). Clinton\u2019s flood of military aid increased along with the shocking crimes, as Turkey became the prime recipient of American arms (outside of Israel-Egypt, a separate category). Trump\u2019s contribution is particularly disgusting. The Kurds lost 11,000 soldiers, men and women, leading the war against ISIS for which Trump claims credit, helped by some U.S. special forces (five casualties are reported) and air support. Erdo\u011fan demanded that Kurds eliminate defensive fortifications (filling in trenches, etc.) near the border, and at the request of the U.S. command, they complied, trusting Washington\u2019s promise that it would protect them from a further Turkish assault. Trump\u2019s tweet broke that promise, leaving Kurds exposed to the invasion by Turkish-backed forces, most it seems jihadis and criminals. For years, Turkey has been helping tens of thousands of jihadis to flood into Syria for its anti-Assad war and to establish a Turkish presence. No surprises in how the extended Turkish assault has been carried out."

    "output": "Turkey had already invaded and occupied Kurdish-controlled regions of northern Syria, killing hundreds and displacing hundreds of thousands, with credible charges of serious war crimes. Trump\u2019s green light was for extending the operation with [the] alleged goal of ending a terrorist threat, in reality in order to put an end to the highly promising social and political achievements in Kurdish-led Rojava by violence and terror, ethnic cleansing, and resettling the region with Syrians of Turkey\u2019s choosing. On war crimes, it is well to remember the stirring words of Justice Robert Jackson, chief U.S. prosecutor at the Nuremberg Tribunal where Nazi war criminals were judged and hanged: \u201cWe must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow. To pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well. We must summon such detachment and intellectual integrity to our task that this Trial will commend itself to posterity as fulfilling humanity\u2019s aspirations to do justice.\u201d When we ask how these words have been heeded since, we know how history should judge us, and what to expect of punishment for war crimes \u2014 even in perfectly clear cases of aggression with no credible pretext, the \u201csupreme international crime\u201d of the Nuremberg judgment: the U.S.-U.K. invasion of Iraq in 2003, to take a textbook example. Continuing with the Nuremberg judgment, we might recall that \u201cto initiate a war of aggression,\u201d such as the invasion of Iraq, \u201cis not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\u201d Included in the accumulated evil of the whole is the recruitment of such militants as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who joined the resistance to the invasion and, after an education in Abu Ghraib, went on to lead the criminal enterprise ISIS, finally killed in a U.S. special forces operation on October 27."

These take no account of the fact that the Trump economy carries onward the slow Obama recovery from the Great Recession, now with a real unemployment rate of over 7 percent with almost stagnant real wages and declining benefits \u2014 and spectacular enrichment of a tiny sector to the point where over 20 percent of the country\u2019s wealth is in the hands of 0.1 percent of the population while half the population has negative net worth. In the past, these models have been accurate, though we should recall that the best predictor of electability, dramatically for Congress, is campaign spending, as Thomas Ferguson has shown, again in current work. But we are not in normal times. The Republican \u201cradical insurgency,\u201d as it was called several years ago by Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, has gone far off the traditional rails under Trump, undermining democracy and posing an extraordinary threat to the persistence of organized human life on earth \u2014 in the all-too-near future. How such factors will enter into the election is not easy to say, though it is unfortunately not difficult to predict the consequences of four more years of Trumpism."

Polychroniou: Over the course of the past few decades, the Republican Party has gone through a series of ideological transformations \u2014 from traditional conservatism to reactionism and finally to what we may define as \u201cproto-fascism\u201d where the irrational has become the driving force. How do we explain what has happened to the GOP?",
    "output": "Your term \u201cneoliberal proto-fascism\u201d seems to me quite an accurate characterization of the current Republican organization \u2014 I\u2019m hesitant to call them a \u201cParty\u201d because that might suggest that they have some interest in participating honestly in normal parliamentary politics. More fitting, I think, is the judgment of American Enterprise Institute political analysts Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein that the modern Republican Party has transformed to a \u201cradical insurgency\u201d with disdain for democratic participation. That was before the Trump-McConnell hammer blows of the past few years, which drove the conclusion home more forcefully. The term \u201cneoliberal proto-fascism\u201d captures well both the features of the current party and the distinction from the fascism of the past. The commitment to the most brutal form of neoliberalism is apparent in the legislative record, crucially the subordination of the party to private capital, the inverse of classic fascism. But the fascist symptoms are there, including extreme racism, violence, worship of the leader (sent by God, according to former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo), immersion in a world of \u201calternative facts\u201d and a frenzy of irrationality. Also in other ways, such as the extraordinary efforts in Republican-run states to suppress teaching in schools that doesn\u2019t conform to their white supremacist doctrines. Legislation is being enacted to ban instruction in \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d the new demon, replacing Communism and Islamic terror as the plague of the modern age. \u201cCritical race theory\u201d is the scare-phrase used for the study of the systematic structural and cultural factors in the hideous 400-year history of slavery and enduring racist repression. Proper indoctrination in schools and universities must ban this heresy. What actually happened for 400 years and is very much alive today must be presented to students as a deviation from the real America, pure and innocent, much as in well-run totalitarian states. What\u2019s missing from \u201cproto-fascism\u201d is the ideology: state control of the social order, including the business classes, and party control of the state with the maximal leader in charge. That could change. German industry and finance at first thought they could use the Nazis as their instrument in beating down labor and the left while remaining in charge. They learned otherwise. The current split between the more traditional corporate leadership and the Trump-led party is suggestive of something similar, but only remotely. We are far from the conditions that led to Mussolini, Hitler, and their cohorts. On the driving force of irrationality, the facts are inescapable and should be of deep concern. Though we can\u2019t credit Trump entirely with the achievement, he certainly has shown great skill in carrying out a challenging assignment: implementing policies for the benefit of his primary constituency of great wealth and corporate power while conning the victims into worshipping him as their savior. That\u2019s no mean achievement, and inducing an atmosphere of utter irrationality has been a primary instrument, a virtual prerequisite. We should distinguish the voting base, now pretty much owned by Trump, from the political echelon (Congress) \u2014 and distinguish both from a more shadowy elite that really runs the Party, McConnell and associates. Attitudes among the voting base are truly ominous. Put aside the fact that a large majority of Trump voters believe that the elections were stolen. A majority also believe that \u201cThe traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it\u201d and 40 percent take a stronger stand: \u201cif elected leaders will not protect America, the people must do it themselves, even if it requires violent actions.\u201d Not surprising, perhaps, when a quarter of Republicans are reported to believe that \u201cthe government, media, and financial worlds in the US are controlled by a group of Satan-worshipping pedophiles who run a global child sex trafficking operation.\u201d In the background are more realistic concerns about the disappearance of \u201cthe traditional American way of life\u201d: a Christian and white supremacist world where Black people \u201cknow their place\u201d and there are no infections from \u201cdeviants\u201d who call for gay rights and other such obscenities. That traditional way of life indeed is disappearing. There are also elements of realism in the various \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theories that seem to consume much of the Trump base. Putting aside absurdities about immigration and elite plotting, a simple look at distribution of births suffices to show that white domination is declining. It\u2019s also worth remembering the deep roots of these concerns. Among the founders, there were two distinguished figures of the Enlightenment, one of whom hoped that the new country would be free of \u201cblot or mixture,\u201d red or black (Jefferson), while the other felt that Germans and Swedes should perhaps be barred entry because they are too \u201cswarthy\u201d (Franklin). Myths of Anglo-Saxon origin were prevalent through the 19th century. All of this is apart from the virulent racism and its horrifying manifestations. Concerns about satanic cults are dangerous enough, but other deeply irrational beliefs are far more consequential. One of the most threatening revelations of recent days was a scarcely noticed observation in the latest report of a Yale University group that monitors attitudes on climate change \u2014 the euphemism for the heating of the planet that will end organized human life on earth unless soon brought under control. The report found that \u201cOver the past year, there has been a sharp decline in the percentages of both liberal/moderate Republicans and conservative Republicans who think developing sources of clean energy should be a priority for the president and Congress. The current numbers are all-time lows since we first asked the question in 2010.\u201d Meanwhile every day\u2019s news provides information about new potential disasters \u2014 for example, the June 11 release of studies reporting the accelerated collapse of a huge Antarctic glacier that might raise sea levels by a foot and a half \u2014 along with reminders by the scientists reporting the warning that \u201cThe future is still open to change \u2014 if people do what is needed to change it.\u201d They won\u2019t, as long as the reported attitudes prevail. Unless overcome, they might be a kiss of death if the current strategy of the Republican Party succeeds in putting the wreckers back in power. The strategy is plain enough: no matter what the harm to the country, and to their own voting base, ensure that the Biden administration can do nothing to remedy severe domestic problems, and ram through Jim Crow-style legislation to block voting of people of color and the poor, counting on the acquiescence of the reactionary judiciary that McConnell-Trump have succeeded in installing. The party is not a lost cause. The Democrats have helped by failing to provide a constructive alternative that answers to the needs and just aspirations of many of those who have flocked to the Trump banner. That can change. Furthermore, attitudes are shifting among younger Republicans, even among younger Evangelicals, a core part of the Republican base since the \u201870s. Nothing is irremediable. With regard to the political echelon, there is little to say. With fringe exceptions, they have abandoned any semblance of integrity. Current votes are a clear indication: Total Republican opposition to measures that they know are favored by their constituents in order to ensure that the Biden administration can achieve nothing. The most abject capitulation of the political echelon was on global warming. In 2008, Republican presidential candidate John McCain had a limited climate plank in his program, and congressional Republicans were considering related legislation. The Koch energy conglomerate responded in force, and any spark of independence was extinguished. That much was evident in the last Republican primaries in 2016, pre-Trump: 100 percent denial that what is happening is happening, or worse, saying maybe it is but we\u2019re going to race toward disaster without apologizing (as said John Kasich, who was honored for his integrity by being invited to speak at the 2020 Democratic convention)."

For a long time, the party elite has been a rich man\u2019s club, pandering to business power even more than the Democrats, even after the Democrats abandoned the working class in the \u201870s, becoming a party of Wall St. and affluent professionals.

The McConnell types who run the party are caught between a raging voting base in thrall to Trump and the masters of the economy whom they serve. A commission of inquiry, if at all honest, would have deepened this rift, which they have to find a way to paper over if the party, such as it is, is to survive. Best then to cancel it."

    "input": "Lies, propaganda, and restricting voting rights have become the governing principles of today\u2019s GOP. To what extent will the new voting restrictions work to the advantage of the Republican Party, and how will they impact on the current political climate in general and the future of whatever is left of democracy in the United States in particular?",
    "output": "Trump\u2019s highly effective strategy of legitimizing \u201calternative facts\u201d was based on an endless flood of lies, but a few true statements floated in the debris. One was his comment that Republicans can never win a fair election. That\u2019s a real problem for the rich man\u2019s club. It\u2019s hard to garner votes with the slogan \u201cI want to rob you. Vote for me.\u201d That leaves only a few options. One is to prevent the \u201cwrong people\u201d from voting. Another is to shape the party program so that policy is concealed by appeals to \u201ccultural issues.\u201d Both have been actively pursued. Trump gave the practices a particularly vulgar twist in his usual style, but he didn\u2019t invent them. The current wave of Republican Jim Crow-style legislation is understandable: Trump\u2019s observation is accurate, and is likely to be more so in the future with demographic changes and the tendency of younger voters to favor social justice and human rights, among Republicans as well. The efforts have become more feasible after the Roberts Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby decision in 2013, which \u201cset the stage for a new era of white hegemony,\u201d as Vann Newkirk rightly observed. Displacement of policy by \u201ccultural issues\u201d traces back to Nixon\u2019s southern strategy. With Democrats beginning to support mild civil rights legislation, Nixon and his advisers recognized that they could switch the southern vote to Republican by racist appeals, barely disguised. Under Reagan there was little disguise; racist rhetoric and practices came naturally to him. Meanwhile the Republican Christian nationalist strategist Paul Weyrich easily convinced the political leadership that by abandoning their former \u201cpro-choice\u201d stands and pretending to oppose abortion, they could pick up the northern Catholic and newly politicized Evangelical vote. Gun-loving was soon added to the mix, by now reaching such weird absurdities as the recent Benitez decision overturning California\u2019s ban on assault rifles, which are, after all, hardly different from Swiss army knives [according to Benitez]. Trump added more to the mix. Like his fellow demagogues in Europe, he understood well that refugees can be used to whip up xenophobic passions and fears. His racist appeals also went beyond the norm. Trump has exhibited a certain genius in tapping poisons that run not far below the surface of American society and culture. By such means, he managed to capture the Republican voting base. The party leadership is dedicated to the obstructionist strategy of sacrificing the interests of the country in order to regain power. That leaves the country with one functioning political party, itself torn between the neoliberal leadership and a younger social democratic voting base. Your phrase \u201cwhatever is left of American democracy\u201d is to the point. However progressive it might have been in the 18th century \u2014 and there is much to say about that \u2014 by today\u2019s standards American democracy is deeply flawed in ways that were already becoming clear to the leading Framer, James Madison by 1791, when he wrote to Jefferson deploring \u201cthe daring depravity of the times,\u201d as the \u201cstockjobbers will become the pretorian band of the government \u2014 at once its tools and its tyrant; bribed by its largesses, and overawing it by clamors and combinations.\u201d That could well be a description of recent years, particularly as the neoliberal assault achieved its entirely predictable consequence of placing government even more at the command of concentrations of private power than before. The \u201clargesses\u201d are too familiar to review. Ample research in mainstream political science has shown that the \u201cclamors and combinations\u201d have left the majority of voters unrepresented, as their own representatives heed the voices of the super-rich, wealthy donors and corporate lobbyists. The most recent study, using sophisticated AI techniques, dispels \u201cnotions that anyone\u2019s opinion about public policy outside of the top 10 percent of affluent Americans independently helps to explain policy.\u201d Thomas Ferguson, the leading academic scholar of the power of the \u201ctools and tyrants\u201d of government, concludes: \u201cKnowing the policy area, the preferences of the top 10 percent, and the views of a handful of interest groups suffice to explain policy changes with impressive accuracy.\u201d But some vestiges of democracy remain, even after the neoliberal assault. Probably not for long if neoliberal \u201cproto-fascism\u201d extends its sway. But the fate of democracy won\u2019t actually matter much if the \u201cproto-fascists\u201d regain power. The environment that sustains life cannot long endure the wreckers of the Trump era of decline. Little else will matter if irreversible tipping points are passed."

Polychroniou: According to popular conception, the United States is a \u201cnation of immigrants,\u201d although this formulation significantly excludes Native people \u2014 who were already here, and were subjected to colonization, displacement and genocide at the hands of European immigrants \u2014 and also excludes African Americans, whose ancestors were kidnapped and enslaved. When it is described as a \u201cnation of immigrants,\u201d the U.S. is often portrayed as a varied nation where people have the freedom to pursue their dreams of a better life while maintaining their own cultural, ethnic and religious distinctiveness or uniqueness. Yet, the truth of the matter is that inequality and oppression of the \u201cOther\u201d have been ongoing political and social realities since the origins of the republic. In fact, today we have a president in the White House who makes no bones about wishing to see non-white people, even elected representatives of the U.S. Congress, leave the country because they challenge the status quo and seek a United States with a more humane and democratic polity. Meanwhile, the very rich are enjoying political privileges like never before. Noam, what are some of the tangible and intangible factors that seem to be pushing the country \u2014 socially, politically and economically \u2014 backward rather than forward?",
    "output": "Trump\u2019s diatribes successfully inflame his audience, many of whom apparently feel deeply threatened by diversity, cultural change, or simply the recognition that the White Christian nation of their collective imagination is changing before their eyes. White supremacy is nothing new in the U.S. The late George Frederickson\u2019s comparative studies of white supremacy found the U.S. to be almost off the chart, more extreme even than Apartheid South Africa. As late as the 1960s the U.S. had anti-miscegenation laws so extreme that the Nazis refused to adopt them as a model for their racist Nuremberg laws. And the power of Southern Democrats was so great that until \u201860s activism shattered the framework of legal racism \u2014 if not its practice by other means \u2014 even New Deal federal housing programs enforced segregation, barring Black people from new housing programs. It goes back to the country\u2019s origins. While progressive in many ways by the standards of the day, the U.S. was founded on two brutal racist principles: the most hideous system of slavery in human history, the source of much of its wealth (and England\u2019s too), and the need to rid the national territory of Native Americans, whom the Declaration of Independence explicitly describes as \u201cthe merciless Indian savages,\u201d and whom the framers saw as barring the expansion of the \u201csuperior\u201d race. Immigrants ... were supposed to be white immigrants \u2014 in fact, basically \u201cAnglo-Saxon,\u201d in accord with weird racist myths of the founding fathers that persisted through the 19th century. That includes the leading Enlightenment figures. Benjamin Franklin urged that Germans and Swedes be barred because they were too \u201cswarthy.\u201d Thomas Jefferson was greatly interested in Anglo-Saxon language and law, part of his immersion in the \u201cSaxon myth\u201d that English democracy and law trace back to a pre-Norman Saxon period. The first Naturalization Act, 1790, restricted the option to whites, extended to ex-slaves after the Civil war. The country of course needed immigrants to settle the \u201cIndian country\u201d from which Indigenous nations were expelled or \u201cexterminated\u201d (as the Founders put it). But they were supposed to be \u201cwhite\u201d \u2014 a somewhat flexible culturally constructed category. By the late 19th century, Asians were excluded by law. The first more general immigration law was in 1924, designed to bar Jews and Italians primarily. There is no need to review here the horrendous record of how Jews were prevented from fleeing Nazi barbarism, crimes that persisted even after the war. Truman sent Earl Harrison on a mission to inspect the concentration camps where Jews were still held, under grotesque conditions as he reported. About the only effect was to intensify efforts to ship them to Palestine. The 1924 law remained in place until 1965. By the 1980s immigration began to be criminalized. Treatment of Haitians fleeing terror was particularly despicable. Guant\u00e1namo was first used as a detention center by the Bush I and Clinton administrations, a place to get rid of Black people fleeing in terror from the murderous coup regime that [U.S. leaders] were supporting, despite pretenses to the contrary. They were classified as \u201ceconomic migrants,\u201d a cynical pretense in gross violation of international law and minimal decency. Another ugly story. It\u2019s not terribly surprising, then, to read a report of a conference of conservative intellectuals where one esteemed speaker, University of Pennsylvania Law professor Amy Wax, explains learnedly that \u201cour country will be better off with more whites and fewer nonwhites,\u201d since immigrants may not quickly come to \u201cthink, live and act just like us\u201d because the social and cultural climate of their places of origin. Wax failed to elaborate on whether her parents, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, came from a cultural and social climate where people were thinking and acting like \u201cus.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to understand why these deep currents are becoming more manifest, and ominous, today, after 40 years of the \u201csavage capitalism\u201d unleashed by the neoliberal assault. It\u2019s enough to recall that for a large majority of the workforce, wages have either stagnated or declined since 1979, when the neoliberal assault was just taking off. From the country\u2019s origins, U.S. workers benefited from the world\u2019s highest wages.... Since the 1980s, though the unusual advantages persist, working people have fallen behind the rest of the developed world by many measures. For review of their current status, see Amanda Novella and Jeff Madrick\u2019s February 2019 contribution to the journalChallenge. The effects of the assault are sharp concentration of wealth and power, increasingly in largely predatory financial institutions, stagnation or decline for the majority, deterioration of benefits, astonishing collapse of infrastructure, a form of globalization designed to pit working people against one another for the benefit of international investors, weakening of institutions to protect worker rights, undermining of functioning democracy, and much else that is all too familiar. The result, in the U.S. and in Europe, is an upsurge of anger, resentment and, all too often, a search for scapegoats \u2014 typically those even more disadvantaged, who are portrayed as being coddled by liberal elites. It\u2019s a dangerous mix: fertile territory for demagogues. The threats are far more extreme than the incipient fascist-style tendencies, which are severe enough. It cannot be overlooked that humans are facing a decision of extraordinary significance, which must be made very soon: Will organized human society survive in anything like its present form, or will it be devastated by global catastrophe? The two most ominous threats are nuclear war and environmental catastrophe, both increasing. On the latter, major energy corporations are apparently planning on a future with 5o Celsius above pre-industrial levels by mid-century, and with that in mind, are racing to accelerate what climate scientists recognize to be indescribable catastrophe by maximizing the profitable production of fossil fuels, joined by the biggest banks and other major capitalist institutions. Meanwhile the Republican administration, determined to safeguard its credentials as the most dangerous organization in human history, is anticipating a slightly less overwhelming catastrophe \u2014 a rise of 4o[C] by end of the century, also far above what scientists recognize to be a colossal danger. And it concludes from this detailed environmental assessment that we should not limit automotive emissions, because \u2014 what\u2019s the difference? We\u2019re going over the cliff anyway. If there is anything like this in world history, I haven\u2019t found it. And this passes with scarcely a raised eyebrow. Of course, this is only science, and as [right-wing radio host] Rush Limbaugh instructs his tens of millions of radio listeners, science is one of the \u201cfour corners of deceit,\u201d along with government, academia, and media (of the wrong sort). All of this tells us that the tasks ahead are urgent, on many fronts."

Yet, this is a country where it is immensely difficult to change even outdated and dysfunctional political processes and institutions, such as the Electoral College and the distribution of Senate seats. It is very hard to pass amendments to the Constitution. And so far, we have faced many barriers to moving away from the two-party system. How do we explain the inflexibility of U.S. political processes and institutions?",
    "output": "In the 19th century the U.S. Constitution was in many ways a progressive document, even though it was a \u201cFramers\u2019 Coup\u201d against the democratic aspirations of most of the public \u2014 the title of Michael Klarman\u2019s impressive study of the making of the Constitution, generally regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d in the scholarly literature. The document has inherent problems, which are leading to a likely constitutional crisis. The problems are serious enough for law professor Erwin Chemerinsky, writing on \u201cAmerica\u2019s constitutional crisis,\u201d to entitle his article \u201cThe First Priority: Making America a Democracy\u201d (contrary to the intentions of the Framers). He reviews some of the familiar problems. One has to do with the Electoral College, which was designed by the Framers because of their distrust of popular government. By now states with 23 percent of the population have enough electoral votes to choose the president. Even more importantly, the same radical imbalance makes the Senate a highly undemocratic institution \u2014 in accord with the intentions of the Framers. In Madison\u2019s constitutional design, the Senate was the most powerful branch of government, and the most protected from public interference. It was to represent \u201cthe wealth of the nation,\u201d the most \u201cresponsible\u201d men, who have sympathy for property and its rights. Furthermore, though the Framers did not anticipate this of course, social and demographic changes have placed this excessive anti-democratic power in the hands of a part of the population that is mostly rural, white, Christian, socially conservative and traditionalist \u2014 generally sympathetic to the Wax principle. Some of these undemocratic features were virtually unavoidable. The Constitution would never have been ratified if the smaller colonies were not granted an equal voice. But by now the effects are severe \u2014 and unchangeable by amendment because of the same radical imbalance in voting power. These problems are exacerbated by the monopolization of politics by the two political parties and \u201cwinner take all\u201d state laws that bar proportional representation, which can permit a variety of voices to enter the political arena, sometimes growing to major parties. Some have argued, not implausibly, that if a country with the U.S. system tried to join the European Union, the application might be rejected by the European Court of Justice. The impending crisis is becoming more severe because of the malevolence of the Republican leadership. They are well aware that their formula of abject service to wealth and corporate power along with mobilization of a voting base of the kind that shows up at Trump rallies is not enough to overcome their growing minority status. The solution is radical gerrymandering of the kind now authorized by the reactionary Roberts Court, and stacking the judiciary with far-right justices who will be able to hold the country by the throat for many years. Here the evil genius is Mitch McConnell, who maneuvered to block appointments under Obama, a campaign of obstruction that left 106 vacancies at the end of Obama\u2019s second term (including the scandalous case of Merrick Garland), and is now rushing through appointment of Federalist Society choices."

Almost 80 percent of Americans believe in miracles. There is a huge Evangelical community, a large part of Trump\u2019s base, which he keeps in line by throwing them crumbs. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a devout Evangelical Christian, speculated recently that God might have sent Trump to save Israel from Iran \u2014 which is threatening Israel with destruction in the fantasy world of doctrinal verities. Fully 40 percent of Americans expect Jesus to return to earth by mid-century (23 percent certainly). It\u2019s possible that this accounts for some of the \u201clooking away\u201d that we were discussing earlier.

Given that, should we interpret Trumpism as a political phenomenon akin to the same dynamics that gave rise in the prewar era to fascism and other forms of authoritarian rule in Europe and elsewhere?",
    "output": "Already in the 1950s, economist John Kenneth Galbraith described U.S. society as marked by private affluence, public squalor. It\u2019s true that in the public sphere it often resembles a \u201cthird world\u201d country. The Infrastructure Report Card of the American Society of Civil Engineers regularly ranks the U.S. down at the bottom, D+. And one can hardly walk through a U.S. city or travel in poor rural areas without being shocked at the squalor. The same holds for social justice measures. Among OECD countries, the U.S. ranks near the bottom. I don\u2019t think this relates specifically to Trumpism, except insofar as the contemporary Republican Party leadership is a virtual caricature of long-standing features of U.S. political economy, based on business power that is unusual by historical standards, with a pervasive impact on the political system and also on the \u201chegemonic common sense,\u201d in Gramscian terms. The business classes are not just unusually powerful, but are also highly class conscious, constantly engaged in bitter class war, in some ways vulgar Marxists, with values inverted. There is variation. The New Deal period brought the U.S. somewhat closer to European-style social democracy, but from the \u201880s that has been sharply reversed. By now, when Bernie Sanders calls for renewing and extending the New Deal \u2014 ideas that would not have greatly surprised Eisenhower \u2014 he is considered a radical who wants to destroy \u201cAmerican values.\u201d Trumpism and pre-war fascism seems to me a different matter. There surely are resemblances. Just speaking personally, Trump\u2019s Greenville, North Carolina, rally evoked my childhood memories of listening on the radio to Hitler\u2019s Nuremberg rallies, not understanding the words but the mood was apparent enough, and frightening. The not-so-subtle appeals to racism, xenophobia, misogyny, the treachery of dissent, demonization of media that do not kowtow abjectly to the Grand Leader \u2014 all this and more is reminiscent of pre-war fascism. And the social base of Trumpism has similarities to prewar fascism as well: superrich power and petty bourgeois popular base. But prewar fascism was based on control of all aspects of the society \u2014 business included \u2014 by a powerful state in the hands of a totalitarian all-powerful ruling party: Gleichschaltung. The situation here is quite different, almost the opposite, with the increasingly monopolized business world, particularly its financial sector, having overwhelming power in sociopolitical life and doctrinal management...."

As for China, it has made substantial economic and technological progress, but remains a very poor country. It is ranked 86th in the 2018 update to the UN Development Index, right below Algeria. (India is ranked 130th, barely above East Timor.) China has huge internal problems unknown in the West. It is argued that China is comparable to the U.S., maybe ahead, in Purchasing Power Parity, but that means that it is far below per capita. China has been pursuing systematic plans to expand its influence through Eurasia in a somewhat uneasy partnership with an economically much weaker Russia, first through the Shanghai Cooperation Council, now with the Belt and Road Initiative. In some areas of technology \u2014 solar panels, electric cars \u2014 it may be in the lead. But it still has a long way to go to reach the level of the rich industrial societies. The U.S. is concerned with Chinese growth, and is seeking (pretty openly) to impede it \u2014 not a very attractive policy stance. It\u2019s also worth bearing in mind that in the age of neoliberal globalization, national accounts are a less meaningful measure of economic power than in the past. Political economist Sean Starrs has done informative work on a different measure: proportion of world wealth held by domestically based multinational corporations. By that measure the U.S. is far in the lead internationally, owning a spectacular 50 percent of world wealth \u2014 more than the U.S. share of global GDP at the peak of its power in 1945 \u2014 and U.S. corporations are in the lead in just about every category. China is sure to have a major role in world affairs. A sane policy would be accommodation and cooperation, which doesn\u2019t seem out of the range of possibility."

As it should, considering what\u2019s been happening in the past year. The challenges it highlighted last January remain at the top of the list: nuclear war, global heating, and other environmental destruction, and the collapse of the arena of rational discourse that offers the only hope for addressing the existential challenges. There are others, but let\u2019s look at these. Washington has just agreed to provide Ukraine with Patriot missiles. Whether they work or not is an open question, but Russia will assume a worst-case analysis and consider them a target. We have few details, but it\u2019s likely that U.S. trainers come with the missiles, hence are targets for Russian attack, which might move us a few steps up the escalation ladder. That\u2019s not the only possible ominous scenario in Ukraine, but the threats of escalation to unthinkable war are not just there. It\u2019s dangerous enough off the coast of China, particularly as Biden has declared virtual war on China and Congress is seething at the bit to break the \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d that has maintained peace regarding Taiwan for 50 years, all matters we\u2019ve discussed before. Without proceeding, the threat of terminal war has increased, along with foolish and ignorant assurances that it need not concern us. Let\u2019s turn to the environment. On global warming, the news ranges from awful to horrendous, but there are some bright spots. The Biodiversity Convention is a major step toward limiting the lethal destruction of the environment. Support is almost universal, though not total. One state refused to sign, the usual outlier, the most powerful state in world history. The GOP, true to its principles, refuses to support anything that might interfere with private power and profit. For similar reasons, the U.S. refused to sign the Kyoto Protocols on global warming (joined in this case by Andorra), setting in motion a disastrous failure to act that has sharply reduced the prospects for escape from catastrophe. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that the world is saintly. Far from it. But the global hegemon stands out. Let\u2019s turn to the third factor driving the Doomsday Clock toward midnight: the collapse of the arena of rational discourse. Most discussion of this deeply troubling phenomenon focuses on outbursts in social media, wild conspiracy theories, QAnon and stolen elections, and other dangerous developments that can be traced in large part to the breakdown of the social order under the hammer blows of the class war of the past 40 years. But at least we have the sober and reasoned domain of liberal intellectual opinion that offers some hope of rational discourse."

As the sane parts of the world also recognized at once, the most likely culprit is the only one that had both motive and capability. U.S. motive is not in question.

Rather, point somewhere else and shout \u201cthief, thief,\u201d acknowledging that there is a robbery while shifting attention to some imagined perpetrator. It works very well. The fossil fuel industry has been practicing it effectively for years, as we\u2019ve discussed. It works even better when embellished by the standard techniques that make U.S. propaganda so much more effective than the heavy-handed totalitarian variety: foster debate to show our openness, but within narrow constraints that instill the propaganda message by presupposition, which is much more effective than assertion. So, highlight the fact that there is skepticism about Russian depravity, showing what a free and open society we are while establishing more deeply the ludicrous claim that the propaganda system is seeking to instill. There is, to be sure, another possibility: Perhaps segments of the intellectual classes are so deeply immersed in the propaganda system that they actually can\u2019t perceive the absurdity of what they are saying. Either way, it\u2019s a stark reminder of the collapse of the arena of rational discourse, right where we might hope that it could be defended. Unfortunately, it\u2019s all too easy to continue. In short, all three of the reasons why the Clock had been moved to 100 seconds to midnight have been strongly reinforced in the past year. Not a comforting conclusion, but inescapable."

It is a task of particular importance in the \u201crogue state leading the world toward ecological collapse.\u201d It is also a task of difficulty, given that denialism not only exists in some circles but has been close to official policy in the Republican Party ever since this extremist organization succumbed to the offensive of the Koch energy conglomerate, launched when the party seemed to be veering toward sanity during the 2008 McCain campaign.

    "input": "Recently, we discussed in another interviewthe aims and effects of neoliberal capitalism. Now, neoliberalism is often enough conflated with globalization, but it is rather obvious that the latter is a multidimensional process that has existed long before the rise of neoliberalism. Of course, the dominant form of globalization today is neoliberal globalization, but this is not to say that globalization must be structured around neoliberal policies and values, or to think that \u201cthere is no alternative.\u201d There are indeed continuous struggles across the world for democratic control over states, markets and corporations. My question thus is this: Is it utopian thinking to believe that the status quo can be challenged and that another world is possible?",
    "output": "Globalization simply means international integration. It can take many forms. The neoliberal globalization crafted mostly during the Clinton years was designed in the interest of private capital, with an array of highly protectionist investor-rights agreements masked as \u201cfree trade.\u201d That was by no means inevitable. Both the labor movement, and Congress\u2019s own research bureau (the Office of Technology Assessment, or OTA) proposed alternatives geared to the interests of working people in the U.S. and abroad. They were summarily dismissed. The OTA was disbanded, according to reports, because Newt Gingrich\u2019s GOP regarded it as biased against them, though it may be that Clintonite New Democrats shared the sentiment about fact and reason. Capital flourished, including the mostly predatory financial system. Labor was severely weakened, with consequences that reverberate to the present. Globalization could take a very different form, just as economic arrangements can quite generally. There is a long history of efforts to separate the political from the economic domain, the latter conceived as purely objective, like astronomy, guided by specialists in the economics profession and immune to the agency of ordinary citizens, labor in particular. One very impressive recent study, by Clara Mattei, argues persuasively that this dichotomy, typically taking the form of austerity programs, has been a major instrument of class war for a century, paving the way to fascism, which was indeed welcomed by Western elite opinion, with enthusiasm by \u201clibertarians.\u201d There is, however, no reason to accept the mythology. The political domain in a broad sense, including labor and other popular activism, can shape the economic system in ways that will benefit people, not profit and private power. The rise of social democracy illustrates that well, but there is also no reason to accept its tacit assumption that capitalist autocracy is a law of nature. To quote Mattei, \u201ceither the organizations of people can move beyond capitalist relations [to economic democracy], or the ruling class will reimpose its rule.\u201d The status quo can certainly be challenged. A far better world is surely within reach. There is every reason to honor the slogan of the World Social Forum that \u201cAnother world is possible,\u201d a far better one, and to devote our efforts to bring it to reality."

These policies of the last generation, the neoliberal policies that have led to these conditions we\u2019ve been talking about, the so-called New Democrats, the Clinton Democrats, have been right at the forefront. Say, deregulation of financial institutions, one of Clinton\u2019s great achievements, which led directly to the financial crisis, along with\u2014one of the factors that led to it\u2014his attack on the welfare program. Lots that we can blame them for. In fact, I should say that some of the things that Trump has done, which are\u2014which merit praise, are bitterly attacked by the Democrats and by the Republican hawks, in particular, with regard to Korea. In April, last April, the two Koreas, North and South, issued a historic declaration, Panmunjom Declaration, in which they laid out for the first time fairly detailed plans and moves towards a reduction of tension, reconciliation, a reduction of weaponry, denuclearization. Very sensible, detailed plans. And they virtually pleaded with the outside world, meaning the United States, not to interfere. What they said is, the two Koreas will proceed with these plans on their own accord\u2014crucially. In other words, let us do it. Trump, to his credit, has not interfered. The Singapore summit, for which he was lambasted, was one of his more\u2014one of his very few admirable achievements. He not only did not intervene, but he even withdrew what he correctly described as provocative U.S.-South Korean military operations. Well, all of that should be supported. I don\u2019t know what his reasons were, maybe ridiculous reasons, but doesn\u2019t matter. These are moves that should be supported. Those are the things for which he\u2019s being bitterly attacked.

Do you still think this, or is the small but growing shift in the younger wing of the Democratic Party a promising sign of change?",
    "output": "There have been changes, even before the recent shift you mention. Both parties shifted to the right during the neoliberal years: the mainstream Democrats became something like the former moderate Republicans, and the Republicans drifted virtually off the spectrum. There\u2019s merit, I think, in the observation by Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein that increasingly since the Newt Gingrich years\u2014and strikingly in Mitch McConnell\u2019s Senate\u2014the Republican Party has become a \u201cradical insurgency\u201d that is largely abandoning normal parliamentary politics. That shift\u2014which predates Donald Trump\u2014has created a substantial gap between the two parties. In the media it\u2019s often called \u201cpolarization,\u201d but that\u2019s hardly an accurate description. \u2018Sanders\u2019s platform wouldn\u2019t have greatly surprised Dwight Eisenhower, who argued that anyone who challenged New Deal programs didn\u2019t belong in the U.S. political system.\u2019 Both in the United States and Europe, neoliberal/austerity programs have sharply concentrated wealth while also stagnating wages for the majority, undermining benefits, eroding functioning democracy, and encouraging what former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan hailed as \u201cgrowing worker insecurity.\u201d These socioeconomic policies, quite naturally, have engendered anger, resentment, and bitterness\u2014which are often exploited by demagogues. As centrist political institutions have declined, sometimes virtually disappearing, both political parties have been affected. The Republican establishment used to be able to crush extremist candidates who rose from the voting base in primaries, but not in 2016. Among Democrats, the Bernie Sanders campaign broke sharply with over a century of U.S. political history by achieving remarkable success both without support from private wealth and corporate power and in the face of disregard from the media and contempt by Party managers. Sanders\u2019s success both reflects and has contributed to the shift among the younger wing that you mention, which has a great deal of promise, I think. But what Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez mean by \u201csocialism\u201d seems to be something similar to New Deal social democracy. Sanders\u2019s platform, for example, wouldn\u2019t have greatly surprised Dwight Eisenhower, who argued strongly that anyone who challenged New Deal programs didn\u2019t belong in the U.S. political system\u2014an indication of how far to the right politics has drifted in the neoliberal years."

    "input": "SC:Unsurprisingly, there has been a lot of debate trying to define socialism. You have quoted Anton Pannekoek for saying socialism is \u201cworkers themselves being masters over production.\u201d Can you elaborate on what this might look like?",
    "output": "Pannekoek is voicing the conventional understanding of socialism in its early years, before it was transmuted to efforts to soften the harsh edges of capitalist oppression and came to be associated with the monstrous perversion of socialism in Bolshevik Russia. A genuine left Marxist and leading figure in the council Communist movement, Pannekoek was one of the \u201cinfantile ultra-leftists\u201d against whom Lenin inveighed. The idea that workers themselves should be masters of production is a natural inheritor of core ideals of classical liberalism from John Locke to Thomas Paine to Abraham Lincoln and John Stuart Mill, all of whom regarded wage labor as a form of servitude that should not exist in a free society. The underlying conception was graphically expressed by the great humanist Wilhelm von Humboldt, one of the founders of classical liberalism: \u201cWhatever does not spring from a man\u2019s free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness.\u201d When the laborer works under external control, \u201cwe may admire what he does, but we despise what he is,\u201d which is a tool in the hands of others, not a free person. More significantly, this was the understanding of working people in the early days of the industrial revolution, many of them young women, \u201cfactory girls,\u201d driven from farms to work in the mills. They had a lively independent press, in which they condemned \u201cthe blasting influence of monarchical principles [of capitalism] on democratic soil.\u201d They recognized that this assault on elementary human rights will not be overcome until \u201cthey who work in the mills own them,\u201d and sovereignty is in the hands of free producers. Then working people will no longer be \u201cmenials or the humble subjects of a foreign despot . . . slaves in the strictest sense of the word.\u201d Rather, they will regain their status as \u201cfree American citizens.\u201d Workers 170 years ago warned, perceptively, that a day might come when wage slaves \u201cwill so far forget what is due to manhood as to glory in a system forced on them by their necessity and in opposition to their feelings of independence and self-respect.\u201d They hoped that that day would be \u201cfar distant.\u201d \u2018The core principle of anarchism is the recognition that structures of domination and control are not self-justifying. They carry a burden of proof, and when that cannot be met, they should be dismantled.\u2019 The solution was as clear to working people as to leading political thinkers. Mill wrote that \u201cThe form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected to predominate is . . . the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers electable and removable by themselves.\u201d This thought evolved into Pannekoek\u2019s workers\u2019 councils and is hardly a utopian ideal. As philosopher Elizabeth Anderson has recently emphasized, most people today spend the bulk of their waking lives as subjects of private tyrannies in which their rights are restricted beyond the norm of totalitarian states\u2014when they can go to the bathroom or talk to a friend, let alone play some role in determining the conditions of work or the goals of the enterprise. There are now successful worker-owned enterprises ranging from huge conglomerates such as Mondragon in the Basque country to small-scale firms in the old rust belt, with varying degrees of authentic self-management. There is also a proliferation of cooperatives, localism, and other initiatives that open the way to a revival of the consciousness and could flourish in more free and just societies."

    "output": "Highly problematic. Formal public participation keeps to the ritual of pushing buttons in the quadrennial extravaganzas (i.e., elections), which effectively abandons the regular political engagement that is the foundation of functioning democracy. The U.S. political system is regressive in important ways. Some commentators have argued that if a country with this system sought to join the EU, it would probably be barred by the European Court of Justice. The Senate is, of course, grossly undemocratic, a residue of compromises to ensure ratification of the Constitution, and unchangeable by amendment because of the voting power of the smaller states. Same with the electoral college. This lack of proportional representation virtually guarantees the two-party monopoly. Worst of all, as research by Thomas Ferguson and his colleagues has shown, electability for both Congress and the Executive is predictable with remarkable precision from the single variable of campaign spending. One consequence is that representatives spend hours a day appealing to donors while corporate lobbyists (whose ranks have exploded during the neoliberal years) meet with staffs to craft legislation. Studies by Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page have shown that the majority of voters are literally unrepresented, in that there is virtually no correlation between their preferences and the legislative actions of their representatives, who are listening to other voices. I referred above toformalpublic participation. The public can and should participate in other ways because the effectiveness of public activism has always been evident. Examples are legion, but most recently the young people involved in the Sunrise Movement succeeded in placing a Green New Deal program on the policy agenda. Such a policy\u2014perhaps modified in such a way as economist Robert Pollin has suggested\u2014is a necessity for survival. Steps towards a more democratic system are possible in many ways, but they will always be limited so long as economic power is highly concentrated, basic decision-making is in the hands of huge private tyrannies with little public accountability, and much of the population is living near the edge of financial disaster."

Global warming\u2014euphemistically called \u201cclimate change\u201d\u2014is the most urgent problem ever faced in human history, with the possible exception of nuclear war. Yet only a quarter of Republicans regard it as an urgent problem. On issues that are important for voting, conservative Republicans rank global warming last, well below such cosmic threats as Russian interference in U.S. elections. These are startling and frightening results. \u2018Since Washington so declares, Iran is labeled the greatest threat to peace\u2014in contrast to global opinion which, according to the Gallup polling organization, confers that honor on the United States.\u2019 Major energy players have dedicated great efforts to downplaying the threat, which their own scientists informed them was real and dire, and for a long time, the media barely covered the impending disaster, with portrayals giving equal emphasis to \u201cboth sides.\u201d The dramatic actions of such groups as Extinction Rebellion, Sunrise Movement, and School Strike for Climate are of great value in opening minds\u2014but those minds have to be engaged in unremitting action to implement changes on the ground, to pass legislation, to educate and organize. The task is particularly critical in the United States, not only because of its incomparable power and global influence, but also because under Republican rule it has become the global arch-criminal. Other countries are doing at least something to mitigate the threat, while the most powerful state in world history is vigorously fanning the flames, led by a narcissistic megalomaniac\u2014and consummate political demagogue\u2014who knows exactly what he is doing. Donald Trump appealed to the government of Ireland for a permit to build a wall (he loves walls) to protect his golf course from the anticipated sea level rise. Under the Trump bureaucracy, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released one of the most amazing documents in history\u2014and this is not hyperbole. A detailed environmental impact study, it assumes a 4-degree Celsius rise in temperature by 2100, which would mean the end for organized human life in anything like the forms we know. The argument it makes is in opposition to emission standards for vehicles since we\u2019re going off the cliff pretty soon anyways so why bother? Never mind that transportation is only \u201cthe largest source of global warming emissions in the United States,\u201d according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. Can one find words for this?

Do you think the same narrowness limits our understanding of our ongoing conflicts in the Middle East?",
    "output": "The Vietnam War was unprovoked imperial aggression. Bernard Fall, the highly respected and bitterly anti-Communist military historian and Indochina specialist, wrote in 1967 (with still worse to come) that \u201cVietnam as a cultural and historic entity . . . is threatened with extinction . . . [as] the countryside literally dies under the blows of the largest military machine ever unleashed on an area of this size.\u201d Scholarship and other commentary are deeply flawed unless this basic framework is adopted for analysis and discussion\u2014a minimal standard that is rarely met in discussion of the acts of one\u2019s own state and its allies and clients. The same concerns are very much alive, not least with regard to the Middle East, though there have been some salutary changes. The days are past when much of conventional media fare depicted Israel as \u201ca society in which moral sensitivity is a principle of political life\u201d (New York Timesopinion piece) and whose army is \u201canimated by the high moral purpose that has guided Israel throughout its tumultuous history\u201d (Time). Both quotes were from pieces that appeared immediately after the Sabra-Shatila massacre\u2014a massacre that was the coda to Israel\u2019s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, another crime of aggression without credible pretext. \u2018For the United States, defiance of international law is not an occasional departure from principle but is principle itself.\u2019 It will be instructive to see whether scholarship and other commentary can depart from today\u2019s norm regarding the U.S. assault against Iran. Stuxnet, for example, was a highly praised cyber attack on Iran that was largely believed to be a joint mission between the United States and Israel. Yet the Pentagon itself defines cyber attacks as acts of war that justify military response. More recently, the current, extremely harsh sanctions against Iran are supposed to punish the country for living up to the terms of the international nuclear agreement (JCPOA) that the United States alone has chosen to undermine. While the international community fumes, it is too intimidated to defy the global Godfather. Commentary often reflexively parrots the U.S. government propaganda line, sometimes with timid qualifications. Since Washington so declares, Iran is labeled the greatest threat to peace\u2014in contrast to global opinion which, according to the Gallup polling organization, confers that honor on the United States. Iran must cease to \u201cdestabilize\u201d the Middle East and learn to behave like a \u201cnormal nation\u201d (Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s mantra, repeated by many others). \u201cnormal\u201d nation is one like the leading U.S. allies in the region, those peace-loving nations and scrupulous defenders of human rights such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt\u2019s military dictatorship, and Israel. Or like Iran itself when it was under the rule of the U.S.-imposed dictator, the Shah, who was quite openly seeking to develop nuclear weapons with unremitting U.S. support while compiling one of the worst human rights records in the world according to Amnesty International. At the time, President Carter\u2014one of the lesser U.S. enthusiasts of the Shah\u2014lauded the Shah\u2019s \u201cgreat leadership\u201d in creating \u201can island of stability in one of the more troubled areas of the world.\u201d The Shah was basking, according to Carter, in \u201cthe respect and the admiration and love which your people give to you\u201d\u2014just months before he was overthrown by a popular uprising. But no accusations of destabilization then, as the Shah\u2019s Iran joined the Saudi dictatorship and Israel as the pillars of U.S. control over what Eisenhower had called the most \u201cstrategically important part of the world.\u201d It would be all too easy to continue."

    "input": "SC:It is a consistent theme in your writing that Democrats do not hold the moral high-ground over Republicans when it comes to foreign policy. What principles should guide our thinking when we try to formulate a truly progressive approach to foreign affairs?",
    "output": "It\u2019s useful, I think, to begin by imagining a conservative approach to foreign affairs. Such an approach would recognize that we have a Constitution, revered as a sacred text. It includes Article VI, which states that \u201call Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land.\u201d One such Treaty, of unusual contemporary significance, is the United Nations Charter, the foundation of modern international law. Article 2(4) of the Charter forbids \u201cthe threat or use of force\u201d in international affairs, with qualifications that we can put aside in the present context. I recognize that there is a respected profession which assures us that these words don\u2019t mean what they say, but I\u2019ll naively assume that they do. conservative approach would be to observe that the supreme law of the land is routinely violated by high officials, including the current president and his predecessor, who declare regularly that \u201call options are on the table\u201d with regard to Iran, and who not only threaten but resort to force, including such textbook examples of aggression as the invasion of Iraq without credible pretext. Illustrations are too numerous and familiar to mention, as are violations of the OAS Charter ban on any form of intervention \u201cin the affairs of another state.\u201d For the United States, defiance of international law is not an occasional departure from principle but is principle itself. The United States proudly adopts the stance of a rogue state that is immune to international law (including valid treaties that are the supreme law of the land). U.S. behavior is instead based on the principle enunciated by the respected statesman Dean Acheson, who instructed the American Society of International Law that no \u201clegal issue\u201d arises when the United States responds to a challenge to its \u201cpower, position, and prestige.\u201d \u2018We have two choices: to abandon hope and help ensure that the worst will happen; or to make use of the opportunities that exist and perhaps contribute to a better world. It is not a very difficult choice.\u2019 Thus, Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration was acting on principle when it rejected World Court jurisdiction over its attack against Nicaragua, dismissed the Court order that it terminate its crimes and pay substantial reparations, and then vetoed a Security Council resolution that affirmed the Court judgment and called on all states to observe international law. As State Department Legal Adviser Abraham Sofaer explained, most of the world cannot \u201cbe counted on to share our view [and the] majority often opposes the United States on important international questions\u201d so that we must \u201creserve to ourselves the power to determine\u201d how we will act and which matters fall \u201cessentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States, as determined by the United States\u201d\u2014in this case, the actions that the Court condemned as the \u201cunlawful use of force\u201d against Nicaragua, aka international terrorism. Conservatives might combine abiding by U.S. law with \u201ca decent respect to the opinions of mankind,\u201d thus rejecting the bipartisan consensus that neither U.S. law nor global norms apply to the United States, not merely defying ICJ rulings (in splendid isolation; its former partners, Libya and Albania, having finally accepted them) but also the legislation that authorizes the president to use force to \u201crescue\u201d any American brought to the Hague and such actions as revoking the visa of the ICC chief prosecutor if she dares to investigate the actions of the United States and its clients. Assuming that the United States might become a law-abiding state, it might move on to constructive measures, which readily come to mind. Those would include rejoining the world on confronting the truly existential threats to survival: environmental catastrophe and nuclear war. Or consider the crisis that ranks high among concerns of Americans (and highest among conservative Republicans): securing the southern border. A progressive policy would not only adhere to our international obligations on refugee asylum, but would go on to recognize our responsibility for creating the conditions from which miserable refugees are fleeing and to devote resources (\u201creparations,\u201d if we were honest) to overcoming the bitter conditions that are the occasion for their flight. It\u2019s easy to move on to truly progressive policies, but there\u2019s a long way to go before we can even get that far."

How would you evaluate the general role of corporate media in relation to that crisis? Do the kind of filters identified in your and Ed Herman\u2019s propaganda model of the media help to explain corporate media\u2019s shortcomings on global warming, or do other factors make global warming an especially difficult issue for journalism?",
    "output": "Take a standard story. There are reports on what\u2019s happening. So, if you look at theNew York Timestoday, for example, there\u2019s a pretty good article on the new discoveries on the melting of the polar ice caps which happens to be, as usual, more drastic than the (earlier) estimates; that\u2019s been typical for a long time. And it discusses the probable impact on sea level rise, albeit conservatively, given how dramatic it has obviously been. So, there are regular articles that appear \u2014 it\u2019s not that global warming is ignored. On the other hand, if you look at a standard article on oil exploration, theNew York Timescan have a big front page article on how the U.S. is moving towards what they call energy independence, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia in fossil fuel production, opening up new areas, Wyoming, the Midwest, for fracking. They do a long article, maybe 1,000 words \u2014 I have one particular example in mind \u2014 it will mention environmental consequences, it may harm the local water resources for ranchers, but literally not a word on the effect on global warming. And that happens in article after article in every outlet \u2014 theFinancial Times, theNew York Times, all the major newspapers. So, it\u2019s as if on the one hand, there\u2019s a kind of a tunnel vision \u2014 the science reporters are occasionally saying look, \u2018this is a catastrophe,\u2019 but then the regular coverage simply disregards it, and says, \u2018well, isn\u2019t this wonderful, we won\u2019t have to import oil, we\u2019ll be more powerful,\u2019 and so on."

Take the hearings, just a couple of days ago, for the new head of the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, who is a guy with a background in the coal industry. A senator asked him, \u2018What do you think about global warming?\u2019 He says, \u2018Yes it\u2019s probably taking place, humans are probably involved.\u2019 And he was asked, \u2018How urgent do you think it is?\u2019 And his answer was, \u2018It\u2019s probably eighth or ninth in the level of urgency, so it\u2019s something out there.\u2019 And the effect is that nothing is being done."

They don\u2019t care what kind of growth, it just has to grow. And that\u2019s just kind of internalized. So, yes, the advertisers have an effect, and the fact they are a corporation has an effect. But deeper than that, is a point that George Orwell made, one which I think is underestimated (and which we didn\u2019t actually discuss in ourManufacturing Consentbook). I don\u2019t know if you ever read the introduction toAnimal Farm\u2014 probably not, because it was suppressed \u2014 but it came out after it was discovered in his papers about 30 years later, and it\u2019s kind of an interesting introduction. The book is addressed to the people of England and he says this book is, of course, a satire about the totalitarian enemy, but he says we shouldn\u2019t feel too self-righteous about it because \u2014 I\u2019m quoting now \u2014 in free England, ideas can be be suppressed without the use of force. Orwell gives some examples, and about two sentences of explanation. One is that the press is owned by wealthy men who have every interest in not wanting certain ideas to be expressed, but the other is just essentially a good education. You go on to the best schools, graduate from Oxford and Cambridge, and you just have instilled into you the understanding that there are certain things it wouldn\u2019t do to say \u2014 and you don\u2019t even think about it any more. It just becomes what Gramsci called \u201chegemonic common sense,\u201d you just don\u2019t talk about it. And that\u2019s a big factor, how these things simply become internalized. People who bring them up sound like crazies."

Take Arizona here, you drive around here, the sun is shining all the time, most of the year; take a look and see how many solar panels you see. Our house in the suburbs is the only one that has them nearby. People are complaining that they have a thousand dollar electric bill per month over the summer for air conditioning but won\u2019t put up a solar panel; and in fact the Tucson electric company makes it hard to do.

It\u2019s basically two things, nuclear war and global warming, both of which are increasingly dire. But there\u2019s more. Take the threat of a pandemic. Industrial meat production is first of all inhumane, but secondly, it\u2019s a major contributor to global warming; and it\u2019s also destroying the effectiveness of antibiotics. They have wild overuse of antibiotics, and it\u2019s creating mutant bacteria that are resistant to any antibiotics, showing up in hospitals that could lead to a huge pandemic, like the flu pandemic a century ago which killed tens of millions of people. People talk about a migrant crisis, what\u2019s it going to be like when Bangladesh is flooded, hundreds of millions of people have to flee? South Asia is running out of water, already there are hundreds of millions of people that barely have water; with the glaciers melting and so on, they may lose their water supply. What happens to the world then? It\u2019s just going to be colossal problems. They\u2019re not far off."

    "output": "One way would be for them tobecomedemocratic societies. They\u2019re very far from it. Take elections \u2014 there\u2019s very convincing work in mainstream political science which shows that elections in the United States are basically bought. You can predict the outcome of an election for Congress or Executive with remarkable precision just by looking at the single variable of campaign spending. That\u2019s why when somebody\u2019s elected to the House of Representatives, the first day in office, she or he has to start gaining donor support for the next election. Meanwhile, legislation is being written by the staff with the lobbyists from the corporations, who are actually often just writing the legislation. It\u2019s a kind of democracy, but a very limited one. Do you see a possibility for media reform apart from broader social and political transformations? Because there is a movement, as you know, specifically for media reform, with Robert McChesney and many others. There\u2019s lots that can be done. The system has to be significantly modified in many ways, even radically modified. Media reform is one of them. Bob McChesney\u2019s important work is a model. There are things that can be done. The increased monopolization of the major media is a serious matter, as you know well, but if you look at Ben Bagdikian\u2019s book on the media monopoly back around 1980, there were maybe 50 sources of news, now it\u2019s down to half a dozen. The advertising-profit model for media has just undermined journalism. You go back to the early days even of the United States \u2014 the government recognized the significance of having a free and independent press, and simply subsidized things like free postal rates, which were devices to try to create an independent press. I just recently read a very interesting book,The Framers\u2019 Coupby Michael Klarman. It\u2019s now the gold standard on the formation of the constitution; it goes into tremendous detail on the discussions that were going on, and they\u2019re pretty impressive. There was a pamphlet literature, there was an independent press literature, people were contributing and farmers and craftsmen and everybody getting their two cents in, a model of discussion. Back in the mid-19thcentury, there was a very lively labour and ethnic press which was doing very interesting things. It pretty much collapsed under the concentration of capital and the advertising model, and the same in England, though in England it lasted even longer, until the 1960s."

    "output": "There\u2019s hope, but social media have been very much a two-edged sword. They are clearly creating a kind of echo chamber, a bubble system. We all do it, people gravitate to the things you believe in and don\u2019t hear other views \u2014 your own just get reinforced. It\u2019s leading to almost an impossibility of interaction. Some of this is pretty shocking. I was reading some statistics recently, and it turns out according to some recent polls, that the number of Americans who use the major media as their prime information source is single digits, it\u2019s about six per cent. Most of them are going to social media which don\u2019t produce the news, they filter it, they don\u2019t have reporters out in the field. And then of course you have innovations like talk radio and Fox, which are new. They are just really vicious propaganda systems, barely pretending to be anything else. That\u2019s the dark side. The good side is that (social media is) the way organizing goes on. That\u2019s the way you reach out to people, get together, and it\u2019s a very effective tool. Practically all organizing works this way. I mean even teaching, teachers often communicate with the students through social media. That\u2019s all anybody is doing. If you walk around campus, everybody\u2019s (on a device). One university, I think Duke University, started putting on the pavements things that say, Look up!, because they\u2019re all walking around looking down. Definitely what the effects are is hard to say. You see teenage kids sitting in a McDonalds, let\u2019s say, sitting around a table and there are two conversations going on \u2014 one in the group, and one that each person is having with whoever\u2019s talking to them on their phone. It just breaks down meaningful social relations. It could perhaps be a potential resource, at least \u2014 alternative media using the internet for climate communication. Blogs, Truthout, Truthdig, Common Dreams, Democracy Now, many others, are producing all kinds of information which you can\u2019t get on television. So it\u2019s potentially extraordinarily useful, but it has this negative aspect which is being pressed hard by the Silicon Valley giants on the advertising model, so it\u2019s being forced on you all the time. You search for something on Google and you\u2019re inundated by things you\u2019re supposed to want, and that\u2019s the impact of the big advertisers."

So, things like subsidizing independent media which is not a utopian idea, it was done in the United States in its early days; or the kinds of grassroots media movements that, say, Bob McChesney and others are pressing to develop. And it\u2019s an urgent requirement. I start my classes these last couple of years by simply pointing out to the students that they have to make a choice that no one in human history has ever made. They have to decide whether organized human society is going to survive. Even when the Nazis were on the rampage, you didn\u2019t have to face that question. Now you do."

The Extinction Rebellion from England has moved here, trying to do the same thing. But these dramatic actions, like demonstrations generally, they\u2019re not of any effect if they\u2019re isolated events. They have to be a stimulus for the constant organizing and education that has to go on day-to-day. And again, just take what we talked about before \u2014 Tucson, solar panels. People have to come to understand that they\u2019ve just got to do this, and fast; and it doesn\u2019t harm them, it improves their lives. For example, it even saves money. But just the psychological barrier that says that I can\u2019t look at this, that I have to keep to the common beliefs, and that this is somehow a radical thing that we have to be scared of, is a block that has to be overcome by constant educational organizational activity. The way every other popular movement developed \u2014 the civil rights movement, the antiwar movement, the feminist movement \u2014 just constant, often very small groups, growing into bigger groups for activism. Occasionally they have a dramatic action like a demonstration, but mainly to stimulate ongoing activity. And it can\u2019t be delayed."

    "output": "Ed wrote the basic framework, the institutional analysis, the corporate structure, the relations to government programs and the fundamental institutional structure of the media\u2014that was basically him. He also did parts on some of the specific studies, like on the coverage comparison of a hundred religious martyrs in Latin America with one Polish priest. He did the comparison of the elections, which was partly drawn from a book that he had already done on demonstration elections. I did all the parts on Vietnam and on the Freedom House attack on the media. Of course, we interacted on all the chapters, but the main division of labor was that. The reaction was quite interesting. Mostly the journalists and the media did not like it at all, of course. And, interestingly, they did not like the defense of the integrity of journalism: the last part, which investigated Peter Braestrup\u2019s major, two-volume Freedom House attack on the media for having been treacherous, for having lost the Vietnam war, and so on (which turned out to be a total fraud). I was probably the only person who read the actual document, both of the two volumes. One, the attack on the media, [the other] the documentary basis. Hardly any correlation between them! It was just literally total fraud! And what the results showed was that the journalists were courageous, honorable; they had integrity, they did their work seriously\u2014but, of course, all within the framework of US government ideology. Like all the coverage of the war, like, say, David Halberstam. It was honest, serious, but, almost without exception, within the framework of the assumption that the United States is making a mistake by trying to save democracy in South Vietnam from Communist aggression. That is the picture. The idea that the United States was carrying out a major war crime by invading another country and destroying the indigenous resistance.... the facts were there, but not the framework of discussion. And they did not like that. Journalists would much prefer to be regarded as aggressive, independent, thinking for themselves, and if they were treacherous, well, OK, maybe they went overboard attacking the US government\u2014that they much preferred. So as far as the journalists themselves were concerned, aside from a few exceptions, they did not like that picture of journalism as being honest, courageous and with integrity. There were very few reviews of the book, but there was one critical discussion that I wrote about later, by Nicholas Lehmann [New Republic, 1/9/89], a well-known scholar of journalism, who wrote a review in which he disparaged it, saying, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d For example, he discussed the chapter comparing the assassinations of a hundred religious martyrs in Central America, including an archbishop, American nuns and leading Latin American intellectuals\u2014where there was virtually no coverage\u2014with the coverage of the assassination of one Polish priest, where the assassins were immediately apprehended, tried, sentenced to jail\u2014where there was vast reportage. This was one of our many examples of the way in which \u201cworthy victims\u201d are treated, as compared with \u201cunworthy victims.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, this doesn\u2019t mean anything, it is just because the media focused on one thing at a time, and they happened to be focusing on Poland, not El Salvador.\u201d So, out of curiosity, I went to theNew York Timesindex, and it turned out there was more coverage of El Salvador than of Poland during that period. But it does not matter, because this is a world ofalternative facts. The media commentary is mostly propaganda and ideology. There were a few other critiques rather like that...but in the mainstream, it was basically ignored. The first book that Ed and I wrote together,Counterrevolutionary Violence, was published by a small publisher that was doing quite well. They published 20,000 copies of it, and were ready to distribute it. The publisher was owned by a big conglomerate,Warner Brothers, now part ofTime Warner. One of theWarnerexecutives saw the advertising for the book, and did not like it. He asked to see the book, and when he saw it, he went berserk and ordered them to stop distributing it immediately. The publisher at first did not agree. They said they would publish a critical volume with contrary views, but that was not enough. To prevent it from being published, in the course of the discussion, he just put the whole publisher out of business, destroying all their stock\u2014not only our book, but all their books. We brought this to the attention to some civil libertarians at the American Civil Liberties Union. They did not see any problem. It is not government censorship; it is just a corporation deciding to destroy a publisher to prevent them distributing a book. We immediately started working on an expansion of the book:The Political Economy of Human Rights. The reaction to that was quite interesting. Many things were discussed, but there were two major chapters where we compared two huge atrocities going on at the same time in the same place, in South East Asia: one in Cambodia under Pol Pot; the other in East Timor, after the Indonesian invasion. They were very similar. Per capita, the East Timor atrocities were worse, as they killed a larger portion of the population; but they were comparable. The fundamental difference between them was that in one case, you could blame it on an official enemy and there was absolutely nothing to do about it\u2014nobody had a proposal as to how to stop it. In the other case, we were responsible. The United States and its allies were crucially responsible. The US blocked action at the United Nations, provided the arms for Indonesia. The more the atrocities increased, the more the arms flowed. And there was everything you could do about it: You could just call it off. The reaction was, not a word on our chapter about East Timor; that disappeared. But there was a huge attack on our discussion of Cambodia. There was a huge literature on this, trying to show that we were apologists for Pol Pot. The reason for this was that we went through the media and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the facts are, we can\u2019t know, but we will compare the facts available with what came out of the media filter,\u201d and it was grotesque: There was lying at a level that would have astonished Stalin. So we went through that record. That led to total hysteria. Look it up, you will find a ton of literature about it. We recently published a new edition of the book, and we didn\u2019t change a comma, because there was nothing wrong with it. But that is the kind of reaction you get withManufacturing Consent."

The news that appears in social media is drawn from them. So, if you look at the news onFacebook, it comes straight from the major media. They don\u2019t do their own investigations. As far as the major media are concerned, there is no fundamental difference. In fact, in some ways, they are a little more independent than they were back in the 1980s, partly because of changes in the society, which have opened things up to an extent. But fundamentally, they are the same. In fact, Ed and I did a second edition ofManufacturing Consentabout 16 years ago, and we talked about the internet and whether to write anything about it, and we decided just to leave it alone. As far as social media are concerned, they are interesting in themselves. There has been a certain amount of study of them. What they have done is create bubbles. If you read theNew York Times\u2014which, incidentally, young people did not read much in the 1980s, either\u2014but if you read theNew York Timesor theWashington Post, or even if you watch television news, you get a certain range of opinion, not very broad\u2014it goes from center to far-right, but at least there is some discussion, and occasionally you get a critical voice here and there. On social media, that has declined. People tend to go to things that just reinforce their own opinions, so you end up with bubbles. And it is all across the spectrum. The people on what is called the left see the left media, the people on the right see the right media. And the level of material is, of course, much more shallow. The mainstream media, as we wrote inManufacturing Consent, are a very significant source of news and information, and provide very valuable material. The first thing I do every day is read theNew York Times, as it is the most comprehensive journal. You have to critically analyze what you read and understand the framework, what is left out and so forth, but that is not quantum physics; it is not hard to do. But it is a source of news. On social media, you do not find that. There are exceptions; there are internet journals that are very good\u2014for example,The Intercept\u2014but most of it [internet and social media] is pretty shallow, and has led to a decline in understanding of the world in many ways. AM:And, of course, there is the increasingly close relationship between these massive online monopolies and the US state. For instance, Jeff Bezos, the owner of theWashington PostandAmazon, received a $600 million contract with the CIA. Meanwhile,Googlehas something of a revolving door with the State Department, and shares enormous amounts of data about us with it, and are constantly listening to us through products like Siri and Alexa. Its former CEO, Eric Schmidt\u2019s book about technological imperialism came heartily endorsed by Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Tony Blair\u2014and the former head of the NSA, who calledGooglepart of the \u201cdefense industrial base.\u201d Julian Assange has called some ofGoogle\u2019s projects \u201cOrwellian horrors.\u201d To a certain extent, that is true. They do things that are connected with state power, but I thinkGoogleandFacebookand the other few conglomerates that monopolize the system are basically connected with advertisers. They are part of the business world. So they are essentially selling you to advertisers, just as the major old media do; they are also selling audiences to advertisers, but in a different way.GoogleandFacebookare doing it by monitoring everything about you, so that somehow advertisers will be able to make more money approaching you. And that is very dangerous. And some of the things that are done and are not reported are quite interesting. So take the last German elections, for example. There was a lot of talk about potential Russian interference, that the Russians would undermine the election and so on. It turns out therewasinterference in the election. It was not Russian. It was from the United States. A media company that works for nice guys like Trump, Le Pen and Netanyahu got together withFacebook, and theFacebookoffice of Berlin provided them with extensive details of the kind they have on German voters, so then the media company could microtarget ads to specific voters to try to influence them to vote in a certain way. For whom? For Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, the neo-fascist party! Which probably is a factor in their surprisingly high vote. This was reported in the business press, so you can read about it inBloomberg Businessweek. But try to find a report in the mainstream press. It is not the kind of electoral manipulation we like to talk about. That is typical of the kind of things we discussed inManufacturing Consent. So, yes, there is interference in elections, this is a good example. But the main thing is the way in which people are individually tracked to monitor the environment in which they live, so as to control them for the benefit of advertisers and business. You may have read that there are recent studies showing that automobile manufacturers are now so flooded with data from drivers of cars, that they have not yet worked out a way on how to get a business model, to allow advertisers to follow you every moment of your life. There are already apps that you can get where they give you some free device, and in return you agree to have advertisements posted on the car dashboard the whole time you are driving. So if you are approaching an area where there is a certain restaurant, there will be an ad for that restaurant, things like that. This is really insidious, and it can be used in very dangerous ways, and sooner or later will be, I am sure."

Another would be Jeremy Corbyn. [Note: The day after this interview took place, theSun, Britain\u2019s largest newspaper by circulation, ran with the front-page headline, \u201cPutin\u2019s Puppet: Corbyn Refuses to Blast Russia on Spy Attack,\u201d as the leader of the Labour Party did not unreservedly endorse sanctions on Russia.] What is your opinion about the #Russiagate allegations, and the general political climate with regards to Russia?",
    "output": "As you probably know, in the United Kingdom right now, there are moves to remove people\u2019s access toRT, which is another television outlet. When I am overseas, I look at that andBBC, and they give a lot of information and news from different perspectives. But you have to protect people in the UK from an alternative point of view. In the United States, it is not a problem, because practically nobody has heard ofRT. AndAl-Jazeera, for example, had to cancel its efforts to reach an American audience, because practically no station would allow them to appear. So there is no state censorship, it is justCounterrevolutionary Violencebusiness censorship again. Let\u2019s take the Russia business. Let\u2019s say all the claims are true. Suppose Russia tried to interfere in the American elections. That ought to make people laugh hysterically. There ishugeinterference in American elections. It comes from the corporate sector. They practically buy the elections. In fact, there is extensive work in mainstream academic political science that demonstrates very convincingly that you can predict the electability, hence largely the votes, of people in Congress on major issues just by looking at their campaign funding. That is one factor, let alone lobbying and everything else. That ismassiveinterference in elections. About 70 per cent of the population of the US is not even represented, meaning that their own representatives pay no attention to their views, and follow the views of the major funders. This is manipulation on an enormous level! Whatever the Russians might have done is not even a toothpick on a mountain compared to that, quite apart from the fact that the US not only intervenes in elections (including in Russia), but overthrows governments. The whole thing is a bad joke, and a sign of the collapse of the Democratic Party as a serious institution. They are focusing on this marginal phenomenon as a way to discredit Trump, and almost totally ignoring the really devastating things carried out by the Trump administration. Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting did a study a little while ago of interviews with Trump by the major media since his election. It turns out that climate change was not mentioned. That is the most serious thing that he is doing! It should be a major headline every day that, alone in the world, the most powerful country in human history is not only refusing to participate in the efforts to deal with an existential crisis, but, in fact, is acting to exacerbate the crisis, pouring funds and money into more use of fossil fuels. Try and find an example in history of any political organization that was dedicated with passion to trying to destroy the prospect for organized human life. Even the Nazis were not doing that! And that is the Republican Party under Trump. It is the most dangerous organization in human history, for this reason alone. It is not asked about, not discussed. It is hard to find words to describe it. Instead of that, and plenty of other things that they are doing, what the media is trying to do is find some Russian interference in the election. It is hard to know what to say about it!"

Even organizations that do not rely on the traditional financing structure, like theBBC, have told their staff to \u201cemulateBuzzfeed.\u201d What is your opinion on fake news today, its uses and abuses?",
    "output": "The use of just invented news\u2014Breitbart, for example\u2014is not new, but it used to be on supermarket shelves. You would see theNational Enquirer, that would tell you Obama had an affair with whomever. That is fake news. But now it has spread quite widely, but not really in the major media. I think they do pretty much what they did before. It is true that advertising revenues had declined for a time, but they increased with Trump. The television media in particular are delighted with the Trump phenomenon\u2014you cannot turn on the television set without seeing something about Trump. And it is bringing in many more viewers. One of the CEOs ofCBSsaid during the presidential campaign that \u201cfor us, economically, Trump\u2019s place in this election is a good thing,\u201d that he has \u201cnever seen anything like it\u201d and it is \u201cgoing to be a very good year for us.\u201d I happened to be overseas when the election took place, and I watchedBBCfor several days. It was 100 percent Trump! Nothing else in the world! Actually, the election was important, but it was important for quite different reasons that were not reported. For example, November 8, the day of the election, was an extremely important day in history. The World Meteorological Organization was meeting in Morocco and trying to put some teeth in the Paris negotiations. It had presented a dire picture of the impact of climate change on the world. As soon as the election results came in, the meeting basically stopped, and the question was, \u201cCan we even continue when the most powerful country in human history is deciding to destroy our efforts?\u201d That was the major news of the day, not the fact that some half-mad billionaire with huge media support managed to win an election. But it was not even mentioned. A couple of weeks later, I found some mentions in the back pages. As far as the election itself was concerned, the most striking feature was the Sanders campaign. The Sanders campaign was the first time in over a century of American political history that a candidate was able to get to where he did. Sanders probably would have been nominated if it had not been for the machinations of the Obama/Clinton party managers. But he did this with no name recognition, no funding from wealth or corporate power, and no media support or recognition\u2014that is astonishing! That has never happened in American political history. In the United States, elections are basically bought, as I mentioned previously. This was a really striking phenomenon, but was barely mentioned in the media. By now, he is by far the most popular political figure in the country, but you hardly see a mention of him anywhere. He and his movement are doing lots of things, but they cannot get any reporting on it. Those are the really important things. And theBBCis the same; it is \u201cTrump did this,\u201d \u201cTrump did that.\u201d What Trump actuallyisdoing is pretty clever. It is a dual program underway; Trump carries out one ridiculous antic after another. The media focus on it, the factcheckers start, and a couple of days later they say, \u201cWell, this and that fact were wrong,\u201d but by then, everyone has forgotten about it, and he is on to some new antics. Meanwhile, while media attention is focused on the megalomaniac conman who is working to attract their attention, the really savage wing of the Republican Party, the Paul Ryan wing, is busy dismantling every element of government that might help the general population, and dedicating themselves to theirrealconstituency: the super wealthy and corporate power. That is happening in the background, while everyone is focusing on Trump\u2019s latest antics. It is a good system and is working very well. Meanwhile, he is maintaining his base, who are under the illusion that somehow he is going to bring back jobs or that he is standing up for America. It is working quite well, and the media and the Democrats are in particular responsible for allowing it to continue."

Furthermore, journalism appears to be becoming a less professionalized field, with fewer and fewer full-time staff journalists employed by newspapers and TV, and more freelancers and citizen journalists. In this context, what is journalism\u2019s future?",
    "output": "Media coverage is shrinking, but the part that is there is still professionalized. There are very good, professional correspondents in the field, analysts and so on, but there are much fewer of them. Take Boston, where I have lived for many years. TheBoston Globewas a major, leading newspaper. It had international bureaus; it did the best coverage of Central America during Reagan\u2019s wars. Now there are a few things apart from local news in it, and the rest is what they pick up from wire services. It is essentially hardly a newspaper anymore. That kind of thing is happening around the country, but it is not deprofessionalization, it is just a decline in the model of the media that had functioned. In part, it is being undermined by social media. If people can turn on the computer and get a couple of headlines, then go on with their lives, it is a lot easier than reading a newspaper and trying to figure out what is happening. So there is a general cheapening of the culture that is affecting the media. But I see no evidence that the media are more influenced in their news coverage and analysis by advertisers than was the case before. It may be so, but I do not have any evidence for it."

We looked at the institutional structures of the [mainstream] media. What are they? They are major corporations, that are often parts of bigger, mega-corporations. They have a product that they sell to a market. The product is readers of newspapers, or viewers on television, and the market is advertisers. So they are corporate institutions that sell readers to advertisers. They are all closely linked to government. There is a lot of flow, in and out, of personnel, with a lot of influence. And we asked a simple question, that anyone who believes in free markets would ask at once: Do the structure of the producer, of the market, and the links to other power structures, does that affect the media content?

There is a lot of concern about the potential threat of Iranian nuclear weapons. A couple of questions arise: Suppose Iran was developing nuclear weapons. Who would be threatened?",
    "output": "Actually, we have an analysis of this, by a US intelligence report to Congress on the nature of the strategic issues of the world. This is before the P5+1 agreement. What they point out is that if Iran is developing nuclear weapons, which we do not know, the reason would be as part of theirdeterrentstrategy. As they point out, Iran has very low military expenditure, even by the standards of the region, and, of course, by the standards of the West. Their strategic doctrine is defensive; they want to defend themselves from any attack. And if they are developing nuclear weapons, it would be part of their deterrent strategy. Who is that a threat to? It is very simple: It is a threat to the rogue states that want to rampage in the region without any deterrent. There are two of them. They are called the United States and Israel. It is a threat to them if anyone has a deterrent. That is the potential \u201cthreat\u201d of Iran. Is there a way of dealing with that potential threat? There is one very simple way: move to establish a nuclear weapons\u2013free zone in the area. Is there a barrier to that? Not from Iran. Iran has been calling for that for years. Not the Arab states, they have been pressing for it almost forever. In fact, they initiated the effort. Not the rest of the world, which is strongly in favor of it. There is one barrier. It is called the United States. The US, over a long period of time, has refused to allow this to proceed, most recently Obama in 2015. The US and Britain have a special commitment to this. Here is what ought to be the headlines on Iran: The United States and Britain have a particular commitment to a nuclear weapons\u2013free zone in the region. When the US and Britain invaded Iraq, they had to concoct some sort of pretext. What they did was refer to a 1991 Security Council resolution that called on Saddam Hussein to stop his production of weapons of mass destruction. That very same Security Council resolution calls on \u201call parties,\u201d meaning the US and Britain, to move towards establishing a nuclear weapons\u2013free zone in the region. So the US and Britain have a special commitment to move towards the one measure that could end any possible threat that anyone believes Iran poses. Why aren\u2019t they doing it? There is a simple reason. They have to prevent any inspection or control of Israel\u2019s nuclear facilities. That is the story. Do you see it discussed? No. And I would give many other examples in a new edition."

However, in perhaps a rather unsurprising development, it looks like the obstructionist elements inside the Democratic Party will make sure that the U.S. remains a noticeable outlier among developed countries by not having a major social welfare state. Indeed, Joe Manchin, one of the Democratic senators standing in the way of the passage of the reconciliation bill, said that the U.S. should not turn into an \u201centitlement society.\u201d How do you assess all the drama in Congress around the $3.5 trillion in infrastructure, social programs and combatting the climate crisis, and what does this whole experience reveal to us about the state of U.S. politics in the post-Trump era?",
    "output": "It\u2019s not post-Trump, unfortunately. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s heavy hand has not been lifted. He owns the increasingly radicalized voting base of the Republican Party. The leadership slinks to his Mar-a-Lago palace to plead for his blessing, and the few who dare to raise their heads have them lopped off quickly. The right-wing Democrats (mislabeled \u201cmoderate\u201d) follow along for their own reasons. These are not hard to discern in some cases: It\u2019s not a great surprise that a coal baron who is Congress\u2019s leading recipient of fossil fuel funding (Manchin) should proclaim the fossil fuel industry\u2019s \u201cno elimination\u201d slogan, or that a top recipient of donations from the pharmaceutical industry (Sen. Kyrsten Sinema) should be holding back badly need drug pricing reforms. That\u2019s normal in a political system mired in corruption. But the rot runs deeper. It\u2019s often been observed that the U.S. has a one-party political system \u2014 the business party \u2014 with two factions, Democrats and Republicans. In the past, the Republican faction has tended to be more dedicated to the concerns of extreme wealth and the corporate sector, but with the resurgence of the one-sided class war called \u201cneoliberalism\u201d under President Ronald Reagan, the leadership has been going off the rails. By now they barely resemble a political party in a functioning democracy. Since the late President Jimmy Carter years, the Democrats have not lagged far behind, becoming a party of affluent professionals and Wall Street donors with the working class handed over to their bitter class enemy. One of Trump\u2019s occasional true statements was that Republicans could never win a fair election on their actual programs. Recognizing this, since President Richard Nixon\u2019s Southern strategy, the party has been mobilizing voters on \u201ccultural issues\u201d \u2014 white supremacy, abortion, guns, traditional patriarchal families, God (favoring the evangelical Christian variety)... anything that doesn\u2019t lift the veil on their loyal service to their prime constituency. That way they can at least stay in the running, exploiting the deeply undemocratic features of the electoral system with its built-in advantages for their largely rural voting base. All this and much more has been extensively discussed elsewhere. We need not elaborate here. It\u2019s playing out in the halls of Congress right now. The extent to which the U.S. is an \u201coutlier\u201d glares at us wherever we look, sometimes in ways that verge on obscenity. Take paid maternity leave. In the U.S.: none. In the next largest country in the hemisphere, Brazil: about four months. That\u2019s in addition to the universal health care, free higher education, and other public benefits that are found almost everywhere. To be fair, the richest country in the world, with unparalleled advantages, is not alone in denying paid leave to new mothers. (Fathers? Forget about it.) The U.S. is joined by the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea and Tonga. Recently a lead columnist for the LondonFinancial Timesquipped that if Sen. Bernie Sanders was in Germany, he could be running on the right-wing Christian Democrat ticket. Not just a witticism, and not a comment on Sanders. Rather, on the socioeconomic system that has been created in the one-party state, dramatically so in the era of vicious class war since Reagan. It was not always thus. In the 1930s, while continental Europe succumbed to fascism, the U.S. forged a path toward social democracy on a wave of militant labor activism, lively and diverse politics, and a sympathetic administration. Years earlier, the U.S. had pioneered mass public education, a major contribution to democracy and social justice; Europe lagged far behind. It\u2019s beyond irony that now Europe is upholding a tattered social democracy while the U.S. declines to Trump-led proto-fascism, or that under Trump, the secretary of education sought to dismantle public education, carrying forward the neoliberal principles that underlie the sharp defunding of public education aimed at its elimination. All this is rooted in the \u201clibertarian\u201d doctrines of Milton Friedman, James Buchanan and other leading figures of the movement, closely linked from its origins to the attack against government \u201coverreach\u201d by desegregating schools. It\u2019s worth recalling that these doctrines had their origin in bitter class war in interwar Austria, as we\u2019ve discussed before. They are well-suited for its resumption in the neoliberal era. The Biden effort to move the U.S. somewhat toward the humane norms of other OECD countries is still not dead, but it has been virtually neutralized in Congress. The Republican organization is rock-solid opposed. Its red lines include preservation in full of their one legislative achievement under Trump, \u201cthe U.S. Donor Relief Act of 2017,\u201d as Joseph Stiglitz termed the wholesale robbery, which punched a huge hole in the deficit (for a \u201cgood\u201d cause, so OK). By charming coincidence this near-$2 trillion gift to the very rich and the corporate sector is about the same as the measly remnants of the Biden reconciliation bill (spread over 10 years) that have barely survived the right-wing assault. This time the \u201cdeficit threat\u201d is definitely not OK, as is loudly proclaimed. Not a good cause this time. Wrong recipients: the poor, workers, mothers and other \u201cunpeople.\u201d"

Rather, it means that it\u2019s not easy to answer. There are many imponderables, not least, how it will affect the coming elections. In earlier years, it was often not too important which faction of the business party took power. In recent years, it has been. Proto-fascism is on the march. Worse still, as we\u2019ve discussed elsewhere, we\u2019re are advancing to a precipice from which there will be no return. Four more years of Trumpism might well tip the balance. Which answer to the question you raise will reduce the likelihood of impending disasters? I don\u2019t see an easy answer. The question may by now be moot, with the vicious cuts in the reconciliation bill. Won\u2019t there be grave political consequences if Democrats blow the chance to reshape federal priorities? After all, the majority of U.S. people seem to be in support of Biden\u2019s Build Back Better Act. The Republicans have been pursuing a careful and well-thought-out policy of maintaining power as a minority party dedicated to great wealth and corporate power. It has been openly announced by the most malicious and politically powerful of the gang: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, repeating what worked well for his reactionary cause during the President Barack Obama years (helped by Obama\u2019s quick betrayal of those who believed the pretty rhetoric about \u201chope and change\u201d). So far, it\u2019s working. If it does work, with Trump and acolytes returning to power thanks to this malevolence, we will be well on our way to proto-fascism and to falling off the precipice. Failure of Biden\u2019s efforts to reshape federal priorities will have a terrible human cost. Beyond that, it will also provide a weapon for the McConnell strategy of harming the country as much as possible and blaming the outcome on the Democrats. Brutal, but not stupid. Is there a way to fend off these grave political consequences? Not within the confines of the deeply corrupt and undemocratic political system. The only way that has ever worked, and can work now, is mass popular pressure \u2014 what the powerful call \u201cthe peasants coming with their pitchforks.\u201d"

    "output": "We\u2019ve often discussed it before, and there has been extensive investigation by social scientists \u2014 most convincingly, in my opinion, by Tony DiMaggio. It\u2019s not just Trump, though he has shown real genius in tapping poisons that run deep in U.S. history and contemporary culture, and in portraying himself as \u201cyour savior\u201d \u2014 even \u201cthe chosen one\u201d \u2014 while stabbing you in the back. That\u2019s no small accomplishment for a person with few talents other than chicanery, fraud, and wielding the wrecking ball to destroy everything he can\u2019t claim as his own. But it\u2019s not just Trump. We can also ask why Nixon\u2019s racist Southern strategy succeeded, or Reagan\u2019s quite overt racism \u2014 in his case, apparently sincerely held. We can ask why the abortion and gun frauds took hold, or why in the face of overwhelming evidence, segments of the left join the far right in anti-vax campaigns, at enormous human costs, or why \u201cmore than half of President Trump\u2019s supporters [in 2020] embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory of a global satanic pedophile ring that was plotting against the 45th president of the United States,\u201d who was valiantly trying to save the children from such \u201cprominent pedophiles\u201d as Biden, Hillary Clinton, and other \u201cDeep State\u201d suspects. The signs of collapse of the social order are too numerous and familiar to review once again. To a large extent, it can be attributed to the impact of the one-sided and vicious class war of the past 40-plus years. There are deeper cultural and historical roots. It\u2019s not just the U.S. European racism and xenophobia is even more malevolent in some respects. One sign is the corpses in the Mediterranean, victims of the frenzy of Europe\u2019s dedication to torture the survivors of its centuries of destruction of Africa. The effort to reveal the roots of such pathologies is no mere academic enterprise, and not just these. We can add the pathologies of the rich and powerful, including the deplorables who hurl the epithet at others. These have been far more consequential. Efforts to understand are of value primarily as a guide to self-reflection and to action to find remedies. And quickly. Our strange species doesn\u2019t have a lot of time to spare."

    "input": "ROBINSON: You often discuss the fact that there are two twin existential threats to human civilization. There is the threat of climate catastrophe. And then there is the threat of nuclear weapons and global warfare. One of these gets discussed more than the other. We actuallyhad another Professor Chomsky on last weekto discuss the climate crisis\u2014Professor Aviva Chomsky, who discussed her bookIs Science Enough?Forty Critical Questions About Climate Justice.We talk a lot on this program about the climate crisis, but I want to talk about nuclear weapons and war. And I want to start in kind of an unusual way. I want to go back to 1945. I was reading Daniel Ellsberg recently. In his bookThe Doomsday Machine, he talks about how when he was in middle school, he was assigned a paper and his teacher told them that they were talking about the possibility of making a new kind of bomb that could destroy an entire city. He said his entire class wrote the paper about this bomb. And they all agreed that if such a thing came into existence, it would be so totally destructive for human civilization that it would need to be eliminated completely. And then, of course, a few years later, the bomb was in fact dropped. And so I want to start by taking you back to that time. You witnessed it\u2014the beginning of the era of the nuclear threat. Do you remember what it was like when you realized what had been done to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when you saw the opening of this terrible possibility, this change in the whole world?",
    "output": "CHOMSKY:I remember it very well. I was a junior counselor at a summer camp. In the morning, there was an announcement over the camp loudspeaker that an atom bomb had been used in Hiroshima and had destroyed the city. Everyone went on to their morning activity\u2014baseball games, swimming, whatever it was. I was so appalled. I couldn\u2019t believe it. First of all, nobody knew the details of what had happened but the general picture was clear. So, first of all, what had happened. Secondly, about the reaction. In fact, double terror. I was so appalled by it, I just left the camp, walked off into the woods by myself, sat there for a couple hours thinking about it. It was pretty clear that human intelligence and its glory had reached the point where it would soon be able to destroy all life on Earth. Not yet. I mean, the atom bomb had limited capacity. The bombing of Hiroshima in many ways was not worse than the firebombing of Tokyo a couple months earlier, and in scale probably didn\u2019t reach that level. But it was clear that the genie was out of the bottle, that modern technology and science would advance to the point where it would reach the capacity to destroy everything, so double terror. It did reach that point in 1953, with the explosion of thermonuclear weapons. My feeling at that time was,we\u2019re lost.I mean, if human intelligence is that far ahead of human moral capacity, the chance of closing that gap is slight, particularly witnessing the reaction just increasing in following days. Basically, nobody cared. ROBINSON: One of the deeply concerning features of American life is the disjunction between the reality of war on the ground and the way that Americans talk about it. When the news came out, the phrase \u201cdestroyed a city\u201d doesn\u2019t really convey what actually happened. But then the photos and testimonies start coming out, and we start to understand what it actually means. But for some reason, this knowledge\u2014this real sense of what war is like for those who actually experience it\u2014seems absent from the conversation. Today, for example, we can have these conversations in the abstract, and people think, for example, \u201cOh, yes, it\u2019d be a good idea to engage Russia militarily, maybe there\u2019sa bitof a nuclear risk,\u201d without really understanding the human reality of the situation."

My wife and I were graduate students. One evening, we decided to go to a film. So we looked through the movie ads, and surprisingly, we saw a film called Hiroshima. That was surprising. We lived in Boston, and the film was in an area called Scollay Square. It was the porn district. We never went there. But we figured we\u2019d go see this film. It was being shown as a pornographic film. The audience was laughing hysterically. It was a graphic film. I don\u2019t know where they got the live film. But it was a live film from Hiroshima: people running around with their skin peeling off\u2014hideous scenes\u2014and it was being shown as a pornographic film, while people were laughing. Can you even imagine that?",
    "output": "I mean, I can tell you from my own experience. When I was a kid, in the 1930s, my friends and I were running around in the woods, playing cowboys and Indians. We were the Cowboys, killing the Indians. Okay. I don\u2019t know if that was still true when you were my age. That\u2019s the history of the United States. The United States never gets attacked, not until 9/11. The last attack on American soil was the War of 1812. What we do is attack others. ROBINSON: And of course, we still hear that attitude of being blas\u00e9 or indifferent about war or being alright with the atrocities inflicted by our country on other countries. CHOMSKY:It goes on right to the present. Right at this moment, you hear heroic statements bypeople in Congressor foreign policy specialists sayingwe should set up a no-fly zone, for example, to defend Ukraine. Fortunately, there\u2019s one peacekeeping force in the government. It\u2019s called the Pentagon. They are so far vetoing the heroic statements by congressmen showing off for their constituents about how brave they are, pointing out that a no-fly zone not only means shooting down Russian planes, but it means attacking Russian anti-aircraft installations inside Russia. Then what happens? Well, actually, the latest polls showabout 35 percent of Americansare listening to the heroic speeches from Congress and advisors. Thirty-five percent say they think we should enter into the war in Ukraine, even if it threatens to lead to a nuclear war. The end of everything. The country that launches the first strike will be destroyed. ROBINSON: People are agitating for escalation. But there\u2019s also, of course, a very serious risk that any conflict between nuclear powers can escalate without either party consciously wanting it to, and that mistakes and errors can cause any kind of hot war between nuclear-armed powers to turn into a disaster. CHOMSKY:We should also understand something that the Pentagon at least understands very well. The Russians have plenty of nuclear weapons. But they have a very limited warning system. They use old-fashioned, long obsolete, radar-based warning. That means up to the horizon. The U.S. uses a satellite warning system. So if anything happens anywhere, on the ground, in Russia, we have instant knowledge of it. And Russia doesn\u2019t know anything until shortly before the attack hits, which means they\u2019re very prone to mistaking an accidental warning as an actual missile launch. And they don\u2019t have any time to prepare. This has come very close in the past. Inone famous caseduring the early Reagan years, the administration in its brilliance was simulating attacks on Russia to try to test Russian defenses, including simulating nuclear attacks. They assumed the Russians would understand that this is just for show. Well, it didn\u2019t quite work like that. The Russians thought maybe this is real. It was at a moment of high tension in international affairs, whenPershing missiles were being debated about being installed in Western Europe, which have a five to 10 minute flight time to Moscow, so they were nervous. And we came pretty close to a terminal nuclear war. It was stopped by a Russian [namedStanislav Petrov]; he was the officer in charge of monitoring the warning systems. And there was an automated warning saying a missile attack was coming. According to protocol, he was supposed to send this on to the higher-ups and they\u2019d have a couple of minutes to decide whether to launch a strike in time, but he decided not to. He just looked at it. And it seemed to him as though there was sufficient warning. So he didn\u2019t do it. He was later censured and punished for this. But he saved the world from destruction. That\u2019snot the only time. We all know we\u2019re toying with it. And as I say, over a third of Americans are reacting like the kids in my summer camp in 1945. Okay, who cares? Let\u2019s be heroic and go on and do it. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a moment as dangerous as this actually, during the nuclear age."

    "output": "CHOMSKY:I don\u2019t know if you saw it. But a couple of days ago, there was a very importantinterviewby one of the most astute and respected figures in current U.S. diplomatic circles, Ambassador Chas Freeman. A very important interview. He pointed out that the current U.S. policy, which he bitterly criticized, is to \u201cfight Russia to the last Ukrainian,\u201d and he gave us an example: President Biden\u2019s heroic statement about the war criminal Putin\u2014[Biden\u2019]s counterpart as a war criminal. And Freeman pointed out the obvious: the U.S. is setting things up so as to destroy Ukraine and to lead to a terminal war. In this world, there are two options with regard to Ukraine. As we know, one option is anegotiated settlement, which will offer Putin an escape, an ugly settlement. Is it within reach? We don\u2019t know; you can only find out by trying and we\u2019re refusing to try. But that\u2019s one option. The other option is to make it explicit and clear to Putin and the small circle of men around him that you have no escape, you\u2019re going to go to a war crimes trial no matter what you do. Boris Johnson justreiterated this: sanctions will go on no matter what you do. What does that mean? It means go ahead and obliterate Ukraine and go on to lay the basis for a terminal war. Those are the two options: and we\u2019re picking the second and praising ourselves for heroism and doing it: fighting Russia to the last Ukrainian. Sometimes this becomes\u2014I don\u2019t know if the word is comical or grotesque. A couple days ago\u2014I\u2019m sure you saw this\u2014Hillary Clintonsuggested thatwe pull the Brzezinski trick. [In 1998], Brzezinski, who was Carter\u2019s National Security Advisor,had an interview in France, in which he bragged about how they\u2019d drawn Russia into the war in Afghanistan [starting the1979-89 Soviet-Afghan war]. Whether he was just boasting or whether it was true, nobody knows, but it doesn\u2019t matter much. What he said is that as National Security Advisor before the Russian invasion, he had convinced Carter to send arms to an insurgency that was attacking the pro-Russian government in Afghanistan, figuring this would draw the Russians in. And then, the Russians\u2014in fact, as we now know definitively from released Russian archives\u2014recognized pretty quickly that they\u2019d made a mistake and wanted to get out. But the U.S., following Brzezinski in its brilliance\u2014this is Reagan now\u2014organized radical Islamist fanatics from all over the world, including Osama bin Laden, to carry out the fight to ensure that the Russians stayed in, killing maybe a million Afghans and wrecking the country. Brzezinski was asked about that by the interviewer. He said, Do you think this was worth doing? He said, Look, what\u2019s the fate of Afghans as compared with the importance of bringing down the global enemy? That\u2019s us. That\u2019s Hillary Clinton a couple of days ago, saying let\u2019s do that. Let\u2019s draw the Russians into Ukraine, fight a harsh guerrilla war, be really tough on them. It\u2019ll exhaust them, destroy them, we\u2019ll bring them down. Of course, on the side, Ukraine will be wiped out. Okay, that\u2019s us now, at the liberal end of spectrum. I\u2019m not talking about Josh Hawley, you know."

    "input": "ROBINSON: How do you respond, though, when someone says, look, it\u2019s an aggressive invasion? It\u2019s a crime of war. Yes, the United States might be hypocritical, but it is a war crime. The President of Ukraine has been essentially begging for the imposition of a no-fly zone or saying in the absence of that, give us more weapons. This is a battle for the sovereignty of Ukraine. And any resolution to the conflict that does give Putin an off-ramp is a form of appeasement that encourages further aggressive warfare in the future. How does one respond to an argument like that?",
    "output": "CHOMSKY:Well, I would not criticize Zelensky. He\u2019s acting with great courage, great integrity. You can understand and sympathize with his position from where he sits. However, the Pentagon has a wiser stand. Yes, we could enter the war. We could provide Zelensky with jet planes and advanced weapons. Pretty soon Putin would be radically escalating the attack on Ukraine, would wipe it out which he has the capacity to do. He would be attacking the supply chains that are providing advanced weapons. And we\u2019d be in a war, which would be a nuclear war, which would wipe us all out. So I\u2019m not criticizing Zelensky; he\u2019s an honorable person and has shown great courage. You can sympathize with his positions. But you can also pay attention to the reality of the world. And that\u2019s what it implies. I\u2019ll go back to what I said before: there are basically two options. One option is to pursue the policy we are now following, to quote Ambassador Freeman again, to fight Russia to the last Ukrainian. And yes, we can pursue that policy with the possibility of nuclear war. Or we can face the reality that the only alternative is a diplomatic settlement, which will be ugly\u2014it will give Putin and his narrow circle an escape hatch. It will say,Here\u2019s how you can get out without destroying Ukraine and going on to destroy the world. We know the basic framework is neutralization of Ukraine, some kind of accommodation for the Donbas region, with a high level of autonomy, maybe within some federal structure in Ukraine, and recognizing that, like it or not, Crimea is not on the table. You may not like it, you may not like the fact that there\u2019s a hurricane coming tomorrow, but you can\u2019t stop it by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like hurricanes,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t recognize hurricanes.\u201d That doesn\u2019t do any good. And the fact of the matter is, every rational analyst knows that Crimea is, for now, off the table. That\u2019s the alternative to the destruction of Ukraine and nuclear war. You can make heroic statements, if you\u2019d like, about not liking hurricanes, or not liking the solution. But that\u2019s not doing anyone any good. ROBINSON: The Biden administration has seemeddisinclined to pursue the possible diplomatic solutionssince before the invasion. The perspective that Americans get in the media is, essentially, that Putin has invaded Ukraine due to psychopathy, and it\u2019s nowour jobto funnel arms to the Ukrainians. And the only real debate is,how much in arms should we give them?And should we simply give them arms? Or should we intervene militarily? And that is the debate. But a more rational way of looking at this, as you say, would be to think about how to prevent Ukrainians from dying in this horrible war. And that would very alter the range of perceived options. CHOMSKY:I would agree except for the word \u201crational.\u201d It\u2019s the morehumaneway. Hitler was perfectly rational, you know; it\u2019s not a matter of rationality. You can be rational for genocide and extermination. Henry Kissinger, who\u2019s much lauded in the United States\u2014I\u2019m sure he was being quite rational when he issued an order to the U.S. Air Force transmitted from his half-drunk boss, Richard Nixon. The order was, I\u2019m quoting it, massive bombing campaign in Cambodia, \u201canything that flies on anything that moves,\u201d in other words, wipe out the place. It\u2019s a call for mass genocide. I don\u2019t think you can find a counterpart in the archival record; you might try. Well, that was perfectlyrational. It was a way to get ahead in Washington. This was to move on to greater glory, nothing irrational about that. In fact, that worked very well. He\u2019s now one of the most honored and respected people in the country. That\u2019s, incidentally, only one part. If we dared to look at American history, we could learn a lot. ROBINSON: So it\u2019s not that the United States is acting in a way that doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s that when you look at the history of U.S. policy, you see us doing things that are, as you say, perfectly rational, but just happen to be sociopathic. And that\u2019s true in incident after incident. CHOMSKY:So take another one of Kissinger\u2019s achievements: overthrowing the parliamentary government in Chile, and installing thevicious and murderousPinochet dictatorship.Right to this minute, Chileans are trying to liberate themselves from those consequences. Kissinger was very rational; he had reasons. And the reasons are worth listening to. He said,If reformist parliamentary democracy succeeds in Chile, it\u2019ll have a very harmful effect. It\u2019ll reach as far as Southern Europe, where Italy and Spain are toying with parliamentary left parties\u2014what was called Euro communism, basically social democracy. We don\u2019t want this virus to spread contagion all the way to Europe. So, therefore, we better wipe it out in Chile. Is itrational? That\u2019s standard politics. That\u2019s why we went to war in Vietnam in the early \u201850s. You look back at the internal records\u2014quite rational. After what\u2019s called the fall of China, we have to make sure that the virus of successful independent nationalism doesn\u2019t spreadcontagion\u2014Kissinger\u2019s phrase\u2014to other countries in the region, ultimately leading Japan to accommodate to an independent East Asia, meaning we have lost the Pacific War, which was fought to prevent that. Well, that\u2019s not what you\u2019re taught in school, or even what you\u2019re reading in most scholarship, but that\u2019s what happened. It\u2019s case after case. The great European statesmen likeMetternich, Kissinger\u2019s models, were terrified by the American Revolution, which might spread the curse of republicanism, meaning parliamentary democracy, over much of the world and break down the European system of global domination. The U.S. didn\u2019t invent it. And if we had a free country, where people learned about the reality of the world, I wouldn\u2019t have to say this. Everybody would have learned it in high school. ROBINSON: A theme that runs through every part of your work on American foreign policy is that beneath all of the highfalutin rhetoric about freedom and democracy, if we actually look closely at the facts, what we see is a continuous horrific record of human suffering. Whether it\u2019s people beingfirebombed in Tokyo or in Dresden and Hamburg, or whether it\u2019speople in villages in Vietnamor whether it\u2019sIraqis, we see a horrific record of human suffering that we turn away from. Despite what American political leaders might believe\u2014they mightbelievethatthey\u2019re idealists, they might believe that they are people who are sincerely concerned with combating authoritarianism\u2014when we actually evaluate their actions, what we see is a real, ruthless self-interest consistently driving our actions in the world. CHOMSKY:We\u2019re no different from others. Take our predecessor in imperial domination, Britain. The hideous record of centuries of British imperialism is just barely beginning to come to light. Now, Caroline Elkins has a very important book [Legacy of Violence] just out on the history of British imperialism. Shashi Tharoor, who\u2019s Indian, came out recently with a book on the history of British imperialism [Inglorious Empire: What the British Did to India]. This is just beginning to lift the veil on the hideous crimes that Britain was committing for centuries. Meanwhile, the British intellectuals were praising themselves as the most moral people in the world, even including the best of them, like say John Stuart Mill. It\u2019s pretty hard to find an intellectual of higher moral standing. So what was he doing? Well, go back to 1857, one of the peaks of British criminal activity: vicious, murderous destruction of uprising in India. Mill knew all about it. He was an agent of the East India Company. Mill wrote afamous essay, which is taught in law schools in the United States, apparently without understanding what he said. It\u2019s worth reading. It\u2019s an article on intervention, and he said we should be opposed to intervention in the affairs of others, but he said there are exceptions. One exception is when a country like Britain carries out the intervention because Britain, he said, is anangeliccountry. It\u2019s not like other countries. In fact, we\u2019re so magnificent that other countries can\u2019t understand it and the heap obloquy upon us because they can\u2019t understand that the actions we take are for the benefit of mankind. When we slaughter Indians, and conquer more of India, to increase our control of the opium trade, so we can break into China by force, they just can\u2019t understand howangelicwe are, so they criticize us. But nevertheless, we have to put their criticism aside, recognize that they\u2019re just not capable of understanding our magnificence and go ahead with our humane actions."

    "output": "ROBINSON: Similar stories of professed noble intent can be heard in Russia\u2019s justifications for the invasion of Ukraine. As you point out, every powerful country tells itself noble and uplifting myths in order to justify its atrocities. But the United States, in particular, does have this kind of extreme lack of self-awareness and is extremely hypocritical in our condemnations of other countries without a willingness to perform similar acts of scrutiny on ourselves. CHOMSKY:Biden just announced thatPutin is a war criminal, that we have to take him to war crimes trials. Well, I do lots of interviews and talks all over the world, virtually, a lot in the Global South. You can read it in the newspapers. When asked, \u201cWhat do you think about Biden\u2019s statement?\u201d they have an answer. Their answer is, \u201cIt takes one to know one.\u201d And yet there\u2019s praise for the marvelous courage of someone who says Putin is a war criminal. You can read articles in the prestigious Atlantic Council expressing intense moral outrage about Russia\u2019s hideous crimes in Ukraine. You take a look at the people who were writing those articles, go back a couple of years, they were issuing praise for the marvelous achievement of the invasion of Iraq, using rhetoric which would have embarrassed the most abject apparatchik in Russia praising the noble intentions, the effort to bring democracy to backward Iraq. People in the Global South don\u2019t have to be reminded. They\u2019ve been at the receiving end of terror and torture. About an hour ago, I had an interview with Belgian state television. We were talking about this, and brought up some recent crimes like Belgium\u2019s assassination of [Congolese independence leader]Patrice Lumumba, who was the hope for Africa. The major country of Africa, the Congo,suffered hideouslyunder Belgian atrocities, even worse than most of the European atrocities, which is a pretty high bar to get over. Then they finally decolonized in 1960: the main country in Africa, enormous resources, could have been a rich country, it was leading Africa towards freedom and development. The U.S. and Belgium weren\u2019t having that. Eisenhowerissued a hit; CIA was supposed to murder Lumumba. They didn\u2019t manage. Belgian intelligence got there first and turned Congointo a horror chamberever since. That\u2019s not ancient history. People in the Global South know those things. They know aboutIraq,Central America, andVietnam.They know what we\u2019ve done.So when they hear these pronouncements, they just either crack up in ridicule or can\u2019t believe what\u2019s going on in this uncivilized, barbaric area of the world that is Europe and the United States. ROBINSON: I\u2019d like to go back to the subject of nuclear weapons and the path away from civilization-ending war. We discussed Hiroshima. And obviously in the decades after the end of the Second World War, the U.S. and the USSR essentially developed elaborate plans for how to wipe each other off the face of the earth. They essentially planned a global genocide. It never actually happened. We made it through the Cold War. But this is what we\u2019re talking about when we talk about these weapons: the possibility of genocide on a scale never seen before. InPolitico, there\u2019s a headline: debate heating up on Capitol Hill on funding the military.Democrats are facing a dilemma of whether to back the historically high Pentagon budget or spend even more. There\u2019s an article inForeign Affairs: \u201cAmerica Must Spend More on Defense,\u201d saying that it is necessary for the United States to modernize, update, and expand its nuclear weapons. A Democratic Representative from Virginia is quoted as saying that we need to get to 5% of GDP spent on our military, that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take to \u201cmodernize\u201d the nuclear enterprise and make a serious investment in deterring Chinese aggression against Taiwan."

    "input": "So I want to ask you: how do we begin to pull back from this? When I extrapolate into the future and think about these ever-increasing military budgets and more and more nuclear weapons, it\u2019s absolutely terrifying. What\u2019s the alternate path for us away from this danger?",
    "output": "CHOMSKY:The U.S. strategic posture\u2014the current one\u2014was established by Jim Mattis of the 2018 Trump administration. [It\u2019s as follows:] We have to shift from what was called the Global War on Terror. (I won\u2019t talk about what it really was, but what wascalledthe Global War on Terror.) We have to shift from that to confrontation with peer powers, to confrontation with China and Russia. We have to be powerful enough to be able to defeat both of them in a nuclear war. If there\u2019s a better definition of lunacy, I\u2019d be interested in hearing it. Actually, we did hear a better definition of lunacy. When the Democrats came in, Joe Biden updated the strategic posture by saying that\u2014they don\u2019t use the wordcontainanymore\u2014wehave toencircleChinawith a rim of sentinel states. And we have to advance their armament with precision weapons aimed at China. So we have to form a rim from South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, India\u2014which is a reluctant partner\u2014to encircle China to deter their aggression. So we\u2019re deterring Chinese aggression off the coast of China. Okay. In other words,we own the world.We carry out aggression and violence anywhere we like because we own the world. But if China is doing things we don\u2019t like, off its coast, we have to encircle them with sentinel states, armed to the teeth and aimed at China. That\u2019s considered very liberal...forthcoming.Yay, Biden. We have to defend ourselves from Chinese aggression. And there are things that China is doing that they shouldn\u2019t be doing, like they\u2019re violating international law in the South China Sea. The United States is not in a particularly strong position to make a fuss about that, since the United States is the only maritime powernot even to have ratified the Law of the Sea. But that\u2019s us. We own and run the world. So we don\u2019t have to ratify anything. We establish what writers of foreign policy will call the \u201crule-based liberal order.\u201d We do support that becausewe set the rules. So, therefore, we want the rule-based international order, not this old-fashioned, UN-based international order where we don\u2019t set the rules. That\u2019s no good; that goes out the window. Now we have our rule-based order, and part of it is to encircle China with sentinel states with more advanced precision weapons. Meanwhile, wesend Australia a fleet of nuclear submarinesto combat China in the South China Sea, where China has maybe half a dozen old-fashioned diesel submarines, which you can easily detect. They don\u2019t have what we have. We have to send a fleet of nuclear submarines, which are advertised publicly as able to enter a Chinese port and silently attack any Chinese target. We have to defend ourselves against the Chinese threat. We, of course, have a fleet of advanced nuclear submarines, but they\u2019re not sophisticated enough.One Trident submarinenow can destroy almost 200 cities anywhere in the world. But that\u2019s not enough. So we have to get rid of them and upgrade them to more advanced ones,Virginia-class submarines. One Trident submarine destroying 200 cities anywhere in the world: We can\u2019t get by with that. We\u2019ve got to update it. Well, we send nuclear submarines to Australia to counter the Chinese threat off their coast. Well, that\u2019s liberal America. Okay. You go over to the Republican side:not enough.It\u2019s what you quoted. We have to increase our military budget to defend ourselves from the Chinese and the Russians. Germany has toraise its defense budgetbecause Russia might attack it. The Russian army\u2014which can\u2019t conquer cities 30 kilometers from the Russian border which are not defended by a modern army\u2014is poised to attackGermany. So we\u2019re supposed to believe. So Germany has to increase its military budget. You can see why we\u2019re so terrified. This goes way back in American history, back to the Declaration of Independence. We piously cite it every July 4: condemning King George the Third for unleashing against us the \u201cmerciless Indian savages,\u201d whose known way of warfare was destruction and torture against the innocent Americans who are just coming with a peace pipe. We justhave todefend ourselves. It\u2019s terrible how we\u2019reattackedall the time."

We urgently need to restore the reach and punch of our atrophied military.\u201dThat\u2019s insanity, right?",
    "output": "CHOMSKY:They love it in the offices of Lockheed Martin, I\u2019m sure. But what we ought to be doing in a humane world is working to, first of all, restore the arms control regime, which was torn to shreds by the Republican Party. First, George W. Bush, whodismantled the ABM treaty. That\u2019s a serious threat to Russia. Then Donald Trump, whose wrecking ball destroyed whatever else he could find, including the Reagan-GorbachevINF Treaty, which prevented short range nuclear missiles in Europe and greatly reduced the threat of war. So Trump got rid of that. And just to make sure that everyone understood he was serious, he arranged, along with Jim Mattis, that as soon as the treaty was dismantled immediately, within weeks, the U.S.carried out tests of weapons designed to violate the treaty. To make sure the Russians understand:We\u2019re coming after you with missiles that can attack you, and you\u2019ll never even know they\u2019re coming.That was one of Trump\u2019s major steps. He also went after theOpen Skies Treaty, which went back to Eisenhower. Remember, Eisenhower was the last conservative president in the United States. There have been no conservatives since Eisenhower, only radical extremist reactionaries who poison the honorable term conservative. Eisenhower was a legitimate conservative, who, like him or not, did a lot of rotten things, a lot of good things. But he initiated the Open Skies Treaty. Well, Trump went after that. He didn\u2019t have time to destroy them all. But in hisnext term in power, they\u2019ll get rid of the rest of them. Meanwhile, it\u2019s greatly enhancing the threat of war,doing wonders for the arms industry, improving electoral prospects if you can terrify the population enough. And that\u2019s not very hard for a frightened population. Not very hard when you have people like me who as kids were playing cowboys and Indians. We were the Cowboys. When you can have a society with a culture like that, you can get by with enhancing the threat of nuclear war becausewe\u2019re under attack. Okay. That\u2019s what we should be doing. I mean, one of the things that Ambassador Freeman pointed out in his very astute remarks a couple of days ago was that if you look at the history of Europe, which was the most savage place in the world for centuries, they finally reached the peace treaty, the Treaty of 1815,the Vienna treaty, and the way they reached peace was by accommodating all of the warring powers, including the defeated power, which had been the aggressor in recent years, namely the Napoleonic France, which had virtually conquered Europe. So they accommodated France within the peace treaty. And that led to a century of pretty much peace. There were some wars but minor ones by European standards. That lasted until 1914. A century. What did we do after the First World War? We didn\u2019t bring Germany in; we punished Germany instead. Not the wisdom of the Tsar and Metternich. The result? Nazi Germany. After the Second World War, there was a possibility of incorporating Russia within a general system of peace, accommodation, trade integration, commercial integration, cultural immigration, and so on, which was proposed by Charles de Gaulle, one of the few statesmen in the post-war period. It was what he called \u201cEurope from the Atlantic to the Urals,\u201d with no military alliances. The German Prime Minister pushed in the same direction. Gorbachev, in 1991, when Russia was collapsing, proposed a vision of an independent Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok, with no military alliances. Since the Second World War, the U.S. position was that Europe should fall within what\u2019s called theAtlanticistframework, the native framework, which the U.S. runs. Europe should be subordinate to the United States. That\u2019s one option. The other option is aEuropeanCommon home, independent force in world affairs, no military alliances\u2014that\u2019s been a struggle all the way through since the Second World War, very much alive today. Macron and his limited initiatives towards Putin were pushing in the same direction. Putin in his criminal stupidity lost the opportunity. If there had been a single statesman in the Kremlin, what they would have done is grasp that opportunity. Europe had many reasons to want to have better relations with Russia. Trade complementarity, which is perfectly obvious, lots of reasons. Would have been an inducement; could have worked. We don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t try it. Instead, Putin did what every man of violence does: reach for the violent option, attack Ukraine with criminal aggression, and hand the United States on a silver platter its most fervent wish: Europe deep in its pocket. More than ever before. The greatest gift that the Kremlin could have given Washington, while it stabs itself in the back. That\u2019s calledstatesmanship.Okay. Quite apart from the criminal aggression. That happens to be the current state of the world. And Europe is falling for it. Like Germany, we have to arm ourselves to defend ourselves from a military force that can\u2019t conquer a city a couple of miles from its border. ROBINSON: It seems as if there is a path to a peaceful world. One of the things that\u2019s so frustrating is that you would think that war and nuclear annihilation would be easily avoidable, considering how many people in the world want to live peaceful and happy and prosperous lives, how many donotwant to destroy everything they love. But while I can see how the policy decisions\u2014how arms control agreements, how the various turning points in history where decisions could have been made differently, like NATO expansion, that sort of thing\u2014could be done differently... all of that gives me some hope that there are possible paths to lasting peace. But what I don\u2019t know is how we\u2019re ever going get past having a country with a culture where people can hear that a city has been destroyed and go back to playing baseball. The more Iread about the Second World War, and the more I read about Vietnam\u2014that\u2019s the thing that really chills me. And the thing that I appreciate about your work is that you are someone who can\u2019t get these things off your mind: the colossal human suffering that our country\u2019s decisions inflict upon people. It\u2019s hard to know how to end it. People can look at it, and then immediately look away. CHOMSKY:It\u2019s not easy. Let\u2019s put aside Ukraine for a moment. It\u2019s not the only crisis in the world. Right now, for example, literally,millions of Afghans are facing starvation. There is food in the markets, but Afghans, who have a little money, have to watch their children starve, because they can\u2019t go to the bank to get their own money to buy some food in the market. Why? Becausethe Biden administration stole their money. Okay, simple as that. Their money was in U.S. banks. Banks are supposed to have a fiduciary responsibility. When a bank takes your money, it\u2019s because you trust them to let you get the money back when you want it. Not U.S. banks. The U.S. government wants to steal some other country\u2019s money. Just do it. So right now, we decided to steal Afghanistan\u2019s money, which is in U.S. banks. And there\u2019s even a pretext given, which makes it worse. The pretext isAmericans might want compensation for the harm of 9/11for which Afghans had zero responsibility. None. You may recall that the Talibanoffered to surrender, handing over the Al Qaeda suspect. The U.S. response was:We do not negotiate surrenders.We\u2019re gonna smash you up properly. Okay. We don\u2019t care about Al Qaeda. We don\u2019t care about 9/11. We got other things on our mind. Okay. Then comes 20 years of destruction of Afghanistan. And now, let\u2019s steal their money so they can starve. Can we do anything about that? With the flick of a wrist? Do we discuss it? Try to find it. Okay. That\u2019s not the only case. We could go on. ROBINSON: Well, thank you so much, Professor Chomsky. Really appreciate it. CHOMSKY:Thank you."
